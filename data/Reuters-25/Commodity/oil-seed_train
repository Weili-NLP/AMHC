'Congress should give the U.S. Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean loan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export competitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said.     Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out of the current soybean program \"dilemma\" would be for Congress to allow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if the loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to further buydown the loan rate.     Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be less than 4.77 dlrs per bu.     Amstutz\' suggestion would be for Congress to change the farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56 dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs.     The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the 4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut.     Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on soybean program changes will be the budget costs.     He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that the U.S. loan rate provides an \"umbrella\" to foreign production and causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans.     Asked about the American Soybean Association\'s request for some form of income support, Amstutz said \"the competitive problem is the most severe.\" He said USDA is still studying the situation and \"no resolution\" has yet been found.  \n',oilseed

'Several leading farm-state Congressmen said they will press the U.S. Agriculture Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income.     Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen and representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the subject in the next two weeks.     \"Let\'s see if we can try to push them (USDA) to do something without legislation,\" Glickman told the hearing.     The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs per bushel with no income protection, or marketing loan.     David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, president said USDA must make changes in the soybean program.     The current soybean program \"gave us the worst of both worlds,\" ASA\'s Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate is too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of soybean production in South America, he said. At the same time, the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income support for soybean farmers, Haggard said.     \"We need some kind of market loan,\" he added.     The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA so far has resisted pressure to use the authority.     Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA, but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they would seriously consider offering a marketing loan.     USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the soybean situation is a \"dilemna\" which has been studied extensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any changes, are under consideration.     In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other than a marketing loan which should be considered to help soybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment, or a direct payment program.     Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will rise to 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of soybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year.     \"Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil\'s entire soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987,\" Haggard said.     However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in making soybean program changes that might allow the European Community to challenge the U.S. program under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.     He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean production and loss of that market would be devastating.     The Reagan administration has given \"mixed signals\" on whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be successfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said.     While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu loan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorsed a proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a six dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.     The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois.     Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take some action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loan could mean a substantial increase in budget costs.     Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one to 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget.     Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu combined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price might fall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost the government a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costs would decline as market prices recovered.  \n',oilseed
'The European Community\'s (EC) executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of its ambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farm surpluses, after strong attacks from northern states.     Britain and West Germany, backed by the Netherlands and Denmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which has already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC led by the U.S. and from EC consumer groups, diplomats said.     But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen told journalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the tax, proposed last month as part of the Commission\'s annual farm price package, would leave a large hole in the group\'s budget.     He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind up for good. \"I hope the debate is still open, if not there will be a formidable hole in the budget,\" he said.     The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and would be only slightly less this year, he said.     Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead of farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as unprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministers recognised the importance of reforming the EC\'s farm policy.     The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extra cash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels and to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by making it more competitive with other oils.     Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oil producers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by the tax.     \"What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be better understood not just outside the community but at home,\" he said.     Britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the EC\'s costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal to impose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats could seriously damage the EC\'s trade relations with other countries.     Britain also warned that the tax could hit developing countries already receiving aid from the EC, they said.     The Commission also defended proposals to dismantle Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross border subsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism.     In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to EC executive Commission President, Jacques Delors, Kohl made clear such a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers.     Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism at the talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany had been alone in its opposition. The question was a key aspect of the Commission\'s farm price proposals, he added.    Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid the EC of its butter mountain, despite Spanish and Portuguese opposition.     The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of unwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning it into animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices.     National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of savings from another plan to curb milk production.     Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by the scheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massive surpluses built up before they joined the community last year, but the two countries did not block today\'s vote.  \n',oilseed
'The outcome of negotiations on proposals by the European Commission for a 330 Ecus a tonne tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds and marine oils remains difficult to predict, Belgian agriculture minister Paul de Keersmaeker told a news conference.

Yesterday, British minister Michael Jopling said Britain, West Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands and Denmark were opposed to the measure.

It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target.     Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000 tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000 tonnes in 1985/86.

Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to come on stream in early 1988.     China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while the U.S. Provides the rest, it said.     \"This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are willing to pay a premium for them,\" it said.     Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both 1986/87 and 1987/88.     \"Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient supply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems,\" the report said.  \n',oilseed

Japan imported 128,089 tonnes of Brazilian beans in calendar 1986, Finance Ministry customs-cleared statistics show.     The sources said Brazilian beans were cheaper than U.S. Origin which may account for the heavy purchases, but added there were concerns about deliveries from Brazil in the near term due to labour problems there.

Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices in Chicago plus the FOB premium.     Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986 crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some 300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.     Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the sources said.

'U.S. soybean lobbyists and congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S. soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs per bushel next year.     \"I don\'t know who in Congress would propose that happening. Politically it would be totally unacceptable,\" an aide to a senior farm-state senator said.     USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan  at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.     \"I\'m convinced that Congress will not go along with this,\" American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said.     Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive.     His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the administration\'s position is in the debate over what should be done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect soybean farmers\' income.     Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices competitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues to maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move would be too costly.     \"There will be alot of other options that will be considered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutz proposal,\" said Bill O\'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.     \"Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean loan,\" O\'Conner said.     Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr basic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to increase soybean\'s competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen.

'The Agriculture Department must make a decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loan or more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to the government and foreign soybean production will increase, the president of the American Soybean Association, ASA, said.     \"The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another ... USDA can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) as much as they want, but they have to eventually address this problem,\" David Haggard, ASA president, tolds.     USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options, and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on the soybean loan, Haggard said.     \"I don\'t know if USDA is really very serious about addressing the soybean loan problem,\" he said.

The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., which call for either a 5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment.     Haggard said he does not know what chances the ASA-backed proposals have but said, \"in all honesty, we do not want to see the farm bill be torn apart.\"     He said if USDA feels it cannot withdraw its opposition to a market loan, there are still numerous ways the USDA could change the loan without new legislation.     Making the loan partially in certificates which would not have to be paid back would be one option, he said.  \n',oilseed
'Taiwan bought 25,000 tonnes U.S. soybeans today at 203.40 dlrs a tonne, C and F, Gulf, for May 15-30 shipment, private export sources said.  \n',oilseed
'The joint committee of Taiwan\'s soybean importers awarded a contract to Richco Grain Ltd of New York to supply a 27,000-tonne cargo of U.S. Soybeans, a committee spokesman tolds.     The shipment, priced at 210.34 U.S. Dlrs per tonne c and f Taiwan, is set for delivery between March 20 and April 5, he said.     Taiwan\'s soybeans imports in calendar 1987 are targetted at 1.81 mln tonnes, against an actual 1.74 mln tonnes imported in 1986, he said.     All the imports come from the U.S., He added.  \n',oilseed
'The joint committee of Taiwan\'s soybean importers will tender March 12 for a 27,000 tonne cargo of U.S. Soybeans for March 20 to April 5 delivery, a committee spokesman tolds.     Taiwan\'s soybean imports in calendar 1987 are provisionally set at 1.81 mln tonnes compared with a revised 1.74 mln tonnes imported last year.     The 1.74 mln tonne figure was revised from 1.76 mln tonnes.     Taiwan imports all its soybeans from the United States.  \n',oilseed
'American soybean producers are confident the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable oils and fats will be rejected but are leaving nothing to chance, American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne Bennett said.     Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean producer delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, was speaking at a lunch.     After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this morning, he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would vote against the proposal, as had a number of other countries.     \"Our information suggests we will have the required number of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward,\" he said.     \"The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20 years, and dropped every time. What we want now is to kill it once and for all,\" Bennett added.     Backing up the soybean producers\' active lobbying, the U.S. Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through, he said.     The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fight the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.     U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for one-fifth of annual production, and are worth about 2.5 billion dlrs a year, Bennett said.     The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U.S. Producers badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of soyoil in the EC, which would suffer far worse than other higher-priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax, he added.     The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to finance the EC\'s own oilseed subsidy machine, he said.     \"We in the ASA are dedicated free-traders. We helped defeat the Wine Equity Act two years ago, but we will not stand by and watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC measures,\" Bennett said.     \"The mood in the U.S. Is turning increasingly protectionist, and the EC\'s actions are fueling the chances of a trade war,\" he added.  \n',oilseed
'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said a marketing loan for soybeans would serve no present purpose because the U.S. price is not above the world price.     Asked in an interview if it was time to consider a marketing loan for soybeans, Lyng said, \"I don\'t think so. I don\'t think the world price is lower than our price anyway.\"     However, the USDA secretary said that if current conditions of surplus production persisted, it might be appropriate to consider a marketing loan.     \"I suppose that under that condition there is a danger our exports will continue to drop and that the government will continue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans,\" he said. \"It might be (worth contemplating a marketing loan), if there were a world market that was lower than our market.\"  \n',oilseed
'Soybeans produced in the United States face a competitive price problem because of the loan rate provisions of the 1985 farm bill, U.S. Undersecretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said.     Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a \"squeeze\" because the Farm Bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rates while limiting the soybean reduction.     As a result, he said U.S.-produced soybeans \"have a price problem\" in competing with other soybean producing countries.     Amstutz called the situation a \"dilemma\" for the USDA, and said \"we have spent hours in ASCS (Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service) looking at this.\"     He did not say what may be done to rectify the situation.  \n',oilseed
'Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.     Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agriculture\'s annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.     \"Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils,\" Balletto said.     Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln tonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.     He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance at 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.     Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said, disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.     \"If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the crush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop,\" he said.     \"This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds,\" Balletto said.     Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies, he said.     World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes, compared with 25.4 mln last year.     The increase should result from lower disappearance, as production is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7 mln last year, he said.     World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln tonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said, while production of other oilseeds was lower.     Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States, he said.     Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S. stocks make up most of those, Balletto said.     The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes, about half of the world soybean surplus, he said.     Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased 13.1 mln tonnes.     \"During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1 mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the U.S. loan program.\"     \"Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long as the U.S. soybean surplus continues.     For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the U.S. loan program.     \"Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the U.S. loan rate.\"     The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said.  \n',oilseed
