'Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. ABNN.AS chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank\'s 10.3 pct increase in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar.     Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release of ABN\'s 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance, notably in the securities business.     He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10 share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank\'s stock.     News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN\'s share price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.     Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and ABN\'s share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.     Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986 by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1 pct to 242 mln guilders, he added.     Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings margins via traditional lending activities, he said.     Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank stocks recently.     He said that of the bank\'s estimated 25 financially troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said.     He added that losses incurred through loans to tin producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had been written off.  \n',earn
'The Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd ADSA.S (Adsteam) said its one-for-five rights issue at 11.50 dlrs a share will raise 228.5 mln dlrs for general working capital and investment, both in Australia and overseas.     The group announced the issue with its first half earnings and said in a statement that the rights issue will be followed by a one-for-four bonus issue.     Adsteam\'s equity-accounted net earnings rose to 75.05 mln dlrs in the half ended December 31 from 55.68 mln a year earlier and interim dividend to 18 cents from 16.     Adsteam shares eased to 14.20 dlrs from an opening 14.60 and yesterday\'s close of 14.50 on the issue announcement.     The issue will be underwritten by Morgan Grenfell Australia Ltd and McCaughan Dyson Ltd apart from the shares to be taken up by Adsteam\'s associate and largest shareholder, department store retailer David Jones Ltd.     New shares will not rank for the interim dividend but will rank equally thereafter.     Adsteam said it expects to maintain an annual dividend rate of 36 cents on capital enlarged to about 149 mln shares by both issues from 99.36 mln.     Adsteam said its diverse industrial interests generally performed well and its results, as the ultimate holding company and beneficiary, reflected this solid performance.     David Jones, owned 49.2 pct by Adsteam, earned the largest associates\' net of 57.38 mln dlrs in the half against 40.29 mln a year earlier, Adsteam\'s figures show.     Wholly-owned and joint venture companies also did well apart from timber, building supplies and real estate, which returned below-budget profits due to the housing downturn.

'Italy\'s national airline, Alitalia Spa AZPI.MI, reporting a 14.6 pct rise in provisional 1986 net profit, said it carried seven pct more passengers on domestic routes last year, but 11.5 pct fewer passengers on flights from North America and Canada.     Alitalia said the drop in North American traffic had been due to a general fall in the numbers of American tourists visiting Europe caused by fears of terrorism.     The airline reported provisional net profit rose to 55 billion lire from 48 billion in 1985.     A spokesman said Alitalia was hoping for an increase in traffic with the U.S. In 1987.     It planned to increase the number of flights from Italy to New York to 19 per week, to reinstate flights to Boston and to re-open the direct Rome-Milan-Los Angeles service.

'Allied-Lyons PLC sees rising profits from 51-pct-owned liquor producer Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts in the current fiscal year ending in early March, 1988, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in a speech prepared for delivery to Toronto analysts.     \"We anticipate that Hiram Walker profits will be well above those of the plateau years,\" he said, referring to the four years up to 1985.     \"In other words, we will have regained the 1985 position and improved on it,\" Holden-Brown said.     Allied-Lyons won control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham last year in a battle against Gulf Canada Corp, which finally got a 49 pct stake after an out-of-court settlement.     Hiram Walker Resources Ltd, the previous owner, reported liquor profits of 282 mln Canadian dlrs in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1985, 278 mln dlrs in 1984, 267 mln in 1983, 294 mln in 1982 and 280 mln in 1981.     Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons\' financial results for the fiscal year just ended March seven would include three months of Hiram Walker-Gooderham profits, but he did not provide actual figures.     He said Hiram Walker-Gooderham\'s profit improvement in the current year will come from a previously announced reorganization put into effect March 1, 1987 and a close partnership with Allied-Lyons\' existing Allied Vintners division.  \n',earn
'Allied-Lyons PLC will report substantial growth in the second half of fiscal 1987 ended March 7, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in answer to reporters\' queries.     \"You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyons in the second half,\" Holden-Brown said following a presentation to Toronto securities analysts.     Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year.     Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs associated with Elders IXL Ltd\'s failed take-over bid for the company, Holden-Brown also said.     But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons\' sale of its 24.9 pct interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said.     \"So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But hopefully you win them all in the end,\" Holden-Brown said.     Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other take-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: \"No, I don\'t.\"     \"We must never be complacent and we must always be very watchful, but I think we would be very expensive,\" he said.     Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons\' share price to corporate earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies in the food and beverage industry.     \"That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had come a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I think,\" Holden-Brown said.     Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons\' move to acquire Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders take-over bid for the company was \"100 pct a growth action.\"     \"We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and that people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was) defensive, but it never was,\" Holden-Brown told reporters.     Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram Walker, Holden-Brown responded: \"Plan might be too strong a word. But I must say I do feel the need for Allied-Lyons to be better known in Canada.\"  \n',earn
'Schweizerische Aluminium AG, Alusuisse, plans to reduce share and participation certificate capital by 50 pct to cover losses in 1986 and those carried forward from the previous year, chief executive Hans Jucker said.     Jucker told a news conference that the greatest drain on its financial resources had been stopped, but after extraordinary charges the net loss of 688 mln francs in 1986 was only slightly under the 756 mln loss of the previous year.     The losses in 1986 and those carried over from 1985 made it necessary to reduce capital by 50 pct, he said.     However, Jucker said the company improved liquidity through a recovery in cash flow and conversion of 300 mln Swiss francs of credit into a subordinated loan.     Trading in Alusuisse shares was suspended on the Zurich stock exchange after today\'s announcement by the company that it would cut its share capital by 50 pct, the bourse said. Trading would resume again on Monday.  \n',earn
'Schweizerische Aluminimum AG ALUZ.Z (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said.     \"The threshold of profitability has returned to the foreseeable future,\" he said. \"We expect already in 1987 approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that our industrial environment does not worsen.\"     He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past losses.     Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986 after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985.     Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion.     Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for 1985.     But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news conference the new management installed a year ago had decided to restate the previous five years\' accounts to eliminate rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an asset.     Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from 472 mln in 1985.     It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining, after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in 1985.     Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from 1985, had wiped out the company\'s remaining reserves and exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a 50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22.     Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this \"radical elimination of the mortgages of the past\" painful, but said the foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy.     Haerri said despite the losses, the company\'s liquidity was strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56 billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion.     Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111 mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct in 1985.     In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland SBGZ.Z, Swiss Bank Corp SBVZ.Z and Credit Suisse CRSZ.Z, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan.     The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987.     Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts.     That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169 mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a 479 mln loss instead of 179 mln.     The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders\' equity of 1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar alternations were made for previous years.     After 1986 losses, shareholder\'s equity stood at only 895 mln francs.  \n',earn

'The recent deterioration in the steel market makes it important for Arbed SA ARBB.BR to maintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in a statement.     It reported that its competitive position had weakened considerably in the second half of 1986, leading to a seven pct cut in steel output over the whole of the year to 3.74 mln tonnes.     Arbed had managed to make a 890 mln franc net profit, slightly down from the 1.12 billion profit in 1985, thanks to lower raw material costs and prudent management, the company said.     Arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the market deteriorate further, but the decision of the European Community to maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally, should under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect.

Capital spending for the year was 119 mln dlrs against 105 mln for the previous year with 50 new stores opened, but total sales were below target, Woolworths said.

'British Columbia Resources Investment Corp, earlier reporting higher full year operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a four year term.     The company said the credit facility is extendable under certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals and completion of formal documentation.     It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs.     B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2 preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain suspended.     However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company\'s trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.     Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred shareholders, with payment expected in early April to shareholders of record March 31, the company said.     If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co WTC, B.C. Resources said.     The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia.

Gains on the sales of Westar Timber\'s Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the company said.

Turnover rose by by more than one billion dlrs to 3.6 billion, the parent company said in a statement. The rise, however, partly reflected the inclusion of the first full business year of three acquisitions made in 1985. Excluding these, BASF Corp turnover rose four pct from 1985.     Acquisitions were the high-performance connecting materials operations of Celanese Corp, Inmont Corp bought from United Technologies and American Enka bought from AKZO NV AKZO.AS.     BASF said it expected a U.S. Investment of 240 mln dlrs in 1987, part of a five-year programme totalling one billion.     U.S. Projects completed in 1986 included the second acrylic acid plant in Freeport, Texas, a technical centre in Southfield, Michigan, in which paint lines from automotive plants can be refitted, and the new agricultural research centre in Research Triangle Park in Durham, North Carolina.     BASF said that work this year had begun in Geismar, Louisiana, on plants for production of special amines and polytetrahydrofuran, as well as for expansion of capacity for producing tetrahydrofuran.  \n',earn
'A strong performance from all BAT Industries Plc\'s BTI.L major sectors enabled the group\'s 1986 pretax profits to pass the one billion stg level for the third year running, Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement.     The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39 billion, which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.     Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth Avenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper.     Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a four pct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume.     The results were largely in line with analysts expectations and BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT.     BAT said the U.S. Brown and Williamson unit held most of its 1985 gains and increased profit 18 pct in dollar terms.     Financial services saw profits double to 282 mln with both Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth.     Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual premiums to 39 mln stg. BAT said it increased new business by 38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first quarter. Its permanent health insurance was now the market leader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in the U.K.     Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1.03 billion. Its life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting results in the second half.     Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio dropped to 41 pct from 51 pct. The net ratio, at 26 pct, left the group strongly placed to pursue its further development.     Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg, nearly three times the 1982 level, with Wiggins Teape\'s sales rising 36 pct to pass one billion stg.     BAT said in 1986 it had sold 88 BATUS stores in the U.S. For 644 mln dlrs and sold Grovewood Securities for 142 mln stg.  \n',earn
'BAT Industries Plc BTI.L 1986 results, which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed the company was in a strong position and that its shares were probably undervalued, share analysts said.     BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading after a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538p earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39 billion pre-tax.     Stock market analysts said today\'s generally weak stock market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the share price.     \"In the current market, people almost expect companies to beat expectations,\" said one analyst, adding that pretax profits of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.     BAT\'s 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985 pretax profit of 1.17 billion.     Brokers noted that BAT\'s shift away from its underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.     BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74 pct four years ago.     Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company declining further as other sectors increased in importance.     He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial services, in particular in the U.S.     Sheehy also said the group had \"no sizeable acquisitions\" in sight in the near future.     Analysts said BAT\'s increasingly good performance in the U.K. Insurance area was encouraging.     Its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16 pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to make major acquisitions, they said.  \n',earn
'Chemicals group Bayer AG BAYG.F said it expects to post another good result in 1987 after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986.     The company said that this was despite the mark\'s further strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and despite an increase in competitive pressure.     \"The further progress of our business will depend largely on the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy costs.     Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year\'s record of 3.15 billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72 billion from 1.62 billion.     The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985 results, up one mark from a year earlier.     Bayer said that world group operating profit declined slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed a further improvement.     Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to 40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark.     Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought pressure on selling prices, it added.     In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against 1985, the company said without giving details.     \"The western Europe, North America and Far East regions developed well in local currency, but here too the translation of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture, especially in the case of North America,\" it said.     Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in 1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks.     Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986, resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset falling prices and cost increases in other areas.     The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income. Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw materials all developed well, it said.     Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period.     Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower.     Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarter against 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985.  \n',earn
'Bayerische Vereinsbank AG BVMG.F expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987 earnings but profits will only barely reach last year\'s record levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said.     He told the annual news conference that possible credit risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.     Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from 222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.     Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased slightly and stood around 0.7 pct.     Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.     Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.     The parent bank\'s 1986 partial operating profit, which excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed two pct to 671 mln marks.     The parent bank\'s balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5 billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.     It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.     The mortgage sector\'s share in total parent bank business volume rose to 46 pct from 45.     Hackl said that in January and February this year, the bank\'s credit business had not livened up. But despite the sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared with the same year-ago period.

'Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG BKFG.F, BfG, partial operating profits fell to 182.6 mln marks in 1986 from 313.7 mln in 1985, new majority shareholder Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG AMVG.F, AMB, said.     But total operating and extraordinary profits, including earnings from currency and securities trading on the bank\'s own account and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms, were more than double the previous year\'s level, AMB said.     BfG\'s 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB\'s capital increase, which is to finance the insurance company\'s acquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG.     Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid an unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company, Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG, from which AMB has acquired the majority stake.     The bank has said its business last year suffered from the turbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housing concern Neue Heimat.     AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG\'s business volume to 50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus.     The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from 981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in the interest margin to 1.9 pct.     A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from 188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.     The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up risk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasised because of the continuing difficulties of some countries.     Disclosed risk provisions, which under West German accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount, rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.     BfG\'s parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in 1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct of this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for 14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.     BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01 pct of Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG, 74.9 pct of BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG and five pct of Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG. The sale was linked to AMB\'s acquisition of a majority of BfG.     These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transfer agreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions.  \n',earn

'Australia\'s largest company, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd BRKN.S (BHP), is expected to report a net profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first nine months ended February 28, share analysts polled bys said.     This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the first three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31 1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.     The analysts estimated that the group would report a third quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.     BHP\'s earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted to 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.     The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait fields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and steel earnings.     They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been affected by industrial and production problems.     The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP\'s lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors, and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around 300 mln dlrs.     One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on capital expenditure in the steel division, they said.     They said they saw BHP\'s full year earnings at around 900 mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from 1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it would be difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit.  \n',earn
'The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd BRKN.S said it expects a strong full year result, helped by sigificant investment allowance credits in the fourth quarter, but net will fall short of the record 988.2 mln dlrs earned in 1985/86 ended May 31.     The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to 603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28 from 813.0 mln a year earlier.     Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November 31, BHP said in a statement.     Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of share analysts\' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs.     BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1.     The bonus is being made from reserves which will not qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of dividend imputation next July 1.     The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP said.     BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of dividend will be maintained on the increased capital.     The level of future dividends will be influenced by the implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation, it said.     As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in shareholders\' hands provided they are paid out of profits that have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate.     BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln a year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln.     BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new plant and some operational difficulties.     The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.

'British Telecommunications Plc\'s BTY.L profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old telephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said.     Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results which were released earlier today, Odgers said the company faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems in Britain for three to five years.     He said Mercury Communications Ltd, a Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor.     Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some of British Telecom\'s most profitable areas.     One company official privately estimated that British Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct.     The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, which lead to some disruption in service, could well have encouraged clients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said.     However, he forecast that the last quarter\'s results overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout.     He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at 50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities.     But on balance Odgers said that group\'s financial strength, economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth industry will help produce annual profit increases for the forseeable future.     British Telecom will also seek to expand into manufacturing, he said, adding that research and development expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover.

In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-tax profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion.

Commenting on the company\'s longer term earnings outlook, Gluck said \"we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization.\"     He said the company does not usually release projections, but has done so now beause of the significance of the recapitalization.     Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June.     The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities.     As part of the plan, the company will change its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.     The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide for, among other things, a \"fair price\" provision requiring that certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares held by such interested stockholders.     Caesars World said in a statement that \"the cash distribution will result in a substantial deficit in stockholders\' equity.\" It did not give an estimate of the size of this deficit.     But the company said its financial advisors have said they believe that after the recapitalization, Caesars World should have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to finance its current and projected operating and capital requirements.  \n',earn
'Canada\'s major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing if, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said.     American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing.     Such action \"would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian banks to do the same,\" Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank analyst Donna Pulcine tolds.     \"They (banks) like to appear to be conservative,\" said Pulcine, \"and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing basis and the Canadian banks don\'t, there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non-performing and another bank is not.\"     Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp CCI to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks.     \"In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) have to have the support of the other banks,\" said Meredith.     Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd said at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify, \"wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position.\"     Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs by Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.     Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days. They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until late May, which falls in Canadian banks\' third quarter ending July 31.     Bank of Montreal, Brazil\'s largest Canadian bank creditor, said last week it was not currently considering declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as non-performing.     \"I think that is just for the benefit of the public,\" Walsh said of Bank of Montreal\'s statement.      Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans non-performing.     They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks\' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income.     \"From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks will get the money,\" said Meredith. \"My outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year\'s earnings.\"     Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of 3.80 dlrs for Royal Bank of Canada compared with 3.74 in 1986; 4.30 dlrs for Bank of Montreal compared with 3.59; 2.25 dlrs for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce compared with 2.23;  2.15 dlrs for Bank of Nova Scotia compared with 1.94, and 2.85 dlrs for Toronto Dominion Bank against 2.74.     She forecast 1.90 dlrs for National Bank of Canada against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split.     Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share, assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil\'s interest costs.     \"If the banks didn\'t receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a share. But I don\'t see that as a likely scenario,\" Pulcine said.     Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the Brazilian debt situation was so complex that \"it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year.\"     He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil\'s yearly interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings.  \n',earn
'Canada\'s airline industry, shaken up by a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said.     \"Now we\'ve got a company that can compete with Air Canada,\" said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. \"Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market.\"     The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week as Canadian Airlines International Ltd.     Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the 6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada\'s 50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine pct.     Analysts believe Pacific Western\'s aggressive and cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd.     They said CP Air\'s management style had been not much different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because neither airline was held accountable to its owners.     \"Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line,\" said Bradley.     \"But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air Canada is on the verge of going that way,\" he said.     CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than profits, was \"a perennial money-loser,\" analyst Wilfred Hahn of Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report.     Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.     Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more than 2 billion dlrs.     Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more attention to finances, analysts said.     It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit \"in excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs\" for 1986. However, this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.     Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year, attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.     For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from cost-cutting and careful spending.     Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain.     \"The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody else\'s,\" Friend said.     Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline shares for at least a year.     Analysts said Air Canada\'s immediate concern ahead of a public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes without setting off a political storm.     It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.     Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later, already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of a dozen aircraft from Europe\'s Airbus Industrie.     Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the Boeing Co.     Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet, needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without hurting profits.     Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian Airlines\' profit in 1988 will more than double last year\'s 29.8 mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western.  \n',earn
'Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter ended January 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than last year\'s 697.0 mln dlrs.     However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of provisioning for loan losses established last year because of many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31.     The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5 mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.     Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in calculating first quarter results.     The bank\'s first quarter provision for loan losses rose to 172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.     Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal government\'s Inspector General of Banks.     First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs.     Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to 213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions, non-interest expenses and income taxes.     The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92 billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.     Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100 dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986, but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.     The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4 billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from fiscal 1986 year-end.     \"Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank\'s loans to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987, and there was little adverse impact on the bank\'s earnings prior to the announcement,\" Commerce bank said.     The bank did not disclose a forecast of the impact on future earnings by Brazil\'s suspension of interest payments.  \n',earn
'Canadian Pacific Ltd said fourth quarter 1986 operating profit rose to 91.6 mln dlrs, or 30 cts a share, from 50.7 mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, a year ago.     The statement confirmed released preliminary earnings figures the company released in February.     A 102.6 mln dlr gain on the sale of CP\'s Cominco Ltd interest helped raise final 1986 fourth quarter profit to 193.8 mln dlrs or 65 cts a share.     The company said a drop in 1986 full-year operating profit to 150.1 mln dlrs from a restated 252.7 mln dlrs in 1985 was due mainly to lower world oil prices.     The company said its CP Rail division reported 1986 net income of 119.4 mln dlrs, compared with 133.4 mln dlrs in 1985. It said grain traffic recovered from drought-affected levels of a year ago but was offset by weakness in other traffic areas and increased expenses.     It said the net loss from its Soo Line increased to 33.5 mln dlrs loss from 8.7 mln dlrs loss in 1985, mainly due to restructuring charges.     Canadian Pacific said favorable developments during the year included reduced bulk shipping losses as a result of a recovery in tanker markets and a turnaround in the forest products sector.  \n',earn

After an extraordinary expense associated with the December, 1986 withdrawal of a planned common share offering, \"we expect to be modestly profitable for the year, but below the 410,000 dlrs earned in fiscal 1986,\" the company said.

'Buoyed by low fuel prices and favourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd\'s CAPH.HK 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline\'s forecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said.     Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings of between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports results tomorrow for its first year as a public company.     Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd SWPC.HK, made its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in May last year.     Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making a total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the prospectus, analysts polled bys said.     They said the airline\'s performance improved in the second half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln dlrs.     The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one U.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company\'s favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time of the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said.     James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline industry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the 1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would affect Cathay\'s net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits of 1.25 billion dlrs.      Analysts said the company\'s estimates of fuel price and currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative.     \"This is reflected in their interim results which showed that profit margin has increased,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.     Cathay\'s six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier levels, but profits rose 69 pct.     The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on the company\'s fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices usually lag behind crude price movements by several months, analysts said.     By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and sterling 12 pct.     \"Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against Cathay\'s major trading currencies helped push passenger yields in the first half up 7.2 pct,\" said James Capel. \"This should continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to end the year up 7.6 pct.\"     A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash under management also improved profits, James Capel said.     A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed to Cathay\'s revenue increase, but the company\'s load factor declined because of increased competition and an expansion of its fleet and services.     James Capel estimated Cathay\'s passenger-kilometres flown last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown climbed 17 pct, though the airline\'s load factor probably fell to 68.8 pct from 70 pct.     \"Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,\" said Tsang. \"This affected its load factor.\"     Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier Hong Kong Dragon Airways Ltd may have contributed to Cathay\'s decision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analysts said.  \n',earn
'Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd CAPH.HK forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over the year-earlier period.

It earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 1.23 billion H.K. Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14 cents a share.     But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance charges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year.     A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraft deliveries in 1986.     However, the company said in a statement good returns from funds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher interest costs resulting from additional lease financing and other borrowing.     It added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuel prices fall to an average 4.59 dlrs a gallon from 6.76 dlrs in 1985.

'China\'s first joint venture bank, Xiamen International Bank (XIB), reported a group net profit of about 14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the bank\'s first full year of operation.     General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit forecast, saying targets were under study.     Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group\'s outstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs, up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowings rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he tolds.     Liu said most of the group\'s profit came from the parent company rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries Xiamen International Finance Co Ltd in Hong Kong and Luso International Bank Ltd in Macao.     The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985 but did not officially open until March 1986.     Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign partner, Hong Kong-listed Panin Holdings Ltd, had been cut last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign banks felt the XIB\'s reputation would be improved if the three Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.     Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were unfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a loss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of 268,000 dlrs in 1985.     The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15, Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10).     One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on unequal terms with state-owned banks.     The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost saturated, he added.     Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted from contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank.

This weekend he said that those profit estimates \"remain about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic.\"     Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the AX, launched on the French market last October. It will be available throughout most of western Europe within four months.     The car has registered just over 20,000 sales.     It is being built at Citroen\'s large plant at Aulnay-sous- Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and Vigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of 1,000 cars a day.     The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model between its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to compete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa.     The AX had built up its market share in France to around four pct last month. Calvet said: \"Our hope is that once the AX is fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent of the national market.\"  \n',earn

'Comalco Ltd said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.     It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.     Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final dividend, delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws.     This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985.

'Commerzbank AG CBKG.F said a dividend of nine marks would be proposed for ordinary shareholders on 1986 earnings after eight in 1985.     It added in a statement that parent net profit rose to 288.2 mln marks in 1986 from 221.7 mln the prior year.     A Commerzbank spokesman noted the figures were,however, preliminary and required approval of the bank\'s supervisory board which meets today.     The Commerzbank statement added the distributable profit last year rose to 228.2 mln marks from 161.7 mln in 1985.     With inclusion of the corporate tax allowance, qualifying domestic shareholders would receive an effective dividend of 14.06 marks per share.     Total dividend payout would rise to 186.8 mln marks from 142.0 mln on 1985 earnings due to the increase in the dividend and in equity capital, it added.     From the parent net profit, 60 mln marks would be placed in published reserves, unchanged from the two prior years.     The shareholders\' meeting take place on May 22 in Hamburg.     The statement said holders of Commerzbank participation certificates in a total nominal value of 425 mln marks would receive the remaining 41.4 mln marks of the distributable profit.

'Commerzbank AG CBKG.F management board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be lower than in 1986.     In the first two months of the year, partial operating profit -- excluding trading on the bank\'s own account - declined, he said, without giving details.     The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of 1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly. By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased.     German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp said last year the figure for the first time had topped one billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was around 50 pct higher than this.     Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, \"we were able to raise the full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of 1985 because own account profits increased slightly.\"     He gave no concrete details but added that in January and February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure.     The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in future, developing, for example, more into investment banking, keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets.     Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had been a strong growth in business volume.     Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2 billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added.     Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15 billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relationships had remained unchanged.     In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985\'s 2.56 pct despite pressure on credit rates.     The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said.     Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct to more than 650 mln.     As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks.     Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year from 233 mln in 1985.     Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a \"high two-figure million\" in profit from the sale of the bank\'s AEG AG AEGG.F shares to Daimler-Benz AG DAIG.F during the latter\'s majority stake purchase booked last year.     The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior years, to its full extent.     Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further.     Seipp said that because about half the group\'s exposure to problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks.     \"This means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default,\" he added.     Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems.     All banks had significantly strengthened their capital base, most European banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties.     He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new approach to indebted nations\' problems. There was a lot of interest in direct investment via an equity participation in Latin America, particularly from West German firms.  \n',earn

'(Consolidated-Bathurst Inc) said it expects improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in the second half of 1986 to continue this year. The continued improvement would be due to good market demand, better product prices and high operating capacity, the company said in its annual report.     Consolidated-Bathurst, which reported operating profit of 104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said its joint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar, B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contribute to equity earnings.     Last year\'s results were up from 1985 operating profit of 80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs.     The company said it views its near-term prospects with improved optimism.     It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in the U.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacity and production and more favorable market conditions.     It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987 for its Diamond-Bathurst Inc (DBH) subsidiary, which lost 6.2 mln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year, and expects higher sales and earnings for its other North American packaging divisions.     Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its Europa Carton unit is mixed.

'Continental Illinois Corp\'s CIL Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule Brazil\'s debt payments taking at least three to six months.     Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks are under way.     \"I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer, for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil\'s debt,\" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.     \"I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just how long the run is is anybody\'s guess,\" Swearingen said.     Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil\'s moritorium may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.     The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago, Continental\'s largest subsidiary, said in response to an inquiry.     Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.     Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for 1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses. Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.     In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.     The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC, during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the 1984 restructuring agreement with the government.     The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987, Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.     In 1986 the bank\'s loans to the Midwest\'s middle market rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.     Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it bought three small suburban banks.     Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.     He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who will eventually own the firm because it still holds the equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.     The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984 bailout of the bank.     Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not comment on a successor.     The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country doesn\'t need external sources of cash.  \n',earn

'CRA Ltd CRAA.S said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1, making 13 cents for&#127;the year against 15 in 1985.     The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against analysts\' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to&#127;160 mln.     CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been p&#127;id.     The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.     Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout, it said.     Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of gold producers.     Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.     Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.     World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance, but overcapacity continues, CRA said.     Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd BUVA.S contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd\'s CMAC.S net was 37.8 mln.     Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.     Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985, CRA said.     Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln.     CRA\'s share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.     CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.     Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions, CRA said.     Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.     CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985 mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0 mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost.  \n',earn
'Creditanstalt-Bankverein CABV.VI is likely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12 pct of share capital, deputy general-director Guido Schmidt-Chiari said.     The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank\'s share capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986 from 2.7 billion a year earlier.     Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.     Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.     The banking group\'s consolidated balance sheet total rose to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion.     General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last year\'s better profits had resulted from improvements in services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling lending.     Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when compared with those in other countries, he said.     Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits, Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure.     Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations, removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet total.     In an attempt to generate more foreign business, representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and drawing dividends.     Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers said improved results had been widely expected by investors.     Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in 1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of 2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria\'s largest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and large Austrian companies.

'Deutsche Bank AG DBKG.F has seen a slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986, management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said.     Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference.     Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78 billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion.     Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank\'s own account, not included in partial operating profits.     Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest surplus in a section current earnings from securities and participations.     In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from 1.45 billion.     As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits.     But it said that total operating profits, including own account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the parent bank.     Banking analysts said this put group total operating profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank operating profits at over five billion marks.     Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its unchanged 12 mark dividend.     The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986, and developments so far this year showed that was correct, Christians said.     West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits.     The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a high level of risk provision, Christians said.     Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in 1986 from 765 mln in 1985.     Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily reflect the full amount of risk provisions.     Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said Deutsche\'s total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985 because of the fall in the dollar.     He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of such problem country debt had been written off.     Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of \"other securities,\" to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the parent bank.     Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due to its increased activity in international share placements, with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA\'s international placement last year remaining on its books.     Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to place these shares and conclude the original placement.  \n',earn

Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to 25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mln a year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30 mln from 44.29 mln.     Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on fringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, the company said in a statement.     Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue growth in the television industry as another reason for the flat first half earnings.     It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of these factors.     Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, as did the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremely satisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly.     But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0 pct rise in revenue, it said.     Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the receipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from Australian Associated Press Pty Ltd (AAP) after the sale of AAP\'s \"B\" shares ins Holdings Plc RTRS.L.     This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit.     Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the full year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr acquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbourne will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.  \n',earn

'West Germany\'s chemical industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987 turnover will stabilize around 1986\'s 140 billion marks, Josef Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said.     Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG BAYG.F, told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as well as crude oil and commodity prices.     Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.     The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.     Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price competition and increased costs.     Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years, neutralized the negative impact.     Strenger said the industry would try to increase production in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of West Germany.     The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and 22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.     Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.     Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late last year.  \n',earn

'Gulf States Utilities Co said its condition has \"significantly deteriorated\" and that its operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless it receives additional financing or rate relief from state public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana.     In the company\'s newly-released annual report and 10-K filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the utility last month that no additional credit would be granted. Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs.     \"The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company may have to seek protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy code,\" Gulf States said.     The utility had previously said it might be forced to consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf States\' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.     \"If the regulatory commissions approve the company\'s proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period, the company believes it could achieve financial stability,\" Gulf States said.     In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1 mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas.     Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in emergency rate relief.

'The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp HKBH.HK is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and 13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth, share analysts polled bys said.     Their estimates of the bank\'s net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.     They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue.     Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year, probably one for three or one for five.     The bank\'s 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd HSGH.HK is to report its 1986 results on Friday.     Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to 12 pct.     They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.     Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise, Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.     \"They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand, as their loan portfolio is well balanced,\" an analyst at Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.     Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.     Loans to finance Hong Kong\'s visible trade, the mainstay of the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985.     Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986, but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.     The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.     \"The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks,\" one analyst said.     The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd WAIA.HK and James Capel and Co, analysts said. \"Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter,\" an analyst said.     Wardley was underwriter for last year\'s billion-dlr flotation of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time.     The bank\'s stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake in South China Morning Post Ltd, the larger of two English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.     The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.     Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced need to write off bad debts. \"The need for provisions was much lower than the year before,\" said Tony Measor of Hong Leong Securities Co Ltd. \"Last year\'s profits should have been 2.8 to 2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions.\"     Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.     The bank\'s Latin American exposure, mainly through its 51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc MM, appears to have improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland\'s 1986 fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145 mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.  \n',earn

'Hoechst AG HFAG.F said in a statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.     The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.     World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in 1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01 billion from 42.72 billion.     Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.     The statement made no mention of net profit figures. Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.     In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from 1986, Hoechst said.     Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.     Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to American Hoechst Corp.     Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.     Roussel Uclaf RUCF.PA and most domestic non-consolidated partners did not perform as well as in 1985.     Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in extraordinary costs.     The fall in raw material prices was not enough to compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and currencies, Hoechst said.     The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new projects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the acquisition of Celanese Corp.     Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to form Hoechst Celanese Corp.  \n',earn

'Hutchison Whampoa Ltd HWHH.HK expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said.     He did not make any specific projections for the company\'s earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.     It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year, equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share split.     Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.     The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper, compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining shares.     Li said Hong Kong\'s property market remains strong while its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth.     Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.     But he said Hong Kong\'s large trade deficit with the U.S. May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the British colony.     He said all of the company\'s major operations showed improved results in 1986.     Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd HKEH.HK to Cavendish International Holdings Ltd, itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric.     Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share.     Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.     The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.     Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from the government for the spin-off.     He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.

'Jacobs Suchard AG JACZ.Z hopes for another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986 net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said.     The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs.     Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the company\'s target of five pct real annual growth, had been made possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986 which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year.     Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24 billion francs was due to currency factors.     A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset by growth in operations and by structural changes within the group.     Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.     Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25 pct against 25.3 pct.     Pohl said the group\'s average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further increase in tax levels was expected in future.     Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln the previous year.  \n',earn
'Jaguar Plc JAGR.L is about to sell its new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference.     Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly below 1985\'s 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of the new model had kept this year\'s pre-tax profit down.     Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.     U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover, finance director John Edwards said.     A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an \"umbrella\" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car\'s price.     Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.     In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct.     Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg, but Egan said this would take at least another three years     On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar\'s shares were last quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday\'s close, after reporting 1986 results which were in line with market expectations, dealers said. ... \n',earn
'The extended decline in Japan\'s overall business performance was likely to bottom out in the current January-March quarter, the Finance Ministry said.     Improved corporate earnings and better prospects for the stability of the yen had made companies more optimistic, it said after carrying out a quarterly survey.     The survey, conducted in February, was based on questionnaires returned by 8,328 large and small firms in all sectors except the finance and insurance industries.     The survey said overall corporate earnings were expected to turn positive with an estimated 0.4 pct year on year increase in the second half of fiscal 1986 ending on March 31 after a 5.4 pct decrease in the first half.     Corporate earnings will grow further in the first half of fiscal 1987, rising an estimated 10.7 pct, it added.     Manufacturers\' earnings, hit hard by the yen\'s steady rise against the dollar, will rise 7.7 pct in first-half fiscal 1987 after falling 10.7 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, it said.     Overall earnings of non-manufacturing companies will rise 11.8 pct year on year in the first half of fiscal 1987 after growing 9.8 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, the survey said.     It said this figure was bolstered by profits of firms such as electric power and gas companies which have benefitted from the yen\'s appreciation.  \n',earn
'Current profits of Japan\'s major firms in the October-December quarter rose four pct from a year earlier to 5,654 billion yen against a 2.6 pct year-on-year rise in the preceding quarter, the Finance Ministry said.     The improved earnings resulted mainly from a 22.5 pct profit increase in non-manufacturing industries, supported by an 88.7 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain in real estate, according to a ministry survey.     Total sales of the 15,308 firms with capital of 10 mln yen or more which responded to the poll, fell one pct to 217,217 billion yen against a 1.2 pct fall the previous quarter.

'Japanese corporate earnings will rise 8.9 pct in fiscal 1987/88 for the first year-on-year increase in three years, partly because of the yen\'s stable exchange rate, the Nomura research institute said.

Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in the current fiscal year with sales forecast to drop 14 pct.     The forecast assumes an average rate of 148.5 yen to the dollar in 1987/88, compared with 160 yen in the current year.     Corporate efforts to cope with the yen\'s appreciation, such as cutting production costs, are expected to bear fruit next fiscal year, the institute said. The economy should also benefit from pump-priming expected from the government and a halt in rising prices of manufactured goods, it said.     Recurrent profits of manufacturing industries are projected to rise 29.6 pct next fiscal year against an estimated 40.1 pct fall in the current year.

'Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd JARD.HKG said it planned a bonus issue of four new \"B\" shares of 20 H.K. Cents each for every ordinary share of par value two dlrs.     A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total 1987 dividend of four cents per \"B\" share, while the \"A\" share dividend will be maintained at last year\'s level of 40 cents a share.     Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986 net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985.     Shareholders\' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from 4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said.     It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd HKLD.HKG, Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan.     He said the group\'s stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a reorganisation, is \"a long term investment and now stands at a level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset imbalance.\"     Keswick said the issue of new \"B\" shares will give the group \"the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which has been brought about through the group\'s recent restructuring.\"     He said the new issue is pending approval from both the firm\'s shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.     The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation, with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to the new unit Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd.     Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two companies spun off from Hk Land -- Mandarin Oriental International Ltd and Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd -- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson.     Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrs last year, will become debt free after the restructuring.     \"A positive cash flow from operations and disposals, continuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet,\" Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests in airfreight operations, Australian properties and trucking business, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities.     Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its general trading business in the Middle East in view of the continuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he said the operations would be profitable in the longer term.     He said the firm\'s function \"has evolved into one primarily of strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy.\"     He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the board of directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacific regional board. He gave no further details of the change.     Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs at midday on the Hong Kong stock market. In early trading it had fallen to 24.30 dlrs because of rumours yesterday that the firm planned a rights issue.  \n',earn
'A strong performance by its retail businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd JARD.HKG to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in 1986, stock analysts said.     They tolds they expect the firm to show earnings of between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln in 1985.     The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a share in 1985.     James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson\'s 1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income to retail sales.     Analysts said the group\'s 7-Eleven retail stores and its franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.     Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine Matheson\'s 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465 mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.     But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson\'s earnings from its 35 pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd HKLD.HKG will fall to about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.     The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong Kong Land of Dairy Farm International Ltd last September.     Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the year as part of its retail business, which will increase its overall retail income figures.     Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct share of Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd.     Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986 of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.     Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln dlrs of 1985, while the company\'s term debt remained at about the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.     But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.     Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its diverse interests.     It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd in which it has a 41 pct interest.     A company statement issued last month said the firm will use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.     Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is likely to develop its own business, analysts said.     \"The future of the stock will depend on the firm\'s ability to creatively structure some new acquisitions,\" said Hargreaves of Hoare Govett.     He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its existing business.  \n',earn

'Kloeckner &amp; Co KGaA, the international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.     The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.     It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary because of recent declines in raw material prices.     Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in prices as well as the lower value of the dollar.     It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held largely by family foundations.     Kloeckner\'s nominal 100 mark profit-participation certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield of around 10 pct.

'The Fried.

Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5 billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from 16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.     Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar\'s weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.     The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.     Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had underpinned machinery and component activities.     An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the trading and services sectors, affected the group\'s total order figures.     However, \"all business sectors contributed to the positive results achieved in 1986,\" Krupp added, without giving details.     Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9 billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of orders against 40 pct in 1985.

Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.     The steel market weakened increasingly over the year, mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer industries.

'Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG [OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard Wagner said.     Wagner told a news conference that last year\'s 34.3 pct rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling interest rates.     The bank, Austria\'s third largest, raised its 1986 dividend to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.     Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: \"We will endeavour to maintain the higher dividend in 1987.\"     Laenderbank\'s balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7 billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.     Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business chiefly on the dollar\'s fall against the schilling, which is effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar\'s weakness had wiped some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.     Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from the bank\'s London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said that it came close to one mln stg.     On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed 8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.     According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct. Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.  \n',earn

Managers responded well to the demand for lower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide.

'Engineering group Linde AG\'s LING.F world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks in the first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same 1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said.     But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and incoming orders increased 1.0 pct.     Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group 1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln.     Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to 394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln.     Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13 to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde\'s authorised share capital currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks.     Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for acquisitions. He declined to give further details.     While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91 billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming orders would have been four pct above the prior year\'s level.     World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4 pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to 739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge.     World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05 billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05 billion marks.     Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in the refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and order gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks.     The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group sales rising 12.4 pct to 1.52 billion marks and incoming orders gaining 8.0 pct to 1.57 billion marks.

'Shell U.K. Ltd\'s pre-tax profit on exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in 1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices last year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.     But he told a press conference that due to the high marginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact of the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330 mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.     The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, with Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, he said.     As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration and production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.     Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group RD.AS, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg, up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against 8.81 mln.     Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company\'s crude oil output from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986, which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the company. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the current year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline in output from the major Brent field, he said.     Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to be maintained in 1987, he said.     A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months, Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5 billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil price fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.     Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North Sea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.     Day to day operating costs of the exploration and production sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target is to keep costs per barrel constant.     The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to the discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.     Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.     Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit Shell U.K. Oil, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987 were a \"bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.\"     In November and December in particular, refining operations had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil product prices, he said. He expected margins to continue generally positive over the summer, although they could dip to become negative from time to time, depending on price movements.     A new catalytic cracker at Shell\'s Stanlow refinery will now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five months behind schedule, following a crane accident which severely damaged the plant last year, he said.     Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from 11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical site.     Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against PRT, was \"helpful,\" but rather less than had been hoped for.     Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in the range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he would expect some over-production above OPEC\"s official 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.     He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain output was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance, but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will fall.  \n',earn
'Lucas Industries Plc LUCS.L said its underlying performance would continue to improve in the second half but profits would be restrained by low activity in U.K. Commercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in North American electronics.

The figure was some five mln below forecasts and Lucas shares dropped sharply to 557.5p at 1130 GMT from last night\'s close of 590p.

'Consolidated attributable net profit of Ste Lyonnaise des Eaux LYOE.PA is likely to rise by at least 10 pct this year from the 360 mln francs reported for 1986, Chairman Jerome Monod told a news conference.     Group turnover should rise about seven pct from the 15.7 mln reported for this year, while group investments should total around 1.8 billion francs, somewhat above the 1.3 billion annual average of the past three years, he added.     Investments will be aimed mainly at developing the group\'s leisure industry, health and communications activities, Monod said.     In the leisure sector the group planned a joint development with Club Mediterranee CMI.PA, Club Med, of a 200 hectare pleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of Eastern Central France, he said.     Wholly-owned subsidiary Lyonnaise de Developpement Touristique would carry out the construction work and financial planning of the development which would be leased to Club Med as operator of the complex, he said.     He gave no financial details but said leisure sector investments would total about 100 mln francs over the next three years.     Investments in the communications industry would go mainly to develop the group\'s cable television activities and its 25 pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recently won the concession to operate a sixth television channel in France.     Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mln francs over the next four years, of which Lyonaise des Eaux would provide about 175 mln, Monod said.     Monod said Metropole aimed to win a 15 to 20 pct audience share and to capture about 10 pct of the national television advertising market.     Total investment by the group in the communications sector, including cable activities, would be between 300 mln and 400 mln francs over the next five years, mainly concentrated in the coming year.     Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mln and 200 mln over the five years, with the aim of widening the audience to 280,000 subscribers from 12,000, and boosting turnover to around 450 mln francs a year from 10 mln.  \n',earn
'Mannesmann AG MMWG.F expects a difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief executive Werner Dieter told a news conference.     Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer nations.     Domestic business was also declining and orders for West German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986, Dieter said.     Mannesmann\'s profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.     Dieter said Mannesmann\'s pipe activities would suffer a set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started last year, were now having an effect.     Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann\'s turnover. The company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter said had become one of Mannesmann\'s \"strategic aims.\"     He said the company\'s drive to combine activities in mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular \"plus point\" for Mannesmann.     Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.     It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar and lack of demand for steel pipe.

'Morgan Grenfell Group Plc said its 1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc GUIN.L shares and because of securities trading losses in the U.S.     Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group\'s seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some eight mln stg to 82.2 mln.     He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal approaches about a takeover of the group but was not interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not elaborate.     Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during the brewing company\'s successful bid for Distillers Co Plc DIST.L in the first half of last year.     The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price during the bid.     Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness affair.     Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier, resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider information. He currently faces criminal charges.     Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been \"one of the most traumatic in our history,\" but that clients and staff had been supportive.     \"I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet.\"     Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from corporate finance activities and progress in asset management.

'Norcen Energy Resources Ltd, 41 pct owned by Hees International Corp, said earnings and cash flow will improve in 1987, even if oil and gas prices remain at 1986 levels.     The improvement will result from production increases, lower taxes and royalties, reduced financing costs and from operating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during 1986, the company said in the annual report.     Norcen previously reported 1986 earnings, excluding a 20.1 mln dlr writeoff, declined by 58 pct to 50.0 mln dlrs from 119.7 mln dlrs in in 1985.     Norcen\'s 1986 cash flow fell 10 pct to 204.9 mln dlrs from 228.9 mln dlrs in the prior year.     It said the sharp decline in oil prices during 1986 was the most significant factor for Norcen\'s reduced performance.     \"While financial results are far from the previous year\'s record levels, it is clear that Norcen has withstood declining prices and remains financially and operationally strong,\" Norcen said. It did not give a specific 1987 profit forecast.

'Financial and industrial holding company Nord Est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of 400 mln francs, President Gustave Rambaud said.     He told a news conference Nord-Est expected to receive approval from the Bourse supervisory body COB in the next two week, when terms would set according to market conditions.     He said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new investments.     Rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25 francs, unchanged on 1985. Parent company net profit last year rose to 99.5 mln francs against 71.1 mln in 1985.     Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln francs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against 147 mln, was attributable to the group. He said the lower profit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker Vallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake.     Rambaud said he forecast a 1987 parent company net profit before provisions of around 135 mln francs.  \n',earn

'The state oil company Petroeleos de Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said.     Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly, Hernandez said PDVSA\'s income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last year\'s 13.3 billion.     Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said \"had a very serious impact on Venezuela.\"     PDVSA\'s export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined products.     The figure surpassed PDVSA\'s stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year.     The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank. Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA\'s overseas refining and marketing operations.     Consumption in Venezuela\'s internal market increased from 323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However, Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd.     Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of Venezuela\'s reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country\'s production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.      Venezuela\'s total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986 were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the world, Hernandez said.  \n',earn

Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.     A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed on currency movements.     Last year\'s results were also badly hit by a once-off writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.     The company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over.     The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.     Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it having used more funds than generated by group operations, mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular Inc.  \n',earn
'Sports carmaker Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG PSHG.F said it expects to post a satisfactory profit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower but U.S. Sales anticipated higher.     Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic sales were expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from 11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000 from 28,670 last year.     Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Last month the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70 mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86.     For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume this year to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254, Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit were based on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, he added.     The expected drop in West German sales this year would be the result of the so-called \"grey market\" for Porsche cars, he said. When the dollar was strong against the mark, many Porsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegal export to the U.S.     Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87 first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period.     The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a larger percentage of overall sales this year than before does not pose problems for profit, the Porsche board said.     In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around 20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same time Porsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the 1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki.

'A spokesman for Preussag AG PRSG.F said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay a dividend on 1986 results     He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following a difficult year in 1985.     Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.     The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the group\'s other divisions.     The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions.     Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.     The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before. Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.     The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.     The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results.     Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year.     Preussag\'s domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.     Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison figures.     Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0 pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.     Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC) subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year.     AMC\'s large losses in 1985, caused principally by the international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world group losses that year.  \n',earn

'State-owned engine maker Rolls Royce Plc launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is likely to miss contracts to power the proposed Airbus Industrie A340 aircraft.     The company\'s so-called \"pathfinder prospectus\" gives all the details of its stock market flotation except for the price at which shares will be offered.     Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before.     Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit for 1987.     Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings.     Assuming the company was valued at around eight times earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about 1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards.     BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion.     The price will be increased by it being likely to have much of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the company\'s health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.     When the government announced the sale, it said it would inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250 mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.     Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit rating to match those of its main competitors such as General Electric Co GE.N and United Technologies Corp\'s UTX.N Pratt and Whitney unit.  \n',earn

A spokesman said no specific figures had been forecast.     Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide, including further moves in the speciality retailing business which Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said.     Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast by chairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performance of seven businesses bought last year was encouraging.     The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share and increased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concern increased profit and Rowntree\'s small health food business, Holgates, raised earnings 10-fold, the statement said.     Offsetting factors included currency movements, which cost the company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profits on confectionery operations, and the company faced strong competition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets.  \n',earn
'Royal Bank of Canada, in reporting a 19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to report improved results in future earnings periods.     \"Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income, highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the periods ahead,\" chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.     The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year ago.     Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank\'s international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.     The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103 mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs from 42 mln dlrs last year.     Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.     Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.     The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to 98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.  \n',earn
'Royal Trustco Ltd, in a move unique among Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its yearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said.     First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst Michael Walsh said Royal Trust\'s international growth target is attainable. But it \"will be a tremendous achievement because ... they\'re going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies,\" Walsh said.     Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust\'s 154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company profit, Cornelissen tolds in an interview.     He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26 pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.     Royal Trust, Canada\'s second largest trust company with assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank.     Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.     The company\'s overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980, Cornelissen said.     Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical Co DOW\'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset management, merchant and private banking companies.     \"It was a heaven-sent opportunity,\" Cornelissen said of the Dow Financial acquisition. \"We achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up.\"     Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage, in order to exploit \"profitable niches\" overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management, private banking and advisory services.     He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations \"before the end of this month\" to sell its London-based Savory Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal.     \"The international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business,\" he said, adding that in trust-type services, \"we don\'t think the international markets are well-served.\"     Aiding Royal Trust\'s foreign growth are greater foreign  investment interest in North America and increased Canadian investment abroad, Cornelissen said.     Central to Royal Trust\'s strategy is Asia, boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust.     Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia will contain two-thirds of the world\'s population and 50 pct of global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, \"We knew we had to be there.\" Royal Trust\'s 14 international locations include offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.     The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the \"immediate future,\" although \"we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities.\"     Asked about Royal Trust\'s plans for the U.S., which the company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units, Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks.     \"That doesn\'t mean to say we shouldn\'t be in the U.S.,\" said Cornelissen. \"That is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years.\"     He said the company would continue to emphasize its home Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.     Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks, trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in one another\'s actitivies will mean more domestic competition for Royal Trust, \"but not drastically more,\" Cornelissen said.  \n',earn
'Rugby Portland Cement Plc RBYL.L said it was well placed to operate in the new circumstances following the ending in February of the 53-year old cement manufacturers common price and marketing arrangements.     In a statement following the release of its 1986 results, IT stated that the current year had started well. It reported that pretax profits in the year rose to 35.46 mln stg from 21.84 mln previously on turnover higher at 313.3 mln after 252.2 mln.     The strong recovery of the first six months continued into the second half, although U.K. Cement demand rose only modestly. Results benefitted from cost cutting and higher volumes.     The decision by the Cement Makers Federation to end the pricing agreement reflected pressure from higher competition due to growing imports and the possibility that the system would be taken to the Restrictive Practices Court by the U.K. Government. It stated that its John Carr unit benefitted from strong organic growth, although overseas its Cockburn operation had a difficult period with high maintenance costs and increased depreciation charges.     The company is proposing to change its name at the next annual meeting to Rugby Group Plc.     Rugby said it spent 27 mln stg on acquisitions in 1986. It noted that its Western Australia hotels company had agreed to sell the Parmelia hotel for 31.5 mln Australian dlrs, some seven mln stg above end-1986 book value.     The results were largely in line with forecasts and Rugby shares were little changed at 242p after 241 at Friday\'s close.  \n',earn
'Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer, Santos Ltd STOS.S, said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).     The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985.     Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate.     Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.     It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders\' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.     Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company TMOC Resources Ltd -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs.     Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.     Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program, finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year.     Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.     Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.     But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.     \"It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australia\'s oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,\" Massy-Green said.  \n',earn
'The Sanwa Bank Ltd\'s three-year business plan foresees securities and international operations making a greater contribution to operating profits, a bank official said.     The bank\'s plan also emphasises retail and medium and small-sized business operations, he tolds.     Officials at Fuji Bank Ltd and Mitsubishi Bank Ltd outlined similar three-year plans.     They said lower interest rates and financial liberalisation have cut profits from dealings with big firms to nearly nothing.     \"They don\'t need us, they can do their own financing,\" one official said.

'Saudi Arabia\'s 11 commercial banks are reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non- performing loans.     Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year.     But the kingdom\'s still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable.     One senior bank credit officer said \"The work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions, but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money.\"     The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia\'s corporate sector in 1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad decline.     The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom\'s banks had sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world oil prices tumbled.     Of the kingdom\'s nine joint-venture banks which operate on the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at the expense of increased provisions.     The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, United Saudi Commercial Bank (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln riyals, marginally less than 1985\'s shortfall of 17.0 mln.     Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to 60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985.     Other results released so far show Saudi American Bank (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7 mln riyals, while Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi, known as Saudi French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals.     Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp\'s CCI.N Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez, increased provisions sharply.     Arab National Bank\'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1 mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln riyals.     Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non- performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the Saudi economy bottoms out.     Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity, but one banker said \"The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions.\"     From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom\'s largest bank National Commercial Bank (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector, bankers calculated.     Between 1982 and 1985, Riyad Bank, NCB\'s rival as the second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine.     Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non-performing.     Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres.     Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank as the strongest earners.     Other banks such as Saudi British Bank, 40 pct owned by the British Bank of the Middle East, are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base.     Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions.     Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a Saudi bank go under and not only supported Saudi Cairo Bank after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to Saudi Investment Bank and USCB.     The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans.     And while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending, conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products.     One banker said \"Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not good.\"     Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return on their money.     In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer funds are held on current account.  \n',earn
'Sandoz AG SANZ.Z would have reported a percentage rise in net profits \"close to double figures\" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for November\'s warehouse fire, a senior company official said.     The official, who declined to be identified, tolds Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which caused severe pollution of the Rhine.     Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share.     This year began well, with the performance in January and February at least equal to the same period last year, the official said.     The company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on April 22.     Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident.     The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the \"one pct\" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire.     Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the Rhine since the accident.     However, the official said the final figure would be \"much less than that cited in earlier comments.\" He gave no further details.     In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy CIGZ.Z, which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were also hit by the falling dollar, the official said.     Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to 8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said.     Net profit at Ciba-Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billion francs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs.     The third major Swiss chemical company, F.

A 26.25 mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a very disappointing year.     \"A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a very meagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation of around 10 pct,\" he said.     Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on downstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns and the financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project.     Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrs against 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation.     \"It is just as important for Australia to maintain a financially healthy, technically advanced refining and marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and production,\" he said.     \"The Australian oil industry has the experience and the capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the government would stop putting roadblocks in our way,\" he said.     Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to upgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but further investment required an appropriate rate of return, he said.

'World group turnover of Siemens AG SIEG.F should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five months, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.     Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02 billion marks.     Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to 21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about 19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.     In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.     In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8 billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.     For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.     Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the communications and telecommunications sectors in particular should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.     But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for 1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the dollar, Kaske said.     Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the same period in the previous year.     Turnover in the first five months rose particularly strongly in the installations and automotive technology, communications and telecommunications sectors, but components and energy and automation showed a sharp decline.     Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.     Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad was balanced by the decline in the dollar.     While the installations and automotive technology sector showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and communications orders were below the level achieved in the same period of 1985/86.     Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same level.     Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to 6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.  \n',earn

'Singapore\'s major banks are diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from loans to debt instruments, banking sources said.     The banks following the trend are the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, United Overseas Bank Ltd, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation and the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd.     The shift towards securitisation has been helped by volatile financial markets which have developed hedging facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.     Loh tolds in an interview that Singapore banks see limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are switching from term lending to major growth areas such as stockbroking and fee based income, he said.     Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now moving into the new government securities market and the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.     One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity market in Singapore.     Loh said the banks\' participation in the stock market has increased business transactions and provided long term growth for the market. The banks are not competition for individual stockbroking firms because of the increased business they generate, he added.     Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because of the increasing ability of foreign and local market participants to absorb new issues.     Loh said OUB Investment management Ltd, a subsidiary of the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors seeking capital growth through a diversified international portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.     DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of the Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.     Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be forced to provide fund management services for major clients seeking better returns, he said.     Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from treasury and investment banking activities.

Overseas Union\'s profits are expected to jump to over 40 mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.

'Sony Corp SNE.T group net income is expected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31 from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen, if the yen&#127;dollar rate remains at the present level, managing director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference.     Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending March 31, as its financial year will be changed to run from April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.     Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550 billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said.     The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yen in the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct.     The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen\'s recent appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.     The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar, reducing the company\'s total sales in the three month period by 40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.     Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 units in the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, while Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000 from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000 from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from 1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one mln due to lower exports to China.     Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said. Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three months compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.     Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total production in 1990 from the present 20 pct.     Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month period is estimated at around 17 billion yen, down 33 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 400 billion, down 12 pct.     Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April 1 1987, he added. The company made 41.9 billion yen group net profit in the year ended November 31 1986, down 42.6 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 1,325 billion, down 6.7 pct.  \n',earn

'Spar Aerospace Ltd, reporting a sharply lower 1986 profit, said it anticipated solid profit and revenue growth during the next five years.     \"Looking to the longer term, Spar is confident that its continuing concentration on advanced robotics, satellite-based communications and electro-optical defense systems will lead to significant growth in revenues and earnings over the next five years,\" the company said.

Spar added that lower development costs in the communications group and a return to normal operations in gears and transmissions and aviation services \"will remove a serious drain on profits\" this year.     It attributed its reduced 1986 earnings to communications group losses resulting from continued heavy investment in new products and market development, a four-month strike at its Toronto plants and delays in receipt of authorization from customers to start work on new programs.  \n',earn
'US Sprint, the 50-50 telephone venture of GTE Corp GTE and United Telecommunications Inc UT set up last June, is optimistic despite expecting to report a net loss of about 500 mln dlrs this year.      David M. Holland, president of US Sprint\'s Dallas-based Southwest Division, tolds in an interview that he did not know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreed that for the year the company should have about the same results as last year when it lost \"about 500 mln dlrs.\"      He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrs over \"two plus years\" to set up its network.      Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mln dlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in order to lease its lines.      He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optic telephone line are now \"in the ground,\" and 7,000 miles are operable.      By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company\'s subscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (instead of leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of the second quarter.     Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses along microscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and more economical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic line the diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of information as a copper cable 20 feet in diameter.      \"By the end of the year, we will have the capacity to carry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls,\" Holland said.     He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S. long distance market, with MCI Communications Corp MCIC about 10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct.      Holland said Sprint\'s rates, which were 50 pct lower than ATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephone exchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all the companies have equal access. He said the company was cutting back its advertising by about 30 pct this year.      At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its total number of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 to last January.     \"We\'ve captured the fiber high ground, shown the importance of it,\" he said.      Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said he believed ATT \"should be given some flexibility, but should be regulated on pricing plans.\"      \"They\'re so dominant in the market place,\" he said, adding that ATT should be deregulated when \"there is true competition in the marketplace.\"      \"It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money,\" he said, adding, \"maybe two to four years out, it\'s hard to say.\"     Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint\'s two owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, such as the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure on them to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings.      \"They are two excellent partners who have stated time and time again their support of US Sprint,\" he said, adding that he was \"amazed\" at industry talk that the two companies might be arguing. \"There\'s no evidence of that,\" he said.      He said Sprint\'s progress in such areas as revenues, number of customers and construction was on track, even \"ahead in many areas.\"     Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprint currently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in 90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988.     \"We want to be in every country that ATT serves,\" he said.     He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico but was working on it.      He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint, the forerunner of US Sprint, had been broken off by the September 1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation\'s telephone network.  \n',earn
'Standard Bank Investment Corp Ltd (SPRJ.J) chairman Henri de Villiers said he could not predict profits for the bank this year because of South Africa\'s continuing political unrest.     De Villiers also warned in the annual report that \"failing prompt and decisive political action, South Africa faces a future of violent deadlock between different racial and political groupings.\"      He said South Africa\'s future economic prospects are \"clouded by political and social issues and in the absence of evidence that these are being positively addressed I am unable to offer an earnings forecast for 1987.\"     Standard Bank, 39 pct owned by Standard Chartered PLC  STCH.L, London, previously reported that 1986 net income rose by 13.8 pct to 209.0 mln rand.

'Standard Chartered Plc STCH.L, faced with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and an ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted its bad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said.     Barber said in a statement on the bank\'s 1986 results that bad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific, stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985.     Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in the specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Tax breaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while 71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision.     In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for 1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Total pre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985.     \"The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, on top of the normal level of provisioning,\" Barber said.     He said, \"the decision was also taken to build up loan loss reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for general provisions for commercial and cross border risks.\"     Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacific region made \"a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits.\"     He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses was \"well maintained, although the reported result was affected by cross border debt provisioning,\" while Californian subsidiary Union Bank \"showed continued growth.\"     \"Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned in excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued,\" he said.     Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off a takeover bid by Lloyds Bank LLOY.L last year, strengthened its capital resources during that year to just over three billion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.     Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primary capital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said.  \n',earn

'Swire Pacific Ltd SWPC.HKG expects continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees problems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said.     He told reporters:\"1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire Properties expects further good results both from properties under development for sale and from its investment property portfolio.\"     He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78 billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.     Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd CAPH.HKG.     Miles said the company will use the money to develop its business, primarily in Hong Kong.     Swire\'s stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from 70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25 pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the enlarged capital to the state-owned China International Trust and Investment Corp. Cathay last week reported its 1986 profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.     Miles said despite last year\'s rapid expansion in Cathay\'s flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.     He said Cathay\'s growth last year was the result of \"a marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with savings in fuel costs.\"     \"At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable for the rest of this year,\" he said, \"though there might be a bit of increase later this year.\'\'     Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service operations, even though the marine sector is generally depressed. \"Obviously the marine industry is not getting any better,\" he said.     The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year.     Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm but said the firm has no available land for a major housing project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong island now near completion.

'Swire Pacific Ltd SWPC.HKG is likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating profits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in its aviation and property businesses, share analysts said.     Analysts polled bys estimated after-tax profits from operations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs compared with 1.23 billion in 1985.     They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd CAPH.HKG unit last May.     Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985.     Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend for its \"A\" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985.     Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the company\'s net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits, analysts said.     The company\'s aviation division consists of its majority stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd, which is also 25 pct owned by Cathay.     Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel costs and greater traffic.     Swire\'s share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the flotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has since slipped to 50.23 pct.     Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs.     Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd, estimates Swire\'s profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs.     \"Much depends on properties,\" said Measor. \"And they did a lot better in the second half of the year.\"     Estimates of profits from the firm\'s wholly owned Swire Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985.     Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs for the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the same 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm\'s properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential development and two luxury housing projects.     Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in second-half 1986.     During the year property prices continued to rise as more people bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates, analysts said.     \"At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling at 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year ago,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.     Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not provide income until the first stage is completed next year.     The company also sold three properties and a part interest in a proposed hotel development, which should result in extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James Capel (Far East) Ltd.     Swire\'s trading and manufacturing operations are expected to earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10 mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.  \n',earn
'Swissair SWSZ.Z reported a 5.8 pct drop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that, in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut its payout to 33 francs per share from 38.     President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would at least equal last year\'s figure, but said much depended on outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate.     The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on Swissair\'s core flying business last year, against a profit of 27 mln francs the previous year, he said.     The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68 mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20 mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s.     Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276 mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation.     Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45 mln francs supplementary depreciation.     Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc.     While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc against other European currencies.     \"Income and profit generated by services to these countries shrank by a very substantial margin,\" he said. \"Exchange rate trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other airlines.\"  \n',earn

In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs.     Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total\'s refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France RAFF.PA, told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation.

But its net loss last year, taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985.     In 1986 CRD\'s sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from 20.9 mln \"due to the growth in imports by independent distributors following a relaxation of regulations,\" Guilbaud said.

'Problems in the farmbelt and oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall income for U.S. banks in a quarter century, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) said.     The nation\'s 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8 billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985\'s record 18.1 billion dlrs.     The total was still the second highest ever reported, but it was the first time income had not grown since 1961.     The figures reflected a radical split in the health of banks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.     In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, while one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.     Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDIC said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles it planned to issue.     \"I don\'t remember a time when there was such a clear distinction by geographic area,\" FDIC Chairman William Seidman told reporters.     He said that while the figures were not good, they showed the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but with regional differences in economic performance.     Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as many as failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubted the pace would continue.      On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208 billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in the number of new problem banks in all regions except the Southwest, Seidman said.     Banks\' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from a year ago.     Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDIC said.     Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil\'s moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.     He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be expected.     But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger, Seidman said.  \n',earn

'Ultramar Plc UMAR.L said that while its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point of view, several special charges adversely affected results.     Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstream operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and downstream operations also affected in the first half by large losses on inventories.     But margins improved in the second half and in particular refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good recovery.     The company was commenting on results that showed a net loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in 1985.     The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company\'s liquid natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership of Gulf Canada\'s marketing assets.     Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a 13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its U.S. Flag shipping operation.     The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic prices would strengthen over the longer term.     Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.     In the meantime, Ultramar\'s objectives were to improve profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while strengthening core businesses and developing a sound operational and financial base.     Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis.

'Unilever Plc UN.A and NV group reported improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said.     He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years.     Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he noted.     But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic acquisitions taking place \"from time to time,\" he said.     The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.     Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond\'s Inc CBM.N for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution.     However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the company\'s operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.     Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987.     The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with Unilever NV\'s rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc\'s increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with the change in attributable profit.     Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said that there was no target date for completing the process.     He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which operates outside Unilever\'s core activities.     In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business, considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.     However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs of its Surf detergents.  \n',earn

Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period, making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year.     Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at January 1, 1987.

The company said that its 1986 performance was best reflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln from 221 mln in 1985.     Catena\'s increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover of Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business profile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo dealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a trading and industrial company.     In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB.

'Audi AG NSUG.F, the 99 pct owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, said profit in 1986 fell by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record 221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous year.     Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.     He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified amount from 1985\'s record levels.     Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from 9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10 billion this year.     Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi would ensure VW got a share of profits.     Audi\'s entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years VW had received 80 pct of Audi\'s earnings as a dividend.     Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About alleged \"sudden acceleration\" of some of its Audi 5000 models.     As reported, Audi\'s sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct to 59,800 last year.     Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom out in 1987.     Audi\'s worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.     Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000, but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180 in 1985.     Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to 57,000.     Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen compared with 1985\'s 392,000.     Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to further new hiring of employees.     At the end of 1986 Audi\'s workforce stood at a record 39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985.  \n',earn
'Dutch dairy and general foods manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV WESS.AS, said it is planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong profit growth over the next 10 years.      Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the presentation of Wessanen\'s 1986 report he already expected 1987 first quarter profits to show an increase.     The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985.     This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar\'s guilder value, van Driel said.     Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985 level of 3.20 guilders.     Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders.     US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover, compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide.     Van Driel said the company would continue an active takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit.     He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China.     He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln guilders and would if necessary make new share issues.     Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln dlrs. He said Balanced Foods and Green\'s Dairy, taken over late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs which was not included in the 1986 account.     All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13 pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to this growth was the successful introduction of new products, which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US acquisitions, van Driel said.     Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986 turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said.     The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich, Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said.     Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles for the company to raise capital for future expansion.     He estimated that 33 pct of the company\'s shares were in foreign hands.     The company\'s 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step, van Driel said without elaborating.     Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which produces around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospects for its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said.  \n',earn
'Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale WELG.F said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLB International SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6 mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier.     WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to WestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.     The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record profit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to changed market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of 1987 developed positively, it added.     WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for international credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in 1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.     Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln in 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from 10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that credit business redemptions were not fully offset by new lending.     The statement said WestLB International\'s business with private customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.     This development was aided by cooperation between the bank and the savings banks in the West German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.

Woodside earlier reported attributable net loss rose to 17.14 mln dlrs in 1986 from 8.73 mln in 1985, although group revenue rose to 220.84 mln from 173.50 mln.     It said it should have received a 1.7 mln dlr tax credit but instead made a 10.04 mln dlr tax provision. This largely related to its Vamgas Ltd unit, non-allowable exchange losses and tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project not recognised in the accounts.     Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full year sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of the Shelf project, against six month sales in 1985.     Offsetting this was a 23 pct fall in the Cooper Basin gas and liquids revenue of its 50.6 pct-owned Vamgas unit.
