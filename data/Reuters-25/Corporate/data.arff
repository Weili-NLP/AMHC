'Air Canada\'s 54 mln U.S. dlr acquisition of Gelco Corp\'s GEC Canadian unit has dramatically altered Canada\'s fast growing courier industry, largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company officials and analysts said.     State-owned Air Canada takes over the country\'s second largest overnight courier business just two months after another Canadian company, Onex Capital Corp Ltd, approved the acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp PCC.     But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies and likely don\'t represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations.     \"It\'s a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time,\" McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst Tony Hine commented.     The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S. companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin.     \"There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being under siege or taking someone else over,\" he said.     Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco Express marketing vice president James O\'Neil tolds.     The sale is the first under Gelco\'s divestiture program, and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of debt by year-end, the company said.     While company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures, O\'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs a year.     The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program, adopted after another Canadian Company, Unicorp Canada Corp, acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company.     Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator\'s U.S. courier business.     For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco\'s Canadian courier business represents an \"excellent financial investment\" in a market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman Esther Szynkarsky said.     The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.     It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.     She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada\'s strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business.     Gelco will continue to operate with current management, independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door-to-door courier operation.     \"They\'re well run, they\'re a good investment, they\'re doing well in a growing market, and that\'s the way we want to keep it,\" Szynkarsky said.     Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery network, generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in Canada.     \"The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue,\" Hine said.     \"It\'s sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff through, the more money you make,\" he added.  \n',acq

'Dutch chemicals group Akzo NV AKZO.AS said it hoped to consolidate its core activities this year by making small acquisitions in the US.    Akzo chairman Aarnoud Loudon told a news conference on its 1986 report that the company wanted to achieve the same level of US investments it had before it divested its fibre firm American Enka in December 1985, when US investments represented 20 pct of Akzo\'s total capital.    The US expansion plans were not an attempt to compensate for losses in guilder income through the lower dollar, Loudon said.     He said a more important factor was the speed of growth in the US, adding \"It\'s the largest industrial market in the world.\" But he said the company would also be looking at possible acquisitions in Europe.     Despite its highly liquid cash flow, Akzo did not plan acquisitions on a scale that would negatively influence the company\'s debt/equity ratio, Loudon said.

'Allied-Lyons PLC ALLD.L and Canada\'s Reichmann brothers are working well together as partners and currently do not plan any change in their joint ownership of distiller Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts, Allied-Lyons chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said.     Allied-Lyons got 51 pct control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham last year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs, while the Reichmanns\' Gulf Canada Corp acquired 49 pct in an out-of-court pact after a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of Hiram Walker Resources Ltd.     \"We are getting along very well as partners ... I hope there won\'t be any change, but there could be,\" Holden-Brown told reporters after a speech in Toronto.     He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that could force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons, and Gulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligate Allied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct.     \"Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion for either the put or call to be exercised,\" Holden-Brown said.     In answer to a reporter\'s question, Holden-Brown said it would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49 pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons\' consent. \"I don\'t think we would have any objection to it,\" he added.     Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham\'s board of directors and has total responsibility for its management. \"We cannot contemplate giving up our control,\" he said.     Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profit contribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons\' financial results, but he said \"it will be substantial.\"     \"I am not able to give profit forecasts,\" he said.     Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance the Hiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings, and has no current plans for a stock issue.     He said the company is not currently negotiating any more acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating possible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or food concerns. \"I don\'t think we shall be looking at the brewery scene (which is) highly concentrated already,\" he added.

'American Motors Corp AMO management has ordered a hiring freeze in view of Chrysler Corp\'s C 1.5 billion dlr takeover bid, a spokesman for AMC said.     Analysts said the merger is virtually certain to go ahead.     American Motors directors met for five hours Wednesday to review the takeover proposal. \"The board ... Expects to be meeting periodically over the next several weeks on the Chrysler proposal,\" AMC said in its first formal statement since it acknowledged the Chrysler proposal on Monday.     Chrysler, the number three U.S. Automaker, has said the merger is motivated principally by its desire to acquire AMC\'s profitable Jeep business and dealers, as well as a new modern car assembly plant in Bramalea, Ontario.     That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC, but it leaves in question the fate of many of its 19,000-plus employees, according to industry analysts.

'Belgian starch manufacturer Amylum NV is surprised and disappointed that its 675 mln dlr offer for the European business of CPC International Inc CPC.N was apparently rejected in favour of a lower 630 mln dlr bid by Italy\'s Gruppo Ferruzzi, chairman Pierre Callebaut said.     Callebaut tolds that Amylum, a leading starch and isoglucose manufacturer in which Britain\'s Tate and Lyle Plc TATL.L holds a 33.3 pct stake, had made an undisclosed initial takeover offer for CPC\'s European corn wet milling business by the close of CPC\'s tender on March 17.     The offer was raised on March 24 to a final 675 mln dlrs in cash after CPC told Amylum its initial bid was below Ferruzzi\'s 630 mln stg offer, Callebaut said.     On the same day, CPC announced it had agreed in principle to sell its European business to Ferruzzi in a 630 mln dlr deal.     Noting that Ferruzzi was studying a public offering of shares in its unit European Sugar (France) to fund the CPC takeover, Callebaut said Amylum may still succeed in its bid.     \"For the time being we just await developments. But I note that whereas our higher offer was in cash, Ferruzzi apparently is still organising finance,\" Callebaut said.  \n',acq
'CSR Ltd CSRA.S has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share analysts said.     \"It sounds like a good deal,\" Stuart McKibbin of A.C. Goode and Co tolds.     CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead sell it to Exxon Corp XON unit Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs.     In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia\'s largest sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.     \"This will be a big shock to the market, which was under the impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,\" McKibbin said.     A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had given itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.     CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years.     Delhi is one of Australia\'s largest onshore oil producers yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin. Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs.     Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker Bain and Co Ltd said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of Australian-owned assets to a foreign company.     \"The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold back to the Americans,\" Goldston-Morris said.     The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the largest player in Australia\'s 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country, analysts said.     They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.     Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said.     Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging investment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company\'s overall performance, analysts said.     CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely from U.S. Dollar debt, they said.     \"It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely with debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oil price collapsed on them,\" Owen Evans of Sydney broker Meares and Philips Ltd said.     Esso not only picked up Delhi\'s oil and gas output but also gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions.     Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50 Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd BRKN.S.     \"Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland Basin. They haven\'t found too much oil in Bass Strait lately and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,\" Goldston-Morris said.  \n',acq

It said it was confident the offer will be reviewed favourably.     Newspapers in Manila and Hong Kong reported at the weekend that an offer had been made.     Barwon said it was represented by Australian stockbroker Jacksons Ltd, which forwarded a formal offer to Philippine President Corazon Aquino of 100 pesos for each of the 38.1 mln A and B shares of San Miguel.     The Philippine government seized the shares, which represent a 31 pct stake in the brewery firm, from the United Coconut Planters Bank, alleged by the government to be linked with the country\'s deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.

The AGL offer, the third to be made for TMOC this year, compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share.

'Diversified investment company, Ariadne Australia Ltd, has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln shares in the Philippine brewing firm San Miguel, a Manila newspaper reported.     The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne\'s chairman, New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct of the nation\'s yearly budget to buy the shares from the government.     The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in Manila were not available for comment on the report.     The shares are the entire block seized by the government from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion that the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman of San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos.     The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14 mln class B shares.     Government officials have said earlier that the more valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners.     The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might buy eight mln class A shares last week.     \"Judge\'s offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the Philippines\' yearly budget,\" Ariadne\'s Philippine agent Domingo Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.     \"Mr Judge\'s objective in this investment is to make his corporation\'s management expertise available to San Miguel so that the company\'s assets can be fully utilised.\"     San Miguel, the country\'s largest brewer, is also one of the major manufacturers of grocery lines.

Hong Kong Economic Journal also noted stock market rumours that Neptunia Corp, a Hong Kong registered company which controlled by San Miguel\'s president Andres Soriano, is the other party keen on the block of San Miguel shares.

'Avia Group International Inc  stockholders filed a class a action suit in Multnomah County Circuit court seeking to halt the sale of Avia to Reebok International Ltd RBOK.     Avia stockholders also seek to receive compensation from the defendants, who include most of Avia directors, according to court papers.     The suit grew out a meeting of several dozen dissatisfied minority stockholders of Avia following the announcement of Reebok\'s proposed acquisition of Avia and the sudden drop in the price of Avia stock.     The complaint was filed on behalf of Clem Eischen, a Portland-area resident, who owns 500 shares of Avia, and Robert Withers, also of the Portland-area, who owns 954 shares, and other individuals who held stock at the time of Reebok\'s announcement. A jury trial has been requested.     \"The actions of the small group that contral Avia have hurt the little guy,\" said Eischen.     The stockholders, according to a statement, have organized a steering committee.     The complaint reviews the price action of Avia stock from March 1986 and noted the plaintifs who purchased stock between 19 dlrs and 25 dlrs per share.

'Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturer for national security reasons, U.S. officials said.     The officials, who asked not to be named, said yesterday that Baldrige has \"serious concerns\" about the sale of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. to Fujitsu Ltd., another major electronics firm.     The officials tolds that if the sale went through it could leave the U.S. military overly dependent on a foreign /ompany for vital high technology equipment used in its advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence gathering.     In addition, they said, the sale would also worsen the already strained trade relations between the U.S. and Japan stemming from the huge Japanese surplus.

'French sugar group Beghin-Say, which is 49.6 pct owned by Italy\'s Gruppo Ferruzzi, is to raise its capital to 703 mln francs from 527 mln through a three-for-one issue of shares and investment certificates to finance expansion, president Jean-Marc Vernes told analysts.     For the first stage Beghin-Say will issue some 2.05 mln new 65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln francs. The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658,000 new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400 francs, raising capital to 703 mln francs.     The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2 billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans. These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France, Vernes said.     Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of Corn Products\' installations in Europe. Apart from the French plant, these include three factories in each of Italy and West Germany, two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands and Denmark.     Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the installations, and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs, Vernes said.     If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and developing two other French plants, either in the maize or wheat starch sector.     Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion for its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for its capital increase.     Kaysersberg, which was transformed from a division of Beghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year, has been holding talks with other European companies on possible accords, Vernes said. He added the company could be introduced onto the Paris Bourse in the near future.  \n',acq
'Belgian Budget Minister Guy Verhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in several state-owned enterprises, including national airline Sabena and the postal and telecommunications authority, government sources said.     They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francs in revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadt\'s projections, helping the government to reduce its huge budget deficit, targetted this year at 418 billion francs.     But the scheme had received a guarded reception from the Social Christian parties in Belgium\'s centre-right coalition when Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday.     Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult, the sources said.     Verhofstadt proposes beginning the selloffs in the last quarter of 1987, with the sale of 30 to 40 pct of state investment company SNI. He expects the sale to raise three billion francs, they added.     A 25 pct share in Sabena would be sold in mid-1989 for 1.5 billion francs, while 50 pct of the postal and telecommunications authority would be sold off in two stages in mid-1990 and early 1992, raising at least seven billion francs.     Also on Verhofstadt\'s list are the Maritime Transport Authority, leading gas distributor Distrigaz, CGER savings bank, CGER, and several other credit institutions.

'Bond Corp International Ltd, a subsidiary of the Australian-based Bond Corp Holdings Ltd BONA.S, said it would defer its planned rights issue but still wants the issue to be made before July 31.     No date has been set for the issue, announced in January.     In a document to shareholders, Bond Corp said the delay follows its receipt of a 240 mln H.K. Dlr loan from its parent company to meet the first payment on the newly acquired Bond Centre commercial complex in central Hong Kong.     It also wants outside partners to take up to 50 pct in the project, the company said.     The January announcement said the rights issue would finance Bond Corp\'s 1.4 billion dlr acquisition of a 23.77 pct stake in HK-TVB Ltd TVBH.HK from film magnate Run Run Shaw.     The company then reached an agreement with a consortium led by Sino Land Co Ltd SINO.HK to buy a commercial complex that is still under construction for 1.9 billion dlrs.

'British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L said it intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co SRD.N it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.     The offer would be made through its BP North America Inc unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares being tendered.     BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based on its own valuation as well as those of its financial advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and non-public information.     Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down 1-3/4 dlrs.     BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at last night\'s close.     About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP\'s own resources.     The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The company said it was in the course of arranging these facilities.     BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group\'s investment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be made without the limitations of a minority interest.     BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the investment.     Walters added that it also felt that, due to management changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even in a lower oil price environment.     Standard\'s net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.     Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise. One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group should spend so much money buying a company it already controlled.     BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.     It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on the U.K. Government\'s recent announcement that it intended to dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the 1987/88 financial year, analysts said.     Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would depend on the reaction of the markets.     The deal would probably push BP\'s gearing up to around 59 pct from 20 pct currently, he said.     However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not repeat last year\'s rapid drop the prospects for Standard returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from its cash flow -- were good.     Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.     Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from production and its downstream activities would push it comfortably into surplus.     BP initially took a stake in Standard following the discovery of oil in Alaska\'s Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard, which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude oil.     The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management reorganisation of Standard in the past year.     The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the tender offer, Spedding said.     BP\'s willingness to take hard decisions such as major balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well received in the markets.     The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by other sectors.  \n',acq
'BP International and BP North America are seeking a five billion dlr, four year syndicated credit facility in support of British Petroleum Co Plc\'s tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already own, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York said as arranger.     The facility, to be guaranteed by British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L is probably the largest credit facility ever arranged in Europe, bond analysts said. Full terms will be announced either later today or tomorrow morning. BP said earlier it planned a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own for 70 dlrs a share cash.     The financing being arranged by Morgan Guaranty will take the form of a fully committed revolving credit. As announced earlier, BP also is arranging a U.S. Commercial paper program in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be used to support that program.     The exact size of the U.S. Program has not been decided and the dealers have not yet been chosen.     The credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue cash advances with maturities of one, three or six months through a tender panel, which will be comprised of banks committed to the facility.     Despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility, Morgan Guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among BP\'s relationship banks.     As a result, banks were being offered lead manager status at 200 mln dlrs, co-lead management at 125 mln and manager at 75 mln.     Although pricing on many credit facilities has become extremely fine in recent years because of the keen competition to win mandates, Morgan Guaranty said banks would be compensated fairly since this is a special purpose facility which must be completed quickly, with signing expected in about 10 days.  \n',acq

The British source said the decision not to specify the exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door open for further discussion.     \"It\'s probably a sensible approach on their part,\" the British source tolds.     C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a new cable between Japan and the U.S.     The proposed merger has sparked an international row, with British government sources threatening retaliatory action against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices against foreign firms.     The sources said last Friday that one option for Britain would be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London.     The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans, saying that both rival consortia should be licensed.     Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms, Watanabe said, \"They will not be core companies but if they wish they could participate.\" Under the Japanese law, total foreign participation would be limited to one-third.     \"It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which has the support of many influential backers and work within this for the realization of their ideas,\" Watanabe told reporters.     The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp MITT.T, Mitsui and Co MITS.T, Sumitomo Corp SUMT.T, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co MC.T, Toyota Motor Corp TOYO.T, C Itoh and Co CITT.T, and Pacific Telesis International Inc.

'Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L said proposals to resolve a dispute over entry to Japan\'s telecommunications market were not acceptable.     A company spokesman said the proposals appear to have been made in today\'s edition of the Japanese daily Asahi by Fumio Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with the Federation of Economic Organisations.     However, the suggestion still recommended a merger between the two consortia tendering for contracts and would give Cable a five pct stake, more than the three pct originally proposed but less than the 20 pct it holds in its original venture, he said.     The proposal would also offer a Cable nominee a seat on the board of the merged company.     The spokesman said he believed Japan should accept applications from the two rivals for fair review.     Earlier today Cable shares firmed on market speculation that the dispute -- which is being treated by Britain\'s government as a test case of how open the Japanese telecommunications market is -- was near settlement.     Cable shares at 1350 GMT were quoted at 375p compared with a close last night at 364p.  \n',acq
'Shares in Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L firmed in morning trading on market speculation that its participation in a joint telecommunications venture in Japan would not be curtailed, dealers said.     The company\'s shares were quoted at 372p at 0915 GMT compared with 364p last night.     The dealers said the speculation appeared to originate in Japan. Cable has said it is resisting attempts by the Federation of Economic Organisations to merge two Japan-based telecommunications firms, a move which would have cut Cable\'s stake from 20 pct in one to three pct in the merged unit.     However, the dealers were uncertain exactly how the dispute over the shareholdings had been resolved.     British prime minister MargaretThatcher said in parliament last week that she regarded Cable and Wireless\'s participation in the Japanese venture as a test case of how open the Japanese telecommunications market really was.     A spokesman for Cable said he was unaware if the speculation had any foundation. Cable itself had issued no statement today on the issue.  \n',acq
'Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L said new proposals unveiled by Japan for it to become a core member of a merged telecommunications firm to compete for telecommunications contracts did not remove the group\'s objections.     The suggestions by Federation of Economic Organisations official Fumio Watanabe was a formal announcement of proposals made earlier this week and reported in the Japanese press.     Cable has a 20 pct stake in one of the two groups trying to compete against Japan\'s Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd which monopolises Japan\'s overseas telephone business.     But a Cable spokesman said it still believed a merger of the two consortia would be impracticable. \"They are like oil and water,\" he said.     The Japanese authorities want only one competitor and have proposed that the two consortia band together. The issue has been taken up by the British government as a test case on the openness of Japanese markets. Watanabe\'s latest proposals said that the eight core companies of the new group should have equal share holdings but added that they could work out the precise percentages amongst themselves.     The reports earlier this week said that Cable would be offered a five pct stake, up from an originally proposed three pct.     Despite the apparent differences in stakes offered, the Cable spokesman said the two offers appeared to be essentially the same.

'San Miguel Corp, SMC, and United Coconut Planters Bank, UCPB, have reached a compromise on a disputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of a government panel that controls the sequestered shares said.     Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) tolds SMC had offered a price of 126 pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB.     \"It looks good,\" Diaz said. But he added several issues, including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares, had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the sale.     The PCGG\'s sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted SMC\'s bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos.     Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when he fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24 mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration.     \"The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers,\" Diaz said. \"Naturally we do not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies.\"     PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC\'s Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year.     The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos.     PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines\' largest food and beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln \"B\" class shares from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a price of 150 pesos per share.     The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500 mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred shares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to UCPB-controlled trading companies.     The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share made by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend declared in June last year.     A spokesman for SMC said the company\'s 15-member board met today to discuss the proposed compromise.     The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration.     President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15.     Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMC board, filed a formal complaint before the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight other directors of violating \"fiduciary duty.\"     De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC\'s board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan.  \n',acq

'CSR Ltd CSRA.S said it will offer 2.20 dlrs cash each for the shares it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.     CSR already holds 31.74 pct of Pioneer\'s 99.80 mln issued shares, it said in a statement.     The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar share capital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today\'s closing market level of 1.85 dlrs a share.     CSR said it will announce further details of the offer soon, including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer Sugar stock.     It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer Sugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer\'s net earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over yesterday\'s market price which CSR said it believed already contained an element of takeover speculation.     It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer\'s last reported net tangible assets per share, CSR said.     CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings which will flow from integrated management of CSR\'s and Pioneer\'s raw sugar mills and building materials businesses.     These economies can only be achieved through CSR control and management of Pioneer Sugar, it added.     The takeover announcement came soon after CSR\'s earlier reported statement that it will sell its Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd unit to an Exxon Corp XON unit for 985 mln dlrs and not proceed with the previously announced float of part of Delhi.  \n',acq

The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint statement.     The previously announced float of part of its Delhi interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement.     Delhi Australia Fund owns Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd, which holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd STOS.S-led Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.     In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi\'s interests in the next two years, the statement said.     \"The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float,\" CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.     Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership.     With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier, he said.     As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd that it does not already hold, valuing its entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.  \n',acq

'Dart Group DARTA is likely seeking to buy Supermarkets General SGL, analysts said.     \"There\'s been rumors that they\'ve taken a position in the company, said Wood Gundie analyst Edward Comeau.     Last year, Dart Group, owner of Auto Trak INc and Crown Books, competed against Kohlberg, Kravis to acquire Safeway Stores INc.     The company later reached an accord under which it would buy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed its leveraged buyout of the company.     The company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mln to 200 mln dlrs, according to analysts.      Dart Group Corp was not immediately available for comment.     Jerry Ballan, analyst with Conner Ballan division of Edward Viner and Co, said, \"They Dart has been rumored to be buying some other supermarkets as well, such as Stop and Shop.\"     \"My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to be bought out,\" said Ballan.     Analysts, however, said Supermarkets General is facing problems due to its Purity Supreme and Rickels operations, which might make it difficult to thwart a bid.     Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a post stock split basis.     For the first quarter, Comeau predicts the company will earn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago, and should earn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987.     \"But that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily, due to Purity Supreme in New England,\" Comeau said.     He said competition among supermarkets is getting heated in that area and that the company has had difficulty with integrating Purity Supreme with its Pathmark store operations.     Rickels, a home center business, has faced problems due to the state of that industry, and has reported lower returns as an operating unit, according to analysts.     Analysts said that if Dart buys Supermarkets General it would probably divest the company\'s operations.     Analyst Comeau said \"supermarkets general may seek a combination with another supermarket company.\" \n',acq

Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from Deutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal with Creditanstalt.

Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High Court, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the balance sheet section \"participations,\" Christians said.

This represents just over 54 pct of the outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis. But including shares already owned, Dixons now holds a total of 56 pct of the fully diluted outstanding shares.     The company said it is now entitled to subscribe for all the authorised but unissued and unreserved shares of common stock of Cyclops, which total some 5.4 mln shares, at 90.25 dlrs each.     Dixons said it has waived its condition that 80 pct of the fully diluted outstanding shares be validly tendered and not withdrawn.

'More U.S. And European firms will be falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to merger and acquisitions specialists polled bys.     Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S. Banks, steel and other businesses.     In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd ITSU.T -- Japan\'s biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for Fairchild Semiconductor Corp, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers.     Nomura Securities Co Ltd NMSC.T and Daiwa Securities Co Ltd DSEC.T, Japan\'s two largest brokerage firms, are seeking a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the country\'s huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking, the takeover specialists said.     Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists.     Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore.     \"The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. -- Japan\'s largest market and where political risks are minimal,\" a takeover specialist at one trading company said.     Japanese companies have become among the world\'s richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months.     But the yen\'s strength, which has also raised the costs of Japan\'s exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth, the specialists said.     Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against Japanese exports.     Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work. Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little investment opportunity.     \"Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but the recent economic factors have become a driving force,\" said a banking industry source.     So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious.     While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said.     Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now, but that time span appeared now to be too long.     Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said.     A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc\'s DIAC.T takeover bid for Sun Chemical Corp of the U.S. Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he added.     Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical\'s graphic arts group for 550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts-related businesses.     Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese, the trading company official says. \"Japanese people don\'t like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable deals.\" But now after some experience overseas, Japanese companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. \"This is a healthy progression.\"     However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.     \"Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large U.S. Or European corporation,\" one banker said. \"They will expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for Japanese business.\"     A foreign merchant banker also noted, \"There are not many mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big deals there have already been done.\"     But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of Japanese companies, the specialists said.     Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high-technology areas. \"Japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend,\" one takeover specialist said.     Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said.     But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.  \n',acq

'Exco International Plc, a subsidiary of British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc BCOM.L, said it had agreed in principle to buy an 80 pct stake in RMJ Holdings Corp for about 79 mln dlrs.     Exco Chairman Richard Lacy tolds the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc BK.N, which currently holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder.     Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years.     RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the largest U.S. Government securities brokers.     It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies.     Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S. Government securities broker for the past four years and had made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp SPC.N in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs.     B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net income of around 16 mln dlrs.     The company\'s earnings had not been hit by the halving of brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled.     Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in the brokerage business and about 70 in its SMS unit, which provided computer software for the financial services community.     RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a day, and in London where it has 15 billion.     It was also given permission last week to open an office in Tokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to about five billion dlrs a day.

'Schlumberger Ltd\'s SLB.N decision to end an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd ITSU.T to buy 80 pct of its Fairchild Semiconductor Corp, and the political furore that surrounded the proposed sale, will make Japanese companies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. High technology firms but will not halt such attempts, industry analysts said.     The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to Fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S. Expansion by the Japanese firm, said analysts polled bys.     \"The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu\'s North American operations, but it would have been a great boost,\" James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said.     French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending the agreement because mounting political controversy in the U.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake could be completed in a reasonable time.     The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and Defence Department, partly on national security grounds.     Fujitsu\'s acquisition of Fairchild would have given the Japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North American sales and distribution system and access to microprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak, analysts said.     The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional microchip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in the U.S., A report by the Capel firm said.     \"It was an entry point, a port for semiconductors and a marketing channel for other things,\" said Barclays de Zoete Wedd analyst Rick May.     Several analysts said the purchase would not have given Fujitsu access to critical defence technology.     \"(Fairchild) simply doesn\'t have key technology -- that\'s a thing of the past,\" May said.     The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to modernise Fairchild\'s production lines, Capel\'s Murtha said.     The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese firms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. High tech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said.     Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly route of expanding its own production and distribution facilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use the estimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to acquire some less politically symbolic firm.     \"It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but the necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in America remains,\" said Capel\'s Murtha. \"The Japanese will continue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to find ones that are politically acceptable.\"     Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash that blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said. \"They\'re not going to slow up, they\'re just going to buy smaller pieces ... Because of the political risk,\" said Barclays de Zoete\'s May.     Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct shares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as super minicomputer makers, he said.     Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up harming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational tie-ups, some analysts said.     \"This is not really of benefit to U.S. Firms either,\" said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. \"The pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move -- why should the government step in to prevent it?\"     Japan\'s Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime Tamura told a press conference that interference by U.S. Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate.     \"This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter for governments\' comment,\" Tamura said. \"I think it was improper for U.S. Government officials to intervene to the extent they did,\" he said.     A spokesman tolds the ministry\'s view is that international investment flows ought to be free and that such flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing closeness of U.S.-Japanese economic ties.  \n',acq

Fairchild is owned by Schlumberger Ltd SLB.

Brooks also said the company would continue to attempt an exchange of technology and manufacturing agreement with Fujitsu Ltd if successful in its buyout bid.     Futjitsu withdrew an offer to acquire some 80 pct of Fairchild, a semiconductor maker, after U.S. government officials expressed opposition to the transaction.

'Federal Reserve Board Governor Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by permitting formation of financial services holding companies involved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate and securities.     In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank and Financial Analysts\' Association, Heller said, \"I believe that increased diversification along geographic and product lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system.\"     He said he supported the idea of financial services holding companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding Companies in which regulation of various bank, thrift, insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries would be handled on functional lines.     \"Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the bank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would have to be on an arms-length basis,\" Heller said.     Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks\' special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.     Heller said he \"would require the holding company to serve as a \'source of strength\' to the bank by making a commitment to maintain the bank\'s capital.     \"In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as long as the holding company has a positive net worth.\"     Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted to own a financial services holding company, again with the provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise if necessary.     Heller said the effects of these actions \"would be banks that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them\" in which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to \"loot the bank\" was removed.     Such diversification would give access to national and international financial services to corporations across the United States.     Heller said that would mean \"the steady decline of America\'s banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested\" by permitting them to become more competitive.  \n',acq
'The Ferruzzi Group\'s holding company Agricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under the agreement reached in principle between the two companies, a statement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said.     When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, it said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs.     Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations.     It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories employing about 5,000 people in eight European Community countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC states.     The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of 1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or about one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of cereals.     Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both geographically and in terms of products.     It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar and of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader.     It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum quotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and said it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in the future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel.     Raul Gardini, president of the Ferruzzi Group, said the present management of the CPC milling business will be asked to remain in their posts.  \n',acq

Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs.     A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but gave no details.

'Less than two months after First Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy, but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.     In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he\'s looking for ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991, \"so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our independence, if possible.\"     In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major East Coast banks to buy banks in California.     First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western states and has franchise operations in four additional states.     Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the  lucrative California market and the West Coast region.     While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied, \"That\'s undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive not to think that.\"     Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as \"opportunistic\".     He said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate already operates, then cut costs by combining resources.     The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy.     Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, \"We continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us.\"     Banking analysts, however, consider another First Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen any time soon.     Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25 billion dlr bid at the nation\'s second largest bank, \"a very, very difficult decision.\"     With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number four position in the California banking community.     \"The competition in this state is tough,\" he said, noting CityBank\'s recent purchase of 50 financial service branches from Sears Roebuck company. \"CityBank is moving rapidly to move us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth,\" he said.     Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona, Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.     \"Security is, has been and continues to be a highly profitable and obviously well managed company,\" he said.     He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name.     Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy, real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.     Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked, he said, \"I don\'t think it has bottomed out, because I think most of the problems are real estate-related and the real estate problems are going to be with us for several years.\"     Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in the Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate\'s franchise operation.     First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First Interstate financial services in ten states.     While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into the Midwest must come first.     Calling the franchise system, \"moderately profitable,\" Pinola said, \"It is going to take a rejuvenation of the agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed we were generating before the last year or two.\"     On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks 1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.  \n',acq

SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland.     Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs.     Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said.     SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160 mln this year and 159 mln in 1985.     SOGENAL\'s privatisation will be preceded by a capital increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight, giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.     The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in line with the Finance Ministry and government\'s aim of a regional operation, Geronimus said.     He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around 30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share reserved for foreign investors. \"This is too small an operation and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France,\" he said.

'Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc said that, due to poor market conditions for railway freight car manufacturing, it plans to sell its Trenton Works division in Trenton, Nova Scotia.     Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7.7 mln dlrs for the proposed sale.     It also said lower 1986 earnings were due to much lower earnings in transportation equipment and losses in steel castings and forgings, which offset gains in the mining sector and improvements in forestry equipment.     Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipment was limited with export sales frequently restrained by customers\' financing difficulties.     Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railways continued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements at the lowest level in the past decade.     However, there was demand for industrial casting due to increased hydro-electric power generation, the company said.     The company said manufacturing of mining machinery and tunnelling equipment showed greatly improved results in the U.S. and export markets, mainly China and India.     The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity in aircraft engine repair and overhaul and in the manufacture of engine components.

'The price of Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd SHLH.HK\'s stock soared on speculation of a takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd EVGH.HK group, stock brokers said.     They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an announcement by Evergo\'s China Entertainment and Land Investment Co Ltd unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk Hotels from the firm\'s deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06 billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.     Thomas Lau, Evergo\'s executive director, declined comment on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels. But he tolds the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment.     He said Evergo \"was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels.\"     Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia\'s best known hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by Hk Hotels.     Lai Sun Garment Co ltd yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.     Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.     \"It is purely coincidence,\" he said.     But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.     Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.     Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board.     A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far.     Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management styles.     \"Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not fit the conservative Kadoorie family,\" said an analyst who asked not to be named.     Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the current trading price.     Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo, China Entertainment and the group\'s associate Chinese Estates Ltd.

The Hunt group said it offered on March 3 to buy the entire 5.3 pct stake held by dissident shareholder Donald Carter at 14 dlrs each, but has received no reply as of yesterday.     Rosewood, which is owned by the Caroline Hunt Trust Estate, whose trustees include Margaret Hunt Hill, also said it has notified the Federal Trade Commission of its intent to buy between 15 and 25 pct of Comdata\'s common stock.

'Corporate raider Carl Icahn acknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible violations of securities laws.     Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc TWA, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to make with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group.     The SEC issued a formal order launching the private investigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing.     The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out whether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities laws and related rules, Icahn said.     Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition and subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain unspecified companies, he said.     Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals who have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes in companies of at least five pct within 10 days.     Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in connection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he has disclosed that he is among those being investigated.     By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which is obviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was also alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA.     It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they or their officers are the targets of government probes to acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements to their shareholders.     Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and selling more than five pct of a company\'s stock.     SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities law violations have been spawned by the agency\'s widening probe into the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according to published reports.     Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amount of stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or making no filing at all could indicate a scheme to \"warehouse\" shares of stock.     In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting in concert would each amass stock in the company without disclosing that they have an agreement among them.     By failing to disclose that they are acting together the market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is controlled by a group acting in concert.     Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg family of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while it was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc.  \n',acq

'Companies will henceforth be able to own stakes in banks, but these should not constitute a \"dominant\" holding, an Italian government committee ruled.     The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings, headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decision reflected the \"need to safeguard the principle of separation between banks and non-financial concerns.\"     It did not quantify what might constitute a \"dominant\" holding.     The committee also set conditions for the allocation of credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in them, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held by banks in companies or other banks.     Under the ruling, credits given by banks or their subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank\'s capital must not exceed defined limits.     The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifth of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or two-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the group or individual concerned.     Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign banks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks to subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be excluded from the conditions.     The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank\'s capital are not given privileged treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms.     With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank of Italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a bank\'s consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a company or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or indirectly.     Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held is below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest.     The controls will not be exercised in cases where the value of the bank\'s stake in a concern is below the lesser of two predefined limits.     These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the total assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank.  \n',acq

'Japan has sought to assure the U.S. It is not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese international telecommunications company below the legal limit of 33 pct, a Post and Telecommunications ministry official said.     In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister Shunjiro Karasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S. Firms that have expressed interest.     But it does oppose any foreign international telecommunications carrier having a management role, he said.

Merrill Lynch and Co Inc MER and Pacific Telesis International Inc PAC, both of the U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively.

Western diplomatic sources were more blunt.     \"They (the ministry) don\'t want to see Cable and Wireless with a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of strategies to reduce that share,\" one said.

'A Foreign Ministry official dismissed arguments made by senior U.S. Government officials seeking to block the sale of a U.S. Microchip maker to a Japanese firm.     \"They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues,\" Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry\'s North American Division tolds.     U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the sale of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp to Japan\'s Fujitsu Ltd ITSU.T, U.S. Officials said yesterday.     Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale.     U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while Japan\'s supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales.     Takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner, Schlumberger Ltd SLB, does not include Fairchild\'s main defence-related division.     In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make supercomputers.     Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said.     Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying \"the purchase would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor market.\"     Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said.     The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said.     U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite U.S. Firms\' technological lead in the field.     \"The United States believes Japan will only react when bullied, and this is a bullying ploy,\" Salomon Brothers Asia analyst Carole Ryavec said.     However, the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors.     \"The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,\" said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co.     U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan\'s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening Japan\'s market.     A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those set by the pact.     \"It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,\" he tolds.     Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with Schlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman tolds.  \n',acq
'Cable and Wireless PLC CAWL.L and the Pacific Telesis group PAC.N may take part in a proposed merger of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan\'s international telecommunications market, a senior industry official said.     Fumio Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), told a news conference Japanese shareholders in the two consortiums agreed that the U.S. And British companies will be invited to participate in the new merged firm.     The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo\'s request that only one private company should enter the market.     The two consortiums, International Digital Communications Planning Inc (IDC) and International Telecom Japan (ITJ), were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co (KDD) after the market was deregulated in 1985.     Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the size of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign investors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake.     He estimated the two foreign firms\' share in the merged consortium at less than three pct and added that even the largest shareholders could own only some five pct .     Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house C. Itoh and Co. each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium while Pacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. MER.N jointly hold 13 pct .     ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses. Several firms including Toyota Motor Corp. TOYO.T  belong to both.     Watanabe said progress was being made towards a merger agreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with the government on having only one private consortium as two companies might invest \"excessive\" amounts.     He said talks with Cable &amp; Wireless will continue this week.  \n',acq
'Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L is resisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunications firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a change in those plans, a company executive said.     Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one of the two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its share to three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategy Jonathan Solomon told reporters.     That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerful business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm of protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign firms from a meaningful position in the market.     Pacific Telesis Group PAC.N of the United States also holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia, International Digital Communications Inc (IDC).     Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz have written to the Japanese government about the planned merger.     A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also expressed opposition to the merger, he said.     The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again that it sees no need for two competitors to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which holds a monopoly on international calls from Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreign shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm.     In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today met Fumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange the merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked.     At stake is C and W\'s 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre optic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of its global network.     \"C and W wants to start right away on the project, such as application and other procedures,\" said Watanabe, who is also chairman of Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc. The Japanese side is saying that the decision on such a plan should be left with the new firm, after the merger.     \"These decisions (on the merger) were made in consideration of Japan\'s economic conditions and legal systems. I told him we are not a colony or something,\" said Watanabe.  \n',acq
'Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. Computer and semiconductor maker, U.S. Officials said yesterday.     The officials told reporters Baldrige had serious concerns on national security grounds about the sale of Schlumberger Ltd SLB unit Fairchild Semiconductor Inc to Fujitsu Ltd ITSU.T. The officials said the sale could leave the United States overly dependent on a foreign company for equipment used in advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence gathering.     The U.S. Officials added the sale would also worsen the strained relations between the two countries stemming from the huge Japanese trade surplus.     The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the sale in the coming weeks, they said.     Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger\'s position was not known, but in the past, he has opposed the transfer of high technology to foreign governments or companies.

'The Bank of England does not favour the introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said.     Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries\' annual dinner.     Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in.     \"Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators, for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all, the proprietors of the company,\" Leigh-Pemberton said.     He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more efficient market penetration. \"The degree of success or failure (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested,\" he said.     Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past. \"The aim is to pressurise a company\'s management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly or even primarily at the expense of the future,\" he said.     Such bids \"often depend for their success on creating a highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market, and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,\" he said.     In a clear reference recent events, he said \"those in the City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest, be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result.\"     They \"should exercise the most careful judgment at the outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the activities contenplated.

'Automobile dealerships have become large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1 billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.     Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts say.     Retail car sales \"are at a point of transition. There\'s not much that\'s off the table in terms of creative thinking\" about ways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University of Michigan\'s Transportation Research Institute.     The retail car market is \"much more freeform now\" than it was in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.     Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different. Dealerships sold one kind of car--a \"Chevy\" or a Ford or a Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold 738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association.     That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany\'s Volkswagen Beatle--began to gain popularity. The \"Bug\" caused \"a rebellion\" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers, says Jauppi.     One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year, the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers.     \"I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln dlrs a year and didn\'t know what to do with all his money,\" says Cole.     \"There\'s a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that make cars,\" he says.     With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend will let up.     Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D. Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by 1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800 principal owners today.     Many dealers are experimenting with owning several franchises, some of which might compete against each other. \"It used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines,\" Jauppi says.     As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned or open international operations.     Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers, \"are obviously thinking of very seriously,\" says Cole.     Although some say the franchise system might get in the way of a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to trading in car dealer shares.     \"Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those cars. It could happen any time,\" Jauppi says.     \"If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the scale some of these dealers, it\'s going to be very hard to resist taking them public,\" said another analyst.     And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become international.     \"We\'re going to have international dealers--dealer networks that are worldwide,\" he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted particularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster than the U.S., he says.     \"It\'s not totally off the wall,\" says Cole.  \n',acq

'Nippon Life Insurance Co\'s 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said.     The investment in one of Wall Street\'s top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. \"It\'s part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.     The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.     Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.     The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing.     Nippon Life is Japan\'s largest insurance company and the world\'s biggest institutional investor, analysts said.     The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.     The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers\' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments.     Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co\'s board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.     Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,\" he said.     \"It\'s a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there\'s an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\"     Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said.     To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms\') diversification. Now there\'s a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,\" Smithson said.  \n',acq

The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time had come to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas.     \"Everybody wants an open investment policy, but there have to be some exceptions for the national interest,\" Baldrige was quoted as saying.     The newspaper said Baldrige and Weinberger are expected to bring the takeover issue before a top-level interagency policymaking group, such as Treasury Secretary James Baker\'s Economic Policy Council or the president\'s National Security Council.  \n',acq

'peru will sell about 40 state-owned firms to trim a projected 740 mln dlrs loss this year among government-owned companies.     Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others would be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino, president of the government\'s state company holding firm, the national development council (conade).      He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all or part of the companies.     Independent economists warn that the deficit could push inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the govenment target of 40-50 pct.     Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline with a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in eight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits.     Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold, including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock exchange.     Last november, palomino said conade\'s plans included the possible sale of a company producing palm oil and another manufacturing electrical appliances. Shares could also be sold in a copper mine, empresa nacional tintaya sa, in the southern state of  arequipa.

'The Securities and Exchange Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed.     Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers for companies\' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid.     Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions. As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached.     In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said clarifies the SEC\'s present position, the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived, even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so.     The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a \"material change\" of the tender offer under U.S. securities law, SEC officials said.     The SEC has already said that other specific material changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer.     The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived.     SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days.     The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information. Officials declined to identify the two offers.     \"If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination,\" the SEC said.     Federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least 20 business days.  \n',acq

Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that the acquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T and Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV PGLO.AS had not been decided on two years ago as claimed by AT and T.     The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemens at the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT. The result of the negotiations was still open.     Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.     The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairman James E.

'A top Swiss banker called for an obligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds and said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company should be made to declare their share.     In comments at a news conference of Vontobel Holding AG, chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks\' own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board, to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in.     A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swiss franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers.     Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the market with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which were readily available to professionals through specialised information systems.     \"We should make this classification obligatory and publish it in places that are easily accessible to lay people,\" he said. The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these ratings should also be continually updated, he said.     Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies, worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered shares and participation certificates rather than bearer shares.     However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. The recent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG JACZ.Z to take over Hero Conserven Lenzburg HERZ.Z had shown the limits of a 1961 pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone who was not eligible according to the company\'s statutes.     Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do not carry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle of greater democracy in the new share law before Parliament.     \"People buying, for example, more than five pct of a company\'s shares should be made to declare their purchase,\" he said.  \n',acq

Rule declined further comment while the review was continuing.     Rule was responding to panel Chairman Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), who had asked why the department was not acting against \"what appears to be a clear violation of the law.\"     Metzenbaum said Icahn had failed to file a pre-merger notification form with the FTC prior to purchasing more than 15 mln dlrs\' worth of USAir stock.     But Rule said that, for airline companies, a purchaser would be exempt from the requirement if it instead had filed a merger application with the U.S. Department of Transportation.     Icahn filed such an application with the DOT, but the filing was thrown out by the DOT on Friday.

'The Securities Industry Association backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile corporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insider trading in law.     The industry trade association called on U.S. securities firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to guard against illegal trading by employees.     The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers.     But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition activities so long as those functions were kept separate.     The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board of directors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stock exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages.     The report said securities firms \"should be more rigorous in restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis.\"     It said firms should train their employees to understand the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information.     It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid expanding current law in a way that would impede the market.     It said an insider trading definition should exempt a securities firm from liability for law violations by its employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of the wrongdoing.     In the mergers and acquisitions area, the association advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover protection plans without prior shareholder approval.     It said a group or individual buying up a company\'s stock should be required to file a public disclosure statement before acquiring more than five pct of the company\'s shares. Under current law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days after exceeding the five pct limit.     The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a company\'s voting stock shouls be made only through a tender offer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is no limit on open market purchases.     The group said the federal government should preempt state regulation of defensive takeover tactics.     The group said all tender offers should remain open for at least 30 calendar days.     The current requirement is expressed in business days.     It said so-called \"lockup\" devices, in which securities are issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of the target company\'s total common stock.     Association president Edward O\'Brien said the group acted out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate America on Wall Street and investor fears about insider trading and fairness in the marketplace.  \n',acq
'U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction blocking the planned merger of Delta DAL Airlines Inc and Western Airlines WAL, the Court said.     O\'Connor\'s action came hours after a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation had been settled by arbitration.     A Supreme Court spokesman said O\'Connor granted a stay of the injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs, to go through as planned later today.     The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Each of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to provisionally overturn its rulings without comment.     The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of Atlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the merger for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes belonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles.     \"Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,\" Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late last night. \"There was really very little that remained to be done.\"     The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport Employees union sought to force Western\'s management to fulfill a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took place.     The airlines argued that Western\'s promise could not be enforced in a takeover by a larger company.     After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officials last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees should report for work today in their old uniforms, not in new Delta outfits.     Delta announced last September that it was purchasing Western. The merger took place in December, and Western has been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Western name was to have disappeared at midnight last night.     At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to represent Western employees after the integration of the two airlines.     While all but eight pct of Western\'s 11,000 employees are unionized, only Delta\'s pilots are union members.     Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts with Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the Teamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be \"extinguished\" after today.  \n',acq

'Sweden\'s Wallenberg group fought back a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to secure a large stake in Swedish Match SMBS ST, one of the companies at the core of their business empire.     A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.     Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier NOBL ST, in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.     Swedish Match\'s B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares.     The statement said the deal increased Investor\'s stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.     The Wallenbergs\' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.     The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.     The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo VOLV ST out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco ASTS ST and Stora Koppabergs SKPS ST.     Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST by Skanska AB SKBS ST and Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.     Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB ALFS ST.     During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent any raid on the heart of their business empire.     But analysts say the Wallenbergs\' position in the electrical engineering firm ASEA AB ASEA ST is also too small at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe interests to protect its core activities.  \n',acq

'Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. ABNN.AS chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank\'s 10.3 pct increase in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar.     Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release of ABN\'s 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance, notably in the securities business.     He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10 share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank\'s stock.     News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN\'s share price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.     Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and ABN\'s share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.     Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986 by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1 pct to 242 mln guilders, he added.     Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings margins via traditional lending activities, he said.     Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank stocks recently.     He said that of the bank\'s estimated 25 financially troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said.     He added that losses incurred through loans to tin producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had been written off.  \n',earn
'The Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd ADSA.S (Adsteam) said its one-for-five rights issue at 11.50 dlrs a share will raise 228.5 mln dlrs for general working capital and investment, both in Australia and overseas.     The group announced the issue with its first half earnings and said in a statement that the rights issue will be followed by a one-for-four bonus issue.     Adsteam\'s equity-accounted net earnings rose to 75.05 mln dlrs in the half ended December 31 from 55.68 mln a year earlier and interim dividend to 18 cents from 16.     Adsteam shares eased to 14.20 dlrs from an opening 14.60 and yesterday\'s close of 14.50 on the issue announcement.     The issue will be underwritten by Morgan Grenfell Australia Ltd and McCaughan Dyson Ltd apart from the shares to be taken up by Adsteam\'s associate and largest shareholder, department store retailer David Jones Ltd.     New shares will not rank for the interim dividend but will rank equally thereafter.     Adsteam said it expects to maintain an annual dividend rate of 36 cents on capital enlarged to about 149 mln shares by both issues from 99.36 mln.     Adsteam said its diverse industrial interests generally performed well and its results, as the ultimate holding company and beneficiary, reflected this solid performance.     David Jones, owned 49.2 pct by Adsteam, earned the largest associates\' net of 57.38 mln dlrs in the half against 40.29 mln a year earlier, Adsteam\'s figures show.     Wholly-owned and joint venture companies also did well apart from timber, building supplies and real estate, which returned below-budget profits due to the housing downturn.

Alitalia said the drop in North American traffic had been due to a general fall in the numbers of American tourists visiting Europe caused by fears of terrorism.

'Allied-Lyons PLC sees rising profits from 51-pct-owned liquor producer Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts in the current fiscal year ending in early March, 1988, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in a speech prepared for delivery to Toronto analysts.     \"We anticipate that Hiram Walker profits will be well above those of the plateau years,\" he said, referring to the four years up to 1985.     \"In other words, we will have regained the 1985 position and improved on it,\" Holden-Brown said.     Allied-Lyons won control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham last year in a battle against Gulf Canada Corp, which finally got a 49 pct stake after an out-of-court settlement.     Hiram Walker Resources Ltd, the previous owner, reported liquor profits of 282 mln Canadian dlrs in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1985, 278 mln dlrs in 1984, 267 mln in 1983, 294 mln in 1982 and 280 mln in 1981.     Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons\' financial results for the fiscal year just ended March seven would include three months of Hiram Walker-Gooderham profits, but he did not provide actual figures.     He said Hiram Walker-Gooderham\'s profit improvement in the current year will come from a previously announced reorganization put into effect March 1, 1987 and a close partnership with Allied-Lyons\' existing Allied Vintners division.  \n',earn
'Allied-Lyons PLC will report substantial growth in the second half of fiscal 1987 ended March 7, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in answer to reporters\' queries.     \"You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyons in the second half,\" Holden-Brown said following a presentation to Toronto securities analysts.     Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year.     Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs associated with Elders IXL Ltd\'s failed take-over bid for the company, Holden-Brown also said.     But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons\' sale of its 24.9 pct interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said.     \"So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But hopefully you win them all in the end,\" Holden-Brown said.     Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other take-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: \"No, I don\'t.\"     \"We must never be complacent and we must always be very watchful, but I think we would be very expensive,\" he said.     Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons\' share price to corporate earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies in the food and beverage industry.     \"That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had come a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I think,\" Holden-Brown said.     Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons\' move to acquire Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders take-over bid for the company was \"100 pct a growth action.\"     \"We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and that people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was) defensive, but it never was,\" Holden-Brown told reporters.     Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram Walker, Holden-Brown responded: \"Plan might be too strong a word. But I must say I do feel the need for Allied-Lyons to be better known in Canada.\"  \n',earn
'Schweizerische Aluminium AG, Alusuisse, plans to reduce share and participation certificate capital by 50 pct to cover losses in 1986 and those carried forward from the previous year, chief executive Hans Jucker said.     Jucker told a news conference that the greatest drain on its financial resources had been stopped, but after extraordinary charges the net loss of 688 mln francs in 1986 was only slightly under the 756 mln loss of the previous year.     The losses in 1986 and those carried over from 1985 made it necessary to reduce capital by 50 pct, he said.     However, Jucker said the company improved liquidity through a recovery in cash flow and conversion of 300 mln Swiss francs of credit into a subordinated loan.     Trading in Alusuisse shares was suspended on the Zurich stock exchange after today\'s announcement by the company that it would cut its share capital by 50 pct, the bourse said.

'Schweizerische Aluminimum AG ALUZ.Z (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said.     \"The threshold of profitability has returned to the foreseeable future,\" he said. \"We expect already in 1987 approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that our industrial environment does not worsen.\"     He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past losses.     Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986 after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985.     Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion.     Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for 1985.     But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news conference the new management installed a year ago had decided to restate the previous five years\' accounts to eliminate rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an asset.     Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from 472 mln in 1985.     It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining, after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in 1985.     Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from 1985, had wiped out the company\'s remaining reserves and exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a 50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22.     Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this \"radical elimination of the mortgages of the past\" painful, but said the foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy.     Haerri said despite the losses, the company\'s liquidity was strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56 billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion.     Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111 mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct in 1985.     In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland SBGZ.Z, Swiss Bank Corp SBVZ.Z and Credit Suisse CRSZ.Z, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan.     The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987.     Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts.     That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169 mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a 479 mln loss instead of 179 mln.     The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders\' equity of 1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar alternations were made for previous years.     After 1986 losses, shareholder\'s equity stood at only 895 mln francs.  \n',earn

'The recent deterioration in the steel market makes it important for Arbed SA ARBB.BR to maintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in a statement.

Arbed had managed to make a 890 mln franc net profit, slightly down from the 1.12 billion profit in 1985, thanks to lower raw material costs and prudent management, the company said.     Arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the market deteriorate further, but the decision of the European Community to maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally, should under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect.

'British Columbia Resources Investment Corp, earlier reporting higher full year operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a four year term.

The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals and completion of formal documentation.

However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company\'s trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.     Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred shareholders, with payment expected in early April to shareholders of record March 31, the company said.     If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co WTC, B.C. Resources said.     The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia.

Gains on the sales of Westar Timber\'s Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the company said.

Turnover rose by by more than one billion dlrs to 3.6 billion, the parent company said in a statement. The rise, however, partly reflected the inclusion of the first full business year of three acquisitions made in 1985. Excluding these, BASF Corp turnover rose four pct from 1985.     Acquisitions were the high-performance connecting materials operations of Celanese Corp, Inmont Corp bought from United Technologies and American Enka bought from AKZO NV AKZO.AS.     BASF said it expected a U.S. Investment of 240 mln dlrs in 1987, part of a five-year programme totalling one billion.

BASF said that work this year had begun in Geismar, Louisiana, on plants for production of special amines and polytetrahydrofuran, as well as for expansion of capacity for producing tetrahydrofuran.  \n',earn
'A strong performance from all BAT Industries Plc\'s BTI.L major sectors enabled the group\'s 1986 pretax profits to pass the one billion stg level for the third year running, Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement.     The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39 billion, which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.     Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth Avenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper.     Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a four pct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume.     The results were largely in line with analysts expectations and BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT.     BAT said the U.S. Brown and Williamson unit held most of its 1985 gains and increased profit 18 pct in dollar terms.     Financial services saw profits double to 282 mln with both Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth.     Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual premiums to 39 mln stg. BAT said it increased new business by 38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first quarter. Its permanent health insurance was now the market leader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in the U.K.     Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1.03 billion. Its life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting results in the second half.     Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio dropped to 41 pct from 51 pct. The net ratio, at 26 pct, left the group strongly placed to pursue its further development.     Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg, nearly three times the 1982 level, with Wiggins Teape\'s sales rising 36 pct to pass one billion stg.

'BAT Industries Plc BTI.L 1986 results, which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed the company was in a strong position and that its shares were probably undervalued, share analysts said.     BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading after a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538p earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39 billion pre-tax.     Stock market analysts said today\'s generally weak stock market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the share price.     \"In the current market, people almost expect companies to beat expectations,\" said one analyst, adding that pretax profits of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.     BAT\'s 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985 pretax profit of 1.17 billion.     Brokers noted that BAT\'s shift away from its underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.     BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74 pct four years ago.     Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company declining further as other sectors increased in importance.     He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial services, in particular in the U.S.     Sheehy also said the group had \"no sizeable acquisitions\" in sight in the near future.     Analysts said BAT\'s increasingly good performance in the U.K. Insurance area was encouraging.     Its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16 pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to make major acquisitions, they said.  \n',earn
'Chemicals group Bayer AG BAYG.F said it expects to post another good result in 1987 after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986.     The company said that this was despite the mark\'s further strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and despite an increase in competitive pressure.     \"The further progress of our business will depend largely on the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy costs.     Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year\'s record of 3.15 billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72 billion from 1.62 billion.     The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985 results, up one mark from a year earlier.     Bayer said that world group operating profit declined slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed a further improvement.     Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to 40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark.     Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought pressure on selling prices, it added.     In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against 1985, the company said without giving details.     \"The western Europe, North America and Far East regions developed well in local currency, but here too the translation of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture, especially in the case of North America,\" it said.     Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in 1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks.     Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986, resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset falling prices and cost increases in other areas.     The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income. Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw materials all developed well, it said.     Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period.     Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower.     Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarter against 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985.  \n',earn
'Bayerische Vereinsbank AG BVMG.F expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987 earnings but profits will only barely reach last year\'s record levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said.     He told the annual news conference that possible credit risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.     Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from 222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.     Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased slightly and stood around 0.7 pct.     Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.     Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.     The parent bank\'s 1986 partial operating profit, which excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed two pct to 671 mln marks.     The parent bank\'s balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5 billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.     It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.     The mortgage sector\'s share in total parent bank business volume rose to 46 pct from 45.     Hackl said that in January and February this year, the bank\'s credit business had not livened up. But despite the sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared with the same year-ago period.

'Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG BKFG.F, BfG, partial operating profits fell to 182.6 mln marks in 1986 from 313.7 mln in 1985, new majority shareholder Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG AMVG.F, AMB, said.     But total operating and extraordinary profits, including earnings from currency and securities trading on the bank\'s own account and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms, were more than double the previous year\'s level, AMB said.     BfG\'s 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB\'s capital increase, which is to finance the insurance company\'s acquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG.     Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid an unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company, Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG, from which AMB has acquired the majority stake.     The bank has said its business last year suffered from the turbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housing concern Neue Heimat.     AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG\'s business volume to 50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus.     The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from 981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in the interest margin to 1.9 pct.     A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from 188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.     The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up risk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasised because of the continuing difficulties of some countries.     Disclosed risk provisions, which under West German accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount, rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.     BfG\'s parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in 1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct of this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for 14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.     BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01 pct of Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG, 74.9 pct of BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG and five pct of Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG. The sale was linked to AMB\'s acquisition of a majority of BfG.     These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transfer agreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions.  \n',earn

'Australia\'s largest company, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd BRKN.S (BHP), is expected to report a net profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first nine months ended February 28, share analysts polled bys said.     This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the first three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31 1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.     The analysts estimated that the group would report a third quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.     BHP\'s earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted to 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.     The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait fields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and steel earnings.     They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been affected by industrial and production problems.     The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP\'s lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors, and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around 300 mln dlrs.     One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on capital expenditure in the steel division, they said.     They said they saw BHP\'s full year earnings at around 900 mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from 1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it would be difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit.  \n',earn

Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November 31, BHP said in a statement.     Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of share analysts\' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs.     BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1.     The bonus is being made from reserves which will not qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of dividend imputation next July 1.     The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP said.     BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of dividend will be maintained on the increased capital.     The level of future dividends will be influenced by the implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation, it said.     As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in shareholders\' hands provided they are paid out of profits that have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate.     BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln a year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln.     BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new plant and some operational difficulties.     The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.

'British Telecommunications Plc\'s BTY.L profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old telephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said.     Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results which were released earlier today, Odgers said the company faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems in Britain for three to five years.     He said Mercury Communications Ltd, a Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor.     Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some of British Telecom\'s most profitable areas.     One company official privately estimated that British Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct.     The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, which lead to some disruption in service, could well have encouraged clients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said.     However, he forecast that the last quarter\'s results overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout.     He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at 50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities.     But on balance Odgers said that group\'s financial strength, economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth industry will help produce annual profit increases for the forseeable future.     British Telecom will also seek to expand into manufacturing, he said, adding that research and development expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover.

In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-tax profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion.

Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800 mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired.     Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars\' financial advisor, has told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire financing needed for the recapitalization.     Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the board believes the recapitalization plan is financially superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff.     Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer.     The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday.     \"Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible primarily because of the financial stability and the strong operating results achieved by management in recent years,\" Gluck said.     He said that after the recapitalization takes effect, proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs.     Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be 76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization common and common-equivalent shares outstanding.     Commenting on the company\'s longer term earnings outlook, Gluck said \"we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization.\"     He said the company does not usually release projections, but has done so now beause of the significance of the recapitalization.     Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June.     The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities.     As part of the plan, the company will change its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.     The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide for, among other things, a \"fair price\" provision requiring that certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares held by such interested stockholders.     Caesars World said in a statement that \"the cash distribution will result in a substantial deficit in stockholders\' equity.\" It did not give an estimate of the size of this deficit.     But the company said its financial advisors have said they believe that after the recapitalization, Caesars World should have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to finance its current and projected operating and capital requirements.  \n',earn
'Canada\'s major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing if, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said.     American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing.     Such action \"would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian banks to do the same,\" Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank analyst Donna Pulcine tolds.     \"They (banks) like to appear to be conservative,\" said Pulcine, \"and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing basis and the Canadian banks don\'t, there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non-performing and another bank is not.\"     Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp CCI to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks.     \"In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) have to have the support of the other banks,\" said Meredith.     Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd said at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify, \"wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position.\"     Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs by Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.     Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days. They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until late May, which falls in Canadian banks\' third quarter ending July 31.     Bank of Montreal, Brazil\'s largest Canadian bank creditor, said last week it was not currently considering declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as non-performing.     \"I think that is just for the benefit of the public,\" Walsh said of Bank of Montreal\'s statement.      Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans non-performing.     They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks\' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income.     \"From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks will get the money,\" said Meredith. \"My outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year\'s earnings.\"     Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of 3.80 dlrs for Royal Bank of Canada compared with 3.74 in 1986; 4.30 dlrs for Bank of Montreal compared with 3.59; 2.25 dlrs for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce compared with 2.23;  2.15 dlrs for Bank of Nova Scotia compared with 1.94, and 2.85 dlrs for Toronto Dominion Bank against 2.74.     She forecast 1.90 dlrs for National Bank of Canada against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split.     Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share, assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil\'s interest costs.     \"If the banks didn\'t receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a share. But I don\'t see that as a likely scenario,\" Pulcine said.     Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the Brazilian debt situation was so complex that \"it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year.\"     He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil\'s yearly interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings.  \n',earn
'Canada\'s airline industry, shaken up by a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said.     \"Now we\'ve got a company that can compete with Air Canada,\" said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. \"Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market.\"     The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week as Canadian Airlines International Ltd.     Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the 6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada\'s 50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine pct.     Analysts believe Pacific Western\'s aggressive and cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd.     They said CP Air\'s management style had been not much different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because neither airline was held accountable to its owners.     \"Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line,\" said Bradley.     \"But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air Canada is on the verge of going that way,\" he said.     CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than profits, was \"a perennial money-loser,\" analyst Wilfred Hahn of Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report.     Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.     Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more than 2 billion dlrs.     Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more attention to finances, analysts said.     It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit \"in excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs\" for 1986. However, this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.     Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year, attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.     For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from cost-cutting and careful spending.     Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain.     \"The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody else\'s,\" Friend said.     Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline shares for at least a year.     Analysts said Air Canada\'s immediate concern ahead of a public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes without setting off a political storm.     It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.     Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later, already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of a dozen aircraft from Europe\'s Airbus Industrie.     Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the Boeing Co.     Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet, needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without hurting profits.     Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian Airlines\' profit in 1988 will more than double last year\'s 29.8 mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western.  \n',earn
'Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter ended January 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than last year\'s 697.0 mln dlrs.     However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of provisioning for loan losses established last year because of many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31.     The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5 mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.     Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in calculating first quarter results.     The bank\'s first quarter provision for loan losses rose to 172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.     Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal government\'s Inspector General of Banks.     First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs.     Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to 213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions, non-interest expenses and income taxes.     The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92 billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.     Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100 dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986, but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.     The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4 billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from fiscal 1986 year-end.     \"Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank\'s loans to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987, and there was little adverse impact on the bank\'s earnings prior to the announcement,\" Commerce bank said.     The bank did not disclose a forecast of the impact on future earnings by Brazil\'s suspension of interest payments.  \n',earn
'Canadian Pacific Ltd said fourth quarter 1986 operating profit rose to 91.6 mln dlrs, or 30 cts a share, from 50.7 mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, a year ago.     The statement confirmed released preliminary earnings figures the company released in February.     A 102.6 mln dlr gain on the sale of CP\'s Cominco Ltd interest helped raise final 1986 fourth quarter profit to 193.8 mln dlrs or 65 cts a share.     The company said a drop in 1986 full-year operating profit to 150.1 mln dlrs from a restated 252.7 mln dlrs in 1985 was due mainly to lower world oil prices.     The company said its CP Rail division reported 1986 net income of 119.4 mln dlrs, compared with 133.4 mln dlrs in 1985. It said grain traffic recovered from drought-affected levels of a year ago but was offset by weakness in other traffic areas and increased expenses.     It said the net loss from its Soo Line increased to 33.5 mln dlrs loss from 8.7 mln dlrs loss in 1985, mainly due to restructuring charges.     Canadian Pacific said favorable developments during the year included reduced bulk shipping losses as a result of a recovery in tanker markets and a turnaround in the forest products sector.  \n',earn

'Buoyed by low fuel prices and favourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd\'s CAPH.HK 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline\'s forecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said.     Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings of between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports results tomorrow for its first year as a public company.     Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd SWPC.HK, made its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in May last year.     Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making a total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the prospectus, analysts polled bys said.     They said the airline\'s performance improved in the second half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln dlrs.     The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one U.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company\'s favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time of the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said.     James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline industry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the 1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would affect Cathay\'s net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits of 1.25 billion dlrs.      Analysts said the company\'s estimates of fuel price and currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative.     \"This is reflected in their interim results which showed that profit margin has increased,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.     Cathay\'s six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier levels, but profits rose 69 pct.     The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on the company\'s fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices usually lag behind crude price movements by several months, analysts said.     By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and sterling 12 pct.     \"Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against Cathay\'s major trading currencies helped push passenger yields in the first half up 7.2 pct,\" said James Capel. \"This should continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to end the year up 7.6 pct.\"     A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash under management also improved profits, James Capel said.     A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed to Cathay\'s revenue increase, but the company\'s load factor declined because of increased competition and an expansion of its fleet and services.     James Capel estimated Cathay\'s passenger-kilometres flown last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown climbed 17 pct, though the airline\'s load factor probably fell to 68.8 pct from 70 pct.     \"Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,\" said Tsang. \"This affected its load factor.\"     Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier Hong Kong Dragon Airways Ltd may have contributed to Cathay\'s decision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analysts said.  \n',earn
'Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd CAPH.HK forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over the year-earlier period.

It earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 1.23 billion H.K. Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14 cents a share.     But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance charges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year.     A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraft deliveries in 1986.     However, the company said in a statement good returns from funds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher interest costs resulting from additional lease financing and other borrowing.

'China\'s first joint venture bank, Xiamen International Bank (XIB), reported a group net profit of about 14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the bank\'s first full year of operation.     General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit forecast, saying targets were under study.     Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group\'s outstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs, up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowings rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he tolds.     Liu said most of the group\'s profit came from the parent company rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries Xiamen International Finance Co Ltd in Hong Kong and Luso International Bank Ltd in Macao.     The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985 but did not officially open until March 1986.     Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign partner, Hong Kong-listed Panin Holdings Ltd, had been cut last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign banks felt the XIB\'s reputation would be improved if the three Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.     Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were unfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a loss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of 268,000 dlrs in 1985.     The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15, Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10).     One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on unequal terms with state-owned banks.     The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost saturated, he added.     Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted from contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank.

'Automobiles Citroen expects rising sales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits significantly this year, continuing a financial recovery after six straight years of losses, president Jacques Calvet said.     Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX sports model, he said: \"All the budgetary forecasts that we have been able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement in 1987, compared with 1986,\" he added.     Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA PEUP.PA group, increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct in first two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It is aiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after 11.7 pct in 1986.     The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the European market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from 2.9 pct in 1986.     \"Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the demand,\" Calvet said. \"This is a relatively new problem for us.\"     Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut the deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to modernise its range and improve productivity.     Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen\'s 1986 profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs.     This weekend he said that those profit estimates \"remain about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic.\"     Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the AX, launched on the French market last October. It will be available throughout most of western Europe within four months.     The car has registered just over 20,000 sales.     It is being built at Citroen\'s large plant at Aulnay-sous- Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and Vigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of 1,000 cars a day.     The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model between its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to compete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa.     The AX had built up its market share in France to around four pct last month. Calvet said: \"Our hope is that once the AX is fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent of the national market.\"  \n',earn

'Comalco Ltd said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.     It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.     Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final dividend, delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws.     This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985.

'Commerzbank AG CBKG.F said a dividend of nine marks would be proposed for ordinary shareholders on 1986 earnings after eight in 1985.     It added in a statement that parent net profit rose to 288.2 mln marks in 1986 from 221.7 mln the prior year.     A Commerzbank spokesman noted the figures were,however, preliminary and required approval of the bank\'s supervisory board which meets today.     The Commerzbank statement added the distributable profit last year rose to 228.2 mln marks from 161.7 mln in 1985.     With inclusion of the corporate tax allowance, qualifying domestic shareholders would receive an effective dividend of 14.06 marks per share.     Total dividend payout would rise to 186.8 mln marks from 142.0 mln on 1985 earnings due to the increase in the dividend and in equity capital, it added.     From the parent net profit, 60 mln marks would be placed in published reserves, unchanged from the two prior years.     The shareholders\' meeting take place on May 22 in Hamburg.     The statement said holders of Commerzbank participation certificates in a total nominal value of 425 mln marks would receive the remaining 41.4 mln marks of the distributable profit.

'Commerzbank AG CBKG.F management board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be lower than in 1986.     In the first two months of the year, partial operating profit -- excluding trading on the bank\'s own account - declined, he said, without giving details.     The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of 1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly. By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased.     German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp said last year the figure for the first time had topped one billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was around 50 pct higher than this.     Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, \"we were able to raise the full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of 1985 because own account profits increased slightly.\"     He gave no concrete details but added that in January and February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure.     The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in future, developing, for example, more into investment banking, keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets.     Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had been a strong growth in business volume.     Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2 billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added.     Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15 billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relationships had remained unchanged.     In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985\'s 2.56 pct despite pressure on credit rates.     The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said.     Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct to more than 650 mln.     As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks.     Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year from 233 mln in 1985.     Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a \"high two-figure million\" in profit from the sale of the bank\'s AEG AG AEGG.F shares to Daimler-Benz AG DAIG.F during the latter\'s majority stake purchase booked last year.     The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior years, to its full extent.     Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further.     Seipp said that because about half the group\'s exposure to problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks.     \"This means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default,\" he added.     Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems.     All banks had significantly strengthened their capital base, most European banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties.     He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new approach to indebted nations\' problems. There was a lot of interest in direct investment via an equity participation in Latin America, particularly from West German firms.  \n',earn

'(Consolidated-Bathurst Inc) said it expects improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in the second half of 1986 to continue this year. The continued improvement would be due to good market demand, better product prices and high operating capacity, the company said in its annual report.     Consolidated-Bathurst, which reported operating profit of 104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said its joint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar, B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contribute to equity earnings.     Last year\'s results were up from 1985 operating profit of 80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs.     The company said it views its near-term prospects with improved optimism.     It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in the U.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacity and production and more favorable market conditions.     It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987 for its Diamond-Bathurst Inc (DBH) subsidiary, which lost 6.2 mln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year, and expects higher sales and earnings for its other North American packaging divisions.     Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its Europa Carton unit is mixed.

'Continental Illinois Corp\'s CIL Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule Brazil\'s debt payments taking at least three to six months.     Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks are under way.     \"I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer, for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil\'s debt,\" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.     \"I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just how long the run is is anybody\'s guess,\" Swearingen said.     Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil\'s moritorium may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.     The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago, Continental\'s largest subsidiary, said in response to an inquiry.     Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.     Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for 1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses. Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.     In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.     The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC, during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the 1984 restructuring agreement with the government.     The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987, Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.     In 1986 the bank\'s loans to the Midwest\'s middle market rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.     Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it bought three small suburban banks.     Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.     He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who will eventually own the firm because it still holds the equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.     The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984 bailout of the bank.     Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not comment on a successor.     The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country doesn\'t need external sources of cash.  \n',earn

'CRA Ltd CRAA.S said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1, making 13 cents for&#127;the year against 15 in 1985.     The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against analysts\' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to&#127;160 mln.     CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been p&#127;id.     The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.     Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout, it said.     Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of gold producers.     Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.     Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.     World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance, but overcapacity continues, CRA said.     Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd BUVA.S contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd\'s CMAC.S net was 37.8 mln.     Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.     Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985, CRA said.     Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln.     CRA\'s share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.     CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.     Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions, CRA said.     Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.     CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985 mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0 mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost.  \n',earn
'Creditanstalt-Bankverein CABV.VI is likely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12 pct of share capital, deputy general-director Guido Schmidt-Chiari said.     The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank\'s share capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986 from 2.7 billion a year earlier.     Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.     Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.     The banking group\'s consolidated balance sheet total rose to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion.     General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last year\'s better profits had resulted from improvements in services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling lending.     Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when compared with those in other countries, he said.     Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits, Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure.     Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations, removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet total.     In an attempt to generate more foreign business, representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and drawing dividends.     Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers said improved results had been widely expected by investors.     Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in 1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of 2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria\'s largest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and large Austrian companies.

'Deutsche Bank AG DBKG.F has seen a slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986, management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said.     Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference.     Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78 billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion.     Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank\'s own account, not included in partial operating profits.     Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest surplus in a section current earnings from securities and participations.     In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from 1.45 billion.     As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits.     But it said that total operating profits, including own account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the parent bank.     Banking analysts said this put group total operating profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank operating profits at over five billion marks.     Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its unchanged 12 mark dividend.     The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986, and developments so far this year showed that was correct, Christians said.     West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits.     The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a high level of risk provision, Christians said.     Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in 1986 from 765 mln in 1985.     Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily reflect the full amount of risk provisions.     Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said Deutsche\'s total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985 because of the fall in the dollar.     He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of such problem country debt had been written off.     Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of \"other securities,\" to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the parent bank.     Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due to its increased activity in international share placements, with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA\'s international placement last year remaining on its books.     Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to place these shares and conclude the original placement.  \n',earn

Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct, it said.     Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries to cope with the yen\'s sharp rise are beginning to brighten their business outlook, the institute said.     It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reduce corporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improved performance outlook.     Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction businesses, it said.     The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88.  \n',earn
'Media group John Fairfax Ltd FFXA.S said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected the impact of changes in the Australian tax system.     Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to 25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mln a year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30 mln from 44.29 mln.     Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on fringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, the company said in a statement.     Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue growth in the television industry as another reason for the flat first half earnings.     It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of these factors.     Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, as did the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremely satisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly.     But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0 pct rise in revenue, it said.     Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the receipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from Australian Associated Press Pty Ltd (AAP) after the sale of AAP\'s \"B\" shares ins Holdings Plc RTRS.L.     This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit.     Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the full year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr acquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbourne will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.  \n',earn

'West Germany\'s chemical industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987 turnover will stabilize around 1986\'s 140 billion marks, Josef Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said.     Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG BAYG.F, told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as well as crude oil and commodity prices.     Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.     The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.     Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price competition and increased costs.     Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years, neutralized the negative impact.     Strenger said the industry would try to increase production in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of West Germany.     The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and 22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.     Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.     Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late last year.  \n',earn

'Gulf States Utilities Co said its condition has \"significantly deteriorated\" and that its operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless it receives additional financing or rate relief from state public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana.     In the company\'s newly-released annual report and 10-K filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the utility last month that no additional credit would be granted. Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs.     \"The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company may have to seek protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy code,\" Gulf States said.     The utility had previously said it might be forced to consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf States\' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.     \"If the regulatory commissions approve the company\'s proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period, the company believes it could achieve financial stability,\" Gulf States said.     In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1 mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas.     Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in emergency rate relief.

'The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp HKBH.HK is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and 13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth, share analysts polled bys said.     Their estimates of the bank\'s net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.     They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue.     Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year, probably one for three or one for five.     The bank\'s 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd HSGH.HK is to report its 1986 results on Friday.     Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to 12 pct.     They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.     Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise, Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.     \"They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand, as their loan portfolio is well balanced,\" an analyst at Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.     Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.     Loans to finance Hong Kong\'s visible trade, the mainstay of the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985.     Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986, but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.     The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.     \"The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks,\" one analyst said.     The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd WAIA.HK and James Capel and Co, analysts said. \"Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter,\" an analyst said.     Wardley was underwriter for last year\'s billion-dlr flotation of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time.     The bank\'s stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake in South China Morning Post Ltd, the larger of two English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.     The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.     Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced need to write off bad debts. \"The need for provisions was much lower than the year before,\" said Tony Measor of Hong Leong Securities Co Ltd. \"Last year\'s profits should have been 2.8 to 2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions.\"     Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.     The bank\'s Latin American exposure, mainly through its 51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc MM, appears to have improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland\'s 1986 fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145 mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.  \n',earn

'Hoechst AG HFAG.F said in a statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.     The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.     World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in 1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01 billion from 42.72 billion.     Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.     The statement made no mention of net profit figures. Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.     In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from 1986, Hoechst said.     Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.     Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to American Hoechst Corp.     Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.     Roussel Uclaf RUCF.PA and most domestic non-consolidated partners did not perform as well as in 1985.     Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in extraordinary costs.     The fall in raw material prices was not enough to compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and currencies, Hoechst said.     The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new projects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the acquisition of Celanese Corp.     Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to form Hoechst Celanese Corp.  \n',earn

The company reported an operating profit of 33.0 mln dlrs, or 32 cts per share, for fiscal 1986, compared to an operating loss of 9,055,000 dlrs, or 1.23 dlrs per share, in the previous year.      Hudson\'s Bay holds about four mln shares of Dome\'s 10 pct series one cumulative subordinate convertible preferred shares.     Last March, Dome suspended payment of dividends on all preferred shares until June 1, 1987. The shares give the holder the right to convert to Dome common shares at 3.33 dlrs per share.     Dome has the right to force conversion if Dome common reaches 3.885 dlrs per share. Dome is trading at 1.12 dlrs per share, down one ct, today on the Toronto Stock Exchange.     Hudson\'s Bay also said it had an increase in 1986 in retail operating profit to 185.3 mln dlrs from 111.4 mln dlrs, but that was partially offset by an increase of 14.9 mln dlrs in interest costs and 25.3 mln dlrs in taxes.      Hudson\'s Bay also said its Markborough properties subsidiary had an operating profit of 108.6 mln dlrs, up from 98.8 mln dlrs the year before.     Profit from non-Markborough real estate was 23.5 mln dlrs in 1986, down from 27.6 mln dlrs a year ago.     Operating profit from natural resources was 4.2 mln dlrs, up 1.2 mln dlrs from the prior year. Pensions costs were reduced by 34.9 mln dlrs due to an accounting change. Total debt declined during the year by 251 mln dlrs to 2.28 billion dlrs and debt to equity ratio improved to 1.8 to one from 2.1 to one.  \n',earn
'Hutchison Whampoa Ltd HWHH.HK expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said.     He did not make any specific projections for the company\'s earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.     It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year, equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share split.     Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.     The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper, compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining shares.     Li said Hong Kong\'s property market remains strong while its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth.     Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.     But he said Hong Kong\'s large trade deficit with the U.S. May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the British colony.     He said all of the company\'s major operations showed improved results in 1986.     Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd HKEH.HK to Cavendish International Holdings Ltd, itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric.     Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share.     Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.     The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.     Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from the government for the spin-off.     He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.

'Jacobs Suchard AG JACZ.Z hopes for another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986 net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said.     The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs.     Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the company\'s target of five pct real annual growth, had been made possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986 which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year.     Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24 billion francs was due to currency factors.     A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset by growth in operations and by structural changes within the group.     Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.     Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25 pct against 25.3 pct.     Pohl said the group\'s average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further increase in tax levels was expected in future.     Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln the previous year.  \n',earn
'Jaguar Plc JAGR.L is about to sell its new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference.     Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly below 1985\'s 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of the new model had kept this year\'s pre-tax profit down.     Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.     U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover, finance director John Edwards said.     A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an \"umbrella\" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car\'s price.     Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.     In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct.     Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg, but Egan said this would take at least another three years     On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar\'s shares were last quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday\'s close, after reporting 1986 results which were in line with market expectations, dealers said. ... \n',earn
'The extended decline in Japan\'s overall business performance was likely to bottom out in the current January-March quarter, the Finance Ministry said.     Improved corporate earnings and better prospects for the stability of the yen had made companies more optimistic, it said after carrying out a quarterly survey.     The survey, conducted in February, was based on questionnaires returned by 8,328 large and small firms in all sectors except the finance and insurance industries.     The survey said overall corporate earnings were expected to turn positive with an estimated 0.4 pct year on year increase in the second half of fiscal 1986 ending on March 31 after a 5.4 pct decrease in the first half.     Corporate earnings will grow further in the first half of fiscal 1987, rising an estimated 10.7 pct, it added.     Manufacturers\' earnings, hit hard by the yen\'s steady rise against the dollar, will rise 7.7 pct in first-half fiscal 1987 after falling 10.7 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, it said.     Overall earnings of non-manufacturing companies will rise 11.8 pct year on year in the first half of fiscal 1987 after growing 9.8 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, the survey said.     It said this figure was bolstered by profits of firms such as electric power and gas companies which have benefitted from the yen\'s appreciation.  \n',earn
'Current profits of Japan\'s major firms in the October-December quarter rose four pct from a year earlier to 5,654 billion yen against a 2.6 pct year-on-year rise in the preceding quarter, the Finance Ministry said.     The improved earnings resulted mainly from a 22.5 pct profit increase in non-manufacturing industries, supported by an 88.7 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain in real estate, according to a ministry survey.     Total sales of the 15,308 firms with capital of 10 mln yen or more which responded to the poll, fell one pct to 217,217 billion yen against a 1.2 pct fall the previous quarter.

'Japanese corporate earnings will rise 8.9 pct in fiscal 1987/88 for the first year-on-year increase in three years, partly because of the yen\'s stable exchange rate, the Nomura research institute said.

Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in the current fiscal year with sales forecast to drop 14 pct.     The forecast assumes an average rate of 148.5 yen to the dollar in 1987/88, compared with 160 yen in the current year.     Corporate efforts to cope with the yen\'s appreciation, such as cutting production costs, are expected to bear fruit next fiscal year, the institute said. The economy should also benefit from pump-priming expected from the government and a halt in rising prices of manufactured goods, it said.     Recurrent profits of manufacturing industries are projected to rise 29.6 pct next fiscal year against an estimated 40.1 pct fall in the current year.

'Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd JARD.HKG said it planned a bonus issue of four new \"B\" shares of 20 H.K. Cents each for every ordinary share of par value two dlrs.     A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total 1987 dividend of four cents per \"B\" share, while the \"A\" share dividend will be maintained at last year\'s level of 40 cents a share.     Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986 net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985.     Shareholders\' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from 4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said.     It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd HKLD.HKG, Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan.     He said the group\'s stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a reorganisation, is \"a long term investment and now stands at a level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset imbalance.\"     Keswick said the issue of new \"B\" shares will give the group \"the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which has been brought about through the group\'s recent restructuring.\"     He said the new issue is pending approval from both the firm\'s shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.     The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation, with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to the new unit Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd.     Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two companies spun off from Hk Land -- Mandarin Oriental International Ltd and Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd -- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson.     Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrs last year, will become debt free after the restructuring.     \"A positive cash flow from operations and disposals, continuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet,\" Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests in airfreight operations, Australian properties and trucking business, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities.     Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its general trading business in the Middle East in view of the continuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he said the operations would be profitable in the longer term.     He said the firm\'s function \"has evolved into one primarily of strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy.\"     He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the board of directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacific regional board. He gave no further details of the change.     Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs at midday on the Hong Kong stock market.

'A strong performance by its retail businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd JARD.HKG to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in 1986, stock analysts said.     They tolds they expect the firm to show earnings of between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln in 1985.     The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a share in 1985.     James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson\'s 1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income to retail sales.     Analysts said the group\'s 7-Eleven retail stores and its franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.     Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine Matheson\'s 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465 mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.     But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson\'s earnings from its 35 pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd HKLD.HKG will fall to about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.     The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong Kong Land of Dairy Farm International Ltd last September.     Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the year as part of its retail business, which will increase its overall retail income figures.     Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct share of Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd.     Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986 of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.     Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln dlrs of 1985, while the company\'s term debt remained at about the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.     But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.     Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its diverse interests.     It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd in which it has a 41 pct interest.     A company statement issued last month said the firm will use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.     Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is likely to develop its own business, analysts said.     \"The future of the stock will depend on the firm\'s ability to creatively structure some new acquisitions,\" said Hargreaves of Hoare Govett.     He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its existing business.  \n',earn

'Kloeckner &amp; Co KGaA, the international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.     The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.     It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary because of recent declines in raw material prices.     Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in prices as well as the lower value of the dollar.     It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held largely by family foundations.     Kloeckner\'s nominal 100 mark profit-participation certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield of around 10 pct.

'The Fried.

Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5 billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from 16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.     Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar\'s weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.     The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.     Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had underpinned machinery and component activities.     An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the trading and services sectors, affected the group\'s total order figures.     However, \"all business sectors contributed to the positive results achieved in 1986,\" Krupp added, without giving details.     Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9 billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of orders against 40 pct in 1985.

Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.     The steel market weakened increasingly over the year, mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer industries.

'Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG [OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard Wagner said.     Wagner told a news conference that last year\'s 34.3 pct rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling interest rates.     The bank, Austria\'s third largest, raised its 1986 dividend to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.     Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: \"We will endeavour to maintain the higher dividend in 1987.\"     Laenderbank\'s balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7 billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.     Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business chiefly on the dollar\'s fall against the schilling, which is effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar\'s weakness had wiped some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.     Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from the bank\'s London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said that it came close to one mln stg.     On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed 8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.     According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct. Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.  \n',earn

Castonguay said Laurentian Group Corp, the parent firm, plans to fill out its national financial services distribution system and make further acquisitions if the right opportunity occurs.     The company also may expand this year in continental Europe, in conjunction with La Victoire, a French insurance company, he said.  \n',earn

'Engineering group Linde AG\'s LING.F world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks in the first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same 1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said.     But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and incoming orders increased 1.0 pct.     Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group 1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln.     Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to 394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln.     Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13 to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde\'s authorised share capital currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks.     Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for acquisitions. He declined to give further details.     While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91 billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming orders would have been four pct above the prior year\'s level.     World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4 pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to 739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge.     World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05 billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05 billion marks.     Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in the refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and order gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks.     The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group sales rising 12.4 pct to 1.52 billion marks and incoming orders gaining 8.0 pct to 1.57 billion marks.

'Shell U.K. Ltd\'s pre-tax profit on exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in 1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices last year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.     But he told a press conference that due to the high marginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact of the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330 mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.     The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, with Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, he said.     As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration and production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.     Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group RD.AS, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg, up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against 8.81 mln.     Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company\'s crude oil output from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986, which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the company. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the current year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline in output from the major Brent field, he said.     Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to be maintained in 1987, he said.     A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months, Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5 billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil price fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.     Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North Sea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.     Day to day operating costs of the exploration and production sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target is to keep costs per barrel constant.     The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to the discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.     Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.     Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit Shell U.K. Oil, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987 were a \"bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.\"     In November and December in particular, refining operations had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil product prices, he said. He expected margins to continue generally positive over the summer, although they could dip to become negative from time to time, depending on price movements.     A new catalytic cracker at Shell\'s Stanlow refinery will now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five months behind schedule, following a crane accident which severely damaged the plant last year, he said.     Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from 11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical site.     Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against PRT, was \"helpful,\" but rather less than had been hoped for.     Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in the range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he would expect some over-production above OPEC\"s official 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.     He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain output was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance, but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will fall.  \n',earn
'Lucas Industries Plc LUCS.L said its underlying performance would continue to improve in the second half but profits would be restrained by low activity in U.K. Commercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in North American electronics.

The figure was some five mln below forecasts and Lucas shares dropped sharply to 557.5p at 1130 GMT from last night\'s close of 590p.     It said it would continue with plans for all its activities to be internationally competitive and profitable.     Costs of restructuring, reorganisation, employee training and retraining, particularly in the UK automotive businesses, together with high research and development spending would affect profits in the short term.

'Consolidated attributable net profit of Ste Lyonnaise des Eaux LYOE.PA is likely to rise by at least 10 pct this year from the 360 mln francs reported for 1986, Chairman Jerome Monod told a news conference.     Group turnover should rise about seven pct from the 15.7 mln reported for this year, while group investments should total around 1.8 billion francs, somewhat above the 1.3 billion annual average of the past three years, he added.     Investments will be aimed mainly at developing the group\'s leisure industry, health and communications activities, Monod said.     In the leisure sector the group planned a joint development with Club Mediterranee CMI.PA, Club Med, of a 200 hectare pleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of Eastern Central France, he said.     Wholly-owned subsidiary Lyonnaise de Developpement Touristique would carry out the construction work and financial planning of the development which would be leased to Club Med as operator of the complex, he said.     He gave no financial details but said leisure sector investments would total about 100 mln francs over the next three years.     Investments in the communications industry would go mainly to develop the group\'s cable television activities and its 25 pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recently won the concession to operate a sixth television channel in France.     Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mln francs over the next four years, of which Lyonaise des Eaux would provide about 175 mln, Monod said.     Monod said Metropole aimed to win a 15 to 20 pct audience share and to capture about 10 pct of the national television advertising market.     Total investment by the group in the communications sector, including cable activities, would be between 300 mln and 400 mln francs over the next five years, mainly concentrated in the coming year.     Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mln and 200 mln over the five years, with the aim of widening the audience to 280,000 subscribers from 12,000, and boosting turnover to around 450 mln francs a year from 10 mln.  \n',earn
'Mannesmann AG MMWG.F expects a difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief executive Werner Dieter told a news conference.     Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer nations.     Domestic business was also declining and orders for West German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986, Dieter said.     Mannesmann\'s profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.     Dieter said Mannesmann\'s pipe activities would suffer a set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started last year, were now having an effect.     Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann\'s turnover. The company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter said had become one of Mannesmann\'s \"strategic aims.\"     He said the company\'s drive to combine activities in mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular \"plus point\" for Mannesmann.     Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.     It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar and lack of demand for steel pipe.

'Morgan Grenfell Group Plc said its 1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc GUIN.L shares and because of securities trading losses in the U.S.     Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group\'s seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some eight mln stg to 82.2 mln.     He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal approaches about a takeover of the group but was not interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not elaborate.     Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during the brewing company\'s successful bid for Distillers Co Plc DIST.L in the first half of last year.     The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price during the bid.     Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness affair.     Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier, resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider information. He currently faces criminal charges.     Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been \"one of the most traumatic in our history,\" but that clients and staff had been supportive.     \"I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet.\"     Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from corporate finance activities and progress in asset management.

The company estimated parent company current losses at 15 billion yen in 1986/87, including a gain of 95 billion yen from the sale of securities. This compares with a 36.07 billion yen profit a year earlier.     Sales in 1986/87 are seen at 2,150 billion yen, down from 2,685 billion a year ago.     Poor business prospects were attributed to the yen\'s rise and slow world steel demand. Nippon is expected to report parent company results in late May.     Total 1986/87 crude steel production is estimated at 25.57 mln tonnes, down from 27.98 mln a year earlier.     Crude steel production is likely to be below 1986/87 output but forecasts for profits and sales in the year starting April 1 are unavailable yet, he said.  \n',earn
'Norcen Energy Resources Ltd, 41 pct owned by Hees International Corp, said earnings and cash flow will improve in 1987, even if oil and gas prices remain at 1986 levels.     The improvement will result from production increases, lower taxes and royalties, reduced financing costs and from operating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during 1986, the company said in the annual report.     Norcen previously reported 1986 earnings, excluding a 20.1 mln dlr writeoff, declined by 58 pct to 50.0 mln dlrs from 119.7 mln dlrs in in 1985.     Norcen\'s 1986 cash flow fell 10 pct to 204.9 mln dlrs from 228.9 mln dlrs in the prior year.     It said the sharp decline in oil prices during 1986 was the most significant factor for Norcen\'s reduced performance.     \"While financial results are far from the previous year\'s record levels, it is clear that Norcen has withstood declining prices and remains financially and operationally strong,\" Norcen said. It did not give a specific 1987 profit forecast.

'Financial and industrial holding company Nord Est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of 400 mln francs, President Gustave Rambaud said.     He told a news conference Nord-Est expected to receive approval from the Bourse supervisory body COB in the next two week, when terms would set according to market conditions.     He said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new investments.     Rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25 francs, unchanged on 1985. Parent company net profit last year rose to 99.5 mln francs against 71.1 mln in 1985.     Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln francs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against 147 mln, was attributable to the group. He said the lower profit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker Vallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake.

'The state oil company Petroeleos de Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said.     Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly, Hernandez said PDVSA\'s income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last year\'s 13.3 billion.     Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said \"had a very serious impact on Venezuela.\"     PDVSA\'s export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined products.     The figure surpassed PDVSA\'s stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year.     The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank. Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA\'s overseas refining and marketing operations.     Consumption in Venezuela\'s internal market increased from 323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However, Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd.     Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of Venezuela\'s reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country\'s production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.      Venezuela\'s total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986 were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the world, Hernandez said.  \n',earn

Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.     A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed on currency movements.     Last year\'s results were also badly hit by a once-off writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.     The company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over.     The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.     Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it having used more funds than generated by group operations, mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular Inc.  \n',earn
'Sports carmaker Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG PSHG.F said it expects to post a satisfactory profit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower but U.S. Sales anticipated higher.     Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic sales were expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from 11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000 from 28,670 last year.     Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Last month the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70 mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86.     For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume this year to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254, Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit were based on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, he added.     The expected drop in West German sales this year would be the result of the so-called \"grey market\" for Porsche cars, he said. When the dollar was strong against the mark, many Porsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegal export to the U.S.     Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87 first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period.     The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a larger percentage of overall sales this year than before does not pose problems for profit, the Porsche board said.     In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around 20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same time Porsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the 1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki.

'A spokesman for Preussag AG PRSG.F said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay a dividend on 1986 results     He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following a difficult year in 1985.     Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.     The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the group\'s other divisions.     The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions.     Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.     The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before. Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.     The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.     The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results.     Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year.     Preussag\'s domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.     Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison figures.     Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0 pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.     Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC) subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year.     AMC\'s large losses in 1985, caused principally by the international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world group losses that year.  \n',earn

'State-owned engine maker Rolls Royce Plc launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is likely to miss contracts to power the proposed Airbus Industrie A340 aircraft.     The company\'s so-called \"pathfinder prospectus\" gives all the details of its stock market flotation except for the price at which shares will be offered.     Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before.     Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit for 1987.     Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings.     Assuming the company was valued at around eight times earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about 1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards.     BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion.     The price will be increased by it being likely to have much of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the company\'s health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.     When the government announced the sale, it said it would inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250 mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.

Operations in continental Europe made 7.8 mln stg in trading profit, up from 3.4 mln, with 4.0 mln stg made in Australasia, up from 2.3 mln, and 11.3 mln stg from the rest of the world, against 13.1 mln in the previous year.     Extraordinary items amounted to a 11.3 mln debit after a 16.5 mln debit previously. A company spokesman said this represented additional provisions for the cost of rationalisation plans announced in earlier years.     Rowntree expects North American operations will this year, ahead of company expectations, be of the same order as those from the U.K. And the rest of Europe combined, the statement said. A spokesman said no specific figures had been forecast.     Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide, including further moves in the speciality retailing business which Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said.     Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast by chairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performance of seven businesses bought last year was encouraging.     The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share and increased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concern increased profit and Rowntree\'s small health food business, Holgates, raised earnings 10-fold, the statement said.     Offsetting factors included currency movements, which cost the company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profits on confectionery operations, and the company faced strong competition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets.  \n',earn
'Royal Bank of Canada, in reporting a 19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to report improved results in future earnings periods.     \"Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income, highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the periods ahead,\" chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.     The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year ago.     Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank\'s international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.     The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103 mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs from 42 mln dlrs last year.     Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.     Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.     The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to 98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.  \n',earn
'Royal Trustco Ltd, in a move unique among Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its yearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said.     First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst Michael Walsh said Royal Trust\'s international growth target is attainable. But it \"will be a tremendous achievement because ... they\'re going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies,\" Walsh said.     Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust\'s 154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company profit, Cornelissen tolds in an interview.     He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26 pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.     Royal Trust, Canada\'s second largest trust company with assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank.     Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.     The company\'s overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980, Cornelissen said.     Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical Co DOW\'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset management, merchant and private banking companies.     \"It was a heaven-sent opportunity,\" Cornelissen said of the Dow Financial acquisition. \"We achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up.\"     Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage, in order to exploit \"profitable niches\" overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management, private banking and advisory services.     He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations \"before the end of this month\" to sell its London-based Savory Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal.     \"The international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business,\" he said, adding that in trust-type services, \"we don\'t think the international markets are well-served.\"     Aiding Royal Trust\'s foreign growth are greater foreign  investment interest in North America and increased Canadian investment abroad, Cornelissen said.     Central to Royal Trust\'s strategy is Asia, boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust.     Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia will contain two-thirds of the world\'s population and 50 pct of global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, \"We knew we had to be there.\" Royal Trust\'s 14 international locations include offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.     The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the \"immediate future,\" although \"we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities.\"     Asked about Royal Trust\'s plans for the U.S., which the company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units, Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks.     \"That doesn\'t mean to say we shouldn\'t be in the U.S.,\" said Cornelissen. \"That is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years.\"     He said the company would continue to emphasize its home Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.     Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks, trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in one another\'s actitivies will mean more domestic competition for Royal Trust, \"but not drastically more,\" Cornelissen said.  \n',earn
'Rugby Portland Cement Plc RBYL.L said it was well placed to operate in the new circumstances following the ending in February of the 53-year old cement manufacturers common price and marketing arrangements.     In a statement following the release of its 1986 results, IT stated that the current year had started well. It reported that pretax profits in the year rose to 35.46 mln stg from 21.84 mln previously on turnover higher at 313.3 mln after 252.2 mln.     The strong recovery of the first six months continued into the second half, although U.K. Cement demand rose only modestly. Results benefitted from cost cutting and higher volumes.     The decision by the Cement Makers Federation to end the pricing agreement reflected pressure from higher competition due to growing imports and the possibility that the system would be taken to the Restrictive Practices Court by the U.K. Government. It stated that its John Carr unit benefitted from strong organic growth, although overseas its Cockburn operation had a difficult period with high maintenance costs and increased depreciation charges.     The company is proposing to change its name at the next annual meeting to Rugby Group Plc.     Rugby said it spent 27 mln stg on acquisitions in 1986. It noted that its Western Australia hotels company had agreed to sell the Parmelia hotel for 31.5 mln Australian dlrs, some seven mln stg above end-1986 book value.     The results were largely in line with forecasts and Rugby shares were little changed at 242p after 241 at Friday\'s close.  \n',earn
'Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer, Santos Ltd STOS.S, said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).     The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985.     Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate.     Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.     It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders\' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.     Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company TMOC Resources Ltd -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs.     Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.     Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program, finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year.     Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.     Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.     But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.     \"It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australia\'s oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,\" Massy-Green said.  \n',earn
'The Sanwa Bank Ltd\'s three-year business plan foresees securities and international operations making a greater contribution to operating profits, a bank official said.     The bank\'s plan also emphasises retail and medium and small-sized business operations, he tolds.     Officials at Fuji Bank Ltd and Mitsubishi Bank Ltd outlined similar three-year plans.     They said lower interest rates and financial liberalisation have cut profits from dealings with big firms to nearly nothing.     \"They don\'t need us, they can do their own financing,\" one official said.

'Saudi Arabia\'s 11 commercial banks are reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non- performing loans.     Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year.     But the kingdom\'s still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable.     One senior bank credit officer said \"The work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions, but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money.\"     The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia\'s corporate sector in 1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad decline.     The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom\'s banks had sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world oil prices tumbled.     Of the kingdom\'s nine joint-venture banks which operate on the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at the expense of increased provisions.     The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, United Saudi Commercial Bank (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln riyals, marginally less than 1985\'s shortfall of 17.0 mln.     Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to 60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985.     Other results released so far show Saudi American Bank (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7 mln riyals, while Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi, known as Saudi French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals.     Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp\'s CCI.N Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez, increased provisions sharply.     Arab National Bank\'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1 mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln riyals.     Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non- performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the Saudi economy bottoms out.     Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity, but one banker said \"The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions.\"     From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom\'s largest bank National Commercial Bank (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector, bankers calculated.     Between 1982 and 1985, Riyad Bank, NCB\'s rival as the second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine.     Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non-performing.     Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres.     Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank as the strongest earners.     Other banks such as Saudi British Bank, 40 pct owned by the British Bank of the Middle East, are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base.     Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions.     Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a Saudi bank go under and not only supported Saudi Cairo Bank after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to Saudi Investment Bank and USCB.     The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans.     And while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending, conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products.     One banker said \"Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not good.\"     Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return on their money.     In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer funds are held on current account.  \n',earn
'Sandoz AG SANZ.Z would have reported a percentage rise in net profits \"close to double figures\" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for November\'s warehouse fire, a senior company official said.     The official, who declined to be identified, tolds Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which caused severe pollution of the Rhine.     Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share.     This year began well, with the performance in January and February at least equal to the same period last year, the official said.     The company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on April 22.     Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident.     The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the \"one pct\" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire.     Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the Rhine since the accident.     However, the official said the final figure would be \"much less than that cited in earlier comments.\" He gave no further details.     In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy CIGZ.Z, which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were also hit by the falling dollar, the official said.     Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to 8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said.     Net profit at Ciba-Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billion francs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs.     The third major Swiss chemical company, F.

A 26.25 mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a very disappointing year.     \"A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a very meagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation of around 10 pct,\" he said.     Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on downstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns and the financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project.     Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrs against 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation.     \"It is just as important for Australia to maintain a financially healthy, technically advanced refining and marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and production,\" he said.     \"The Australian oil industry has the experience and the capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the government would stop putting roadblocks in our way,\" he said.     Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to upgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but further investment required an appropriate rate of return, he said.

In 1982 it posted a profit of 329 mln.

'World group turnover of Siemens AG SIEG.F should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five months, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.     Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02 billion marks.     Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to 21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about 19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.     In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.     In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8 billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.     For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.     Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the communications and telecommunications sectors in particular should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.     But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for 1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the dollar, Kaske said.     Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the same period in the previous year.     Turnover in the first five months rose particularly strongly in the installations and automotive technology, communications and telecommunications sectors, but components and energy and automation showed a sharp decline.     Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.     Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad was balanced by the decline in the dollar.     While the installations and automotive technology sector showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and communications orders were below the level achieved in the same period of 1985/86.     Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same level.     Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to 6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.  \n',earn

'Singapore\'s major banks are diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from loans to debt instruments, banking sources said.     The banks following the trend are the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, United Overseas Bank Ltd, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation and the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd.     The shift towards securitisation has been helped by volatile financial markets which have developed hedging facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.     Loh tolds in an interview that Singapore banks see limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are switching from term lending to major growth areas such as stockbroking and fee based income, he said.     Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now moving into the new government securities market and the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.     One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity market in Singapore.     Loh said the banks\' participation in the stock market has increased business transactions and provided long term growth for the market. The banks are not competition for individual stockbroking firms because of the increased business they generate, he added.     Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because of the increasing ability of foreign and local market participants to absorb new issues.     Loh said OUB Investment management Ltd, a subsidiary of the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors seeking capital growth through a diversified international portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.     DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of the Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.     Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be forced to provide fund management services for major clients seeking better returns, he said.     Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from treasury and investment banking activities.

Overseas Union\'s profits are expected to jump to over 40 mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.

The bank\'s parent company gross operating profits were up 5.4 pct at 21.34 billion francs against 20.24 billion in 1985.     The increase in the bank\'s gross operating profits was mostly due to a rise in french franc deposits and personal loans as well as the development of its financial activities, Societe Generale said.     Parent company net banking earnings last year were also up at 13.9 billion francs compared with 13.57 billion in 1985 while operating costs totalled 7.44 billion francs against 6.67 billion the previous year.     Societe Generale President Marc Vienot said in December he expected group 1986 consolidated profits to rise to between 2.5 billion and 2.6 billion francs from 1.62 billion in 1985.  \n',earn
'Sony Corp SNE.T group net income is expected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31 from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen, if the yen&#127;dollar rate remains at the present level, managing director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference.     Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending March 31, as its financial year will be changed to run from April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.     Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550 billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said.     The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yen in the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct.     The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen\'s recent appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.     The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar, reducing the company\'s total sales in the three month period by 40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.     Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 units in the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, while Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000 from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000 from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from 1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one mln due to lower exports to China.     Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said. Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three months compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.     Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total production in 1990 from the present 20 pct.     Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month period is estimated at around 17 billion yen, down 33 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 400 billion, down 12 pct.     Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April 1 1987, he added. The company made 41.9 billion yen group net profit in the year ended November 31 1986, down 42.6 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 1,325 billion, down 6.7 pct.  \n',earn

'Spar Aerospace Ltd, reporting a sharply lower 1986 profit, said it anticipated solid profit and revenue growth during the next five years.     \"Looking to the longer term, Spar is confident that its continuing concentration on advanced robotics, satellite-based communications and electro-optical defense systems will lead to significant growth in revenues and earnings over the next five years,\" the company said.

Spar added that lower development costs in the communications group and a return to normal operations in gears and transmissions and aviation services \"will remove a serious drain on profits\" this year.     It attributed its reduced 1986 earnings to communications group losses resulting from continued heavy investment in new products and market development, a four-month strike at its Toronto plants and delays in receipt of authorization from customers to start work on new programs.  \n',earn
'US Sprint, the 50-50 telephone venture of GTE Corp GTE and United Telecommunications Inc UT set up last June, is optimistic despite expecting to report a net loss of about 500 mln dlrs this year.      David M. Holland, president of US Sprint\'s Dallas-based Southwest Division, tolds in an interview that he did not know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreed that for the year the company should have about the same results as last year when it lost \"about 500 mln dlrs.\"      He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrs over \"two plus years\" to set up its network.      Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mln dlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in order to lease its lines.      He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optic telephone line are now \"in the ground,\" and 7,000 miles are operable.      By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company\'s subscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (instead of leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of the second quarter.     Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses along microscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and more economical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic line the diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of information as a copper cable 20 feet in diameter.      \"By the end of the year, we will have the capacity to carry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls,\" Holland said.     He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S. long distance market, with MCI Communications Corp MCIC about 10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct.      Holland said Sprint\'s rates, which were 50 pct lower than ATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephone exchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all the companies have equal access. He said the company was cutting back its advertising by about 30 pct this year.      At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its total number of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 to last January.     \"We\'ve captured the fiber high ground, shown the importance of it,\" he said.      Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said he believed ATT \"should be given some flexibility, but should be regulated on pricing plans.\"      \"They\'re so dominant in the market place,\" he said, adding that ATT should be deregulated when \"there is true competition in the marketplace.\"      \"It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money,\" he said, adding, \"maybe two to four years out, it\'s hard to say.\"     Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint\'s two owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, such as the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure on them to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings.      \"They are two excellent partners who have stated time and time again their support of US Sprint,\" he said, adding that he was \"amazed\" at industry talk that the two companies might be arguing. \"There\'s no evidence of that,\" he said.      He said Sprint\'s progress in such areas as revenues, number of customers and construction was on track, even \"ahead in many areas.\"     Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprint currently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in 90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988.     \"We want to be in every country that ATT serves,\" he said.     He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico but was working on it.      He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint, the forerunner of US Sprint, had been broken off by the September 1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation\'s telephone network.  \n',earn
'Standard Bank Investment Corp Ltd (SPRJ.J) chairman Henri de Villiers said he could not predict profits for the bank this year because of South Africa\'s continuing political unrest.     De Villiers also warned in the annual report that \"failing prompt and decisive political action, South Africa faces a future of violent deadlock between different racial and political groupings.\"      He said South Africa\'s future economic prospects are \"clouded by political and social issues and in the absence of evidence that these are being positively addressed I am unable to offer an earnings forecast for 1987.\"     Standard Bank, 39 pct owned by Standard Chartered PLC  STCH.L, London, previously reported that 1986 net income rose by 13.8 pct to 209.0 mln rand.

'Standard Chartered Plc STCH.L, faced with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and an ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted its bad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said.     Barber said in a statement on the bank\'s 1986 results that bad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific, stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985.     Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in the specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Tax breaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while 71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision.     In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for 1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Total pre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985.     \"The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, on top of the normal level of provisioning,\" Barber said.     He said, \"the decision was also taken to build up loan loss reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for general provisions for commercial and cross border risks.\"     Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacific region made \"a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits.\"     He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses was \"well maintained, although the reported result was affected by cross border debt provisioning,\" while Californian subsidiary Union Bank \"showed continued growth.\"     \"Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned in excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued,\" he said.     Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off a takeover bid by Lloyds Bank LLOY.L last year, strengthened its capital resources during that year to just over three billion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.     Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primary capital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said.  \n',earn

'Swire Pacific Ltd SWPC.HKG expects continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees problems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said.     He told reporters:\"1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire Properties expects further good results both from properties under development for sale and from its investment property portfolio.\"     He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78 billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.     Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd CAPH.HKG.     Miles said the company will use the money to develop its business, primarily in Hong Kong.     Swire\'s stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from 70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25 pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the enlarged capital to the state-owned China International Trust and Investment Corp. Cathay last week reported its 1986 profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.     Miles said despite last year\'s rapid expansion in Cathay\'s flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.     He said Cathay\'s growth last year was the result of \"a marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with savings in fuel costs.\"     \"At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable for the rest of this year,\" he said, \"though there might be a bit of increase later this year.\'\'     Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service operations, even though the marine sector is generally depressed. \"Obviously the marine industry is not getting any better,\" he said.     The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year.     Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm but said the firm has no available land for a major housing project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong island now near completion.

'Swire Pacific Ltd SWPC.HKG is likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating profits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in its aviation and property businesses, share analysts said.     Analysts polled bys estimated after-tax profits from operations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs compared with 1.23 billion in 1985.     They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd CAPH.HKG unit last May.     Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985.     Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend for its \"A\" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985.     Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the company\'s net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits, analysts said.     The company\'s aviation division consists of its majority stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd, which is also 25 pct owned by Cathay.     Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel costs and greater traffic.     Swire\'s share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the flotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has since slipped to 50.23 pct.     Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs.     Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd, estimates Swire\'s profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs.     \"Much depends on properties,\" said Measor. \"And they did a lot better in the second half of the year.\"     Estimates of profits from the firm\'s wholly owned Swire Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985.     Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs for the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the same 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm\'s properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential development and two luxury housing projects.     Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in second-half 1986.     During the year property prices continued to rise as more people bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates, analysts said.     \"At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling at 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year ago,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.     Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not provide income until the first stage is completed next year.     The company also sold three properties and a part interest in a proposed hotel development, which should result in extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James Capel (Far East) Ltd.     Swire\'s trading and manufacturing operations are expected to earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10 mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.  \n',earn
'Swissair SWSZ.Z reported a 5.8 pct drop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that, in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut its payout to 33 francs per share from 38.     President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would at least equal last year\'s figure, but said much depended on outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate.     The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on Swissair\'s core flying business last year, against a profit of 27 mln francs the previous year, he said.     The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68 mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20 mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s.     Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276 mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation.     Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45 mln francs supplementary depreciation.     Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc.     While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc against other European currencies.     \"Income and profit generated by services to these countries shrank by a very substantial margin,\" he said. \"Exchange rate trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other airlines.\"  \n',earn

In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs.     Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total\'s refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France RAFF.PA, told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation.

'Problems in the farmbelt and oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall income for U.S. banks in a quarter century, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) said.     The nation\'s 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8 billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985\'s record 18.1 billion dlrs.     The total was still the second highest ever reported, but it was the first time income had not grown since 1961.     The figures reflected a radical split in the health of banks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.     In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, while one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.     Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDIC said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles it planned to issue.     \"I don\'t remember a time when there was such a clear distinction by geographic area,\" FDIC Chairman William Seidman told reporters.     He said that while the figures were not good, they showed the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but with regional differences in economic performance.     Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as many as failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubted the pace would continue.      On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208 billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in the number of new problem banks in all regions except the Southwest, Seidman said.     Banks\' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from a year ago.     Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDIC said.     Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil\'s moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.     He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be expected.     But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger, Seidman said.  \n',earn

'Ultramar Plc UMAR.L said that while its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point of view, several special charges adversely affected results.     Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstream operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and downstream operations also affected in the first half by large losses on inventories.     But margins improved in the second half and in particular refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good recovery.     The company was commenting on results that showed a net loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in 1985.     The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company\'s liquid natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership of Gulf Canada\'s marketing assets.     Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a 13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its U.S. Flag shipping operation.     The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic prices would strengthen over the longer term.     Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.     In the meantime, Ultramar\'s objectives were to improve profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while strengthening core businesses and developing a sound operational and financial base.     Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis.

'Unilever Plc UN.A and NV group reported improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said.     He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years.     Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he noted.     But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic acquisitions taking place \"from time to time,\" he said.     The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.     Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond\'s Inc CBM.N for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution.     However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the company\'s operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.     Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987.     The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with Unilever NV\'s rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc\'s increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with the change in attributable profit.     Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said that there was no target date for completing the process.     He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which operates outside Unilever\'s core activities.     In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business, considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.     However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs of its Surf detergents.  \n',earn

Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period, making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year.     Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at January 1, 1987.

The company said that its 1986 performance was best reflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln from 221 mln in 1985.     Catena\'s increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover of Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business profile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo dealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a trading and industrial company.     In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB.

'Audi AG NSUG.F, the 99 pct owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, said profit in 1986 fell by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record 221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous year.     Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.     He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified amount from 1985\'s record levels.     Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from 9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10 billion this year.     Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi would ensure VW got a share of profits.     Audi\'s entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years VW had received 80 pct of Audi\'s earnings as a dividend.     Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About alleged \"sudden acceleration\" of some of its Audi 5000 models.     As reported, Audi\'s sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct to 59,800 last year.     Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom out in 1987.     Audi\'s worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.     Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000, but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180 in 1985.     Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to 57,000.     Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen compared with 1985\'s 392,000.     Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to further new hiring of employees.     At the end of 1986 Audi\'s workforce stood at a record 39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985.  \n',earn
'Dutch dairy and general foods manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV WESS.AS, said it is planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong profit growth over the next 10 years.      Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the presentation of Wessanen\'s 1986 report he already expected 1987 first quarter profits to show an increase.     The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985.     This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar\'s guilder value, van Driel said.     Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985 level of 3.20 guilders.     Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders.     US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover, compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide.     Van Driel said the company would continue an active takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit.     He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China.     He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln guilders and would if necessary make new share issues.     Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln dlrs. He said Balanced Foods and Green\'s Dairy, taken over late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs which was not included in the 1986 account.     All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13 pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to this growth was the successful introduction of new products, which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US acquisitions, van Driel said.     Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986 turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said.     The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich, Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said.     Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles for the company to raise capital for future expansion.     He estimated that 33 pct of the company\'s shares were in foreign hands.     The company\'s 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step, van Driel said without elaborating.     Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which produces around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospects for its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said.  \n',earn
'Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale WELG.F said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLB International SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6 mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier.     WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to WestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.     The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record profit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to changed market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of 1987 developed positively, it added.     WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for international credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in 1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.     Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln in 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from 10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that credit business redemptions were not fully offset by new lending.     The statement said WestLB International\'s business with private customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.     This development was aided by cooperation between the bank and the savings banks in the West German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.

This largely related to its Vamgas Ltd unit, non-allowable exchange losses and tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project not recognised in the accounts.     Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full year sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of the Shelf project, against six month sales in 1985.     Offsetting this was a 23 pct fall in the Cooper Basin gas and liquids revenue of its 50.6 pct-owned Vamgas unit.

'Bond Corp Holdings Ltd BONA.S and Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corp ATLC.MN are still holding talks on a bail-out package for the troubled mining firm, an Atlas statement said.     Atlas, the Philippines\' biggest copper producer, said it had been hit by depressed world copper prices. It reported a net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986, compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.     The company said it had been able to cut its losses because its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu started in the second half of 1986.     Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition by Bond of the company\'s existing bank loans and their restructuring into a gold loan.     A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas\' total loans of 275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.

'Borg-Warner BOR Corp, facing an unwanted offer from GAF Corp GAF, agreed to a 4.23 billion dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc.     Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the new company, AV Holdings Corp, will begin a 48.50 dlr per share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of Borg-Warner common stock.     The offer will be followed by a merger in which each remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and 54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated discount debentures.     As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said members of management do not plan to participate in the transaction, but they will retain their positions with the company.     A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner\'s shares.     GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.     Borg-Warner\'s spokeswoman said the company still plans to sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.     Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.     In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.     James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, said, \"We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its strong presence in the Chicago community.\"     Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer, which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing arrangements.     The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or 51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.     Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.     Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the financing required to complete the transaction.     The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying cash interest after five years.     The debentures will be redeemable at the company\'s option for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at 102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.     The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before maturity.     Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50 dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.     The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right, effective immediately.  \n',acq

'CSR Ltd CSRA.S intends to proceed with its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd MNRA.S despite the counter-bid from Equiticorp Tasman Ltd (ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert tolds.     ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier\'s issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative. This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR\'s proposed bid.     The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.      Herbert said Britain\'s Redland Plc RDLD.L, which holds just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and had told CSR it is not a seller.     He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.     The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.     CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.      ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond describing it as a long term investment.     ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is a leader in building materials, Herbert said.     \"We fit better with Monier,\" he said.     CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves into energy several years ago.     Asked what he thought ETL\'s bid sought to achieve, Herbert said: \"I\'m puzzled as to what Hawkins\' strategy is. One has to wonder if Monier is the main target.\"      Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.     Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.     The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.     Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.      ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the negotiations foundered on the price.     Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not think ETL\'s intervention would flush out a full Redland bid although Monier\'s ultimate fate rests in its hands.     \"Redland is still in the driving seat,\" said Tim Cohen of Ord Minnett Ltd, adding that Redland would be happier having CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.     Monier\'s independent directors have recommended ETL\'s bid.   \n',acq

'Japan\'s little-known Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with, political analysts said.     MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S. And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians, they said.     \"The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,\" said one diplomatic source.     \"They are a potent political force,\" the diplomatic source said.     But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts said.     \"The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized,\" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida. \"Suddenly they\'re standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense, they\'re at a loss (as to) how to face the situation.\"     Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain\'s Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan\'s lucrative overseas telephone business.     The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now monopolizes the business.     It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists.     The ministry\'s stance has outraged both London, which has threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan\'s failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market.     Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan\'s car telephone and satellite communications market.     Much of MPT\'s new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates.     \"What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place,\" said James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc.     A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPT\'s authority, analysts said.     \"With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto legal framework,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell Whitten.     Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT\'s influence, the analysts said.     \"Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance of MPT,\" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group, he added.     The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System, analysts said.     MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal Savings System\'s ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks, they said.     Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT\'s obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized the ministry as feudal.     Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.     But many of the ministry\'s actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain, several analysts said.     \"The United States is really the odd man out,\" Abegglen said. \"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable view,\" he said.  \n',acq
'Elders IXL Ltd ELXA.S says it is happy to leave preferences shares of brewer Carling O\'Keefe Ltd outstanding after an undisclosed bidder made an offer to acquire all of Carling\'s outstanding preferred stock.

'Entertainment Marketing Inc EM said it has made an offer to the board of Crazy Eddie Inc to acquire all outstanding shares of Crazy Eddie Inc for eight dlrs a share in cash.

According to Entertainment, its company and its chairman own about 4.3 pct of Crazy Eddie\'s currently outstanding shares.

'A quickly growing Texas-based distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs for Crazy Eddie Inc crzy, the leading New York City electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its founder has bid.     The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc em for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.     Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer electronics, the nation\'s biggest, at a time the fortunes of electronics retailers have sagged.     The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.     \"I have mixed feelings,\" said analyst Dennis Telzrow of Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. \"On the one hand it\'s probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?\"     \"It\'s a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,\" said analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a Minneapolis brokerage. \"Electronics retailing is very management concentrated; they\'d want to keep Crazy Eddie\'s management in place.\"     Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie\'s 31.3 million shares, it may be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its 7-dlr-a-share offer.     Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high 4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share in over-the- counter trading.      Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie\'s shares.     A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company\'s board has taken no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He would not comment on the new offer.     Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to consumers by cable television.     In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to 87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.     Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer, Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to assist in financing the balance.     Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same amount.     Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday to 9.50.  \n',acq

'Equiticorp Tasman Ltd (ETL) said it will offer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of Monier Ltd MNRA.S, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a share bid by CSR Ltd CSRA.S.     Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.     As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by Friday.     It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as foreign because of its New Zealand base.     The ETL cash offer values Monier\'s issued capital of 156.28 mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.     Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.     ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.     ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the shareholding in Monier was a long term investment.     ETL and its Feltex International Ltd associate have targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion and Monier fits well with this aim, he added.     Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.     He also said Monier will not now proceed with the one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.     As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex put and call option deal with Monier\'s major shareholder, Redland Plc RDLD.L, which gives Redland the choice of accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to 50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.     CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland taking the second option, resulting in the two companies running Monier as a joint venture.

'The French government\'s privatisation program, which began late last year, has earned the French State about 52 billion francs to date, the Finance Ministry said.

The Ministry said in a communique that the returns included banking group Societe Generale SGEN.PA, which began its two-week public flotation last Monday.

Other companies to be sold to the private sector in the near future are television network TF-1 later this month and banking group Cie Financiere de Suez FSPP.PA in the autumn.

Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder, William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the transaction.     Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150 mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.     Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be reached for comment.     E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel Inc MAT and the Ingersoll newspaper chain.

But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn down Greyhound\'s request to begin operating Trailways immediately.     \"The department has just begun to receive relevant information on Trailways\' financial condition and is in the process of assessing the correctness of the company\'s allegations,\" acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule said in comments submitted to the ICC.     Greyhound announced June 19 that it wanted the ICC to let it begin operating Trailways immediately while continuing to evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems.     Greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of Trailways\' terminals, buses and garages.     The two companies said in papers filed with the ICC that Trailways \"could collapse in a matter of days.\"     They said Trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs, with another six mln dlrs due June 30.     The suppliers, they said, could force Trailways into bankruptcy \"at any time.\"     Trailways also owes a consortium of banks 76 mln dlrs, and the consortium has threatened to call the loan if Trailways fails to pay the interest due June 30, they said.  \n',acq

'President Reagan\'s nominee as top policeman for the nation\'s securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets.     David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.     If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.     The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.     The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing.     The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street\'s most successful stock speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading.     But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in  securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some U.S. securities markets.     At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.     And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.     Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the SEC\'s ability to enforce U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.     Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies, eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency\'s review of hostile corporate takeovers.     Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.     In line with the views of other top administration officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations.     The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency\'s enforcement agenda during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.     Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission\'s current priorities.     The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.     The agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies, investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.     The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency, meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone.     By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the White House.     Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms.     The agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities.     It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.     Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to become the nation\'s 35th president.     Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon\'s first term and was Reagan\'s director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.  \n',acq

'Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.     Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers, Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.     \"We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would insure that takeovers are properly financed,\" he said.     Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, Proxmire said.     In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC.     Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts.     Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days.     His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer.     To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced.     The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers.     Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.     He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve\'s 50 pct margin requirements.     The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.     \"When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it,\" Proxmire said.     Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment.     He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.     Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.     He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this year.  \n',acq

'Corporate mergers and acquisitions in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had only a modest effect on the metropolitan area\'s economy, a leading business-backed organization said.     The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding communities had not.     Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but another 21 firms were added to the list.     Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco. During the period, only six located in the city achieved Fortune 500 status.     Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously hurt the economic climate of northern California.     However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were created during the period.     At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest of the United States and California.     Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news conference that the region had difficulties in persuading companies to locate there because of a fragmented local political system.     But he said that because of the amenities of living in San Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other metropolitan area.     \"It\'s a great place to run a business,\" he added, \"but it\'s a hell of a place to do business with government.\"     The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the restructuring activity.     Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp; Cooke and Rolm.     Companies that grew enough during the period to make the Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis, McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.

'A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) SANM.MN to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources in the Philippine food and brewery company said.     A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC\'s outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former chairman of both SMC and UCPB.     Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.     Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB\'s plans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach of fiduciary duties.\"     The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a government nominee on the company\'s board.     De los Angeles, who represents SMC\'s minority stockholders, asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by the company\'s board.     On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company\'s retained earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends.     De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt to equity ratio. He quoted SMC\'s chief financial director Ramon del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.     In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.     De los Angeles\' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC\'s Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp for a down payment on the shares. The loan assumption was again ratified by last week\'s board meeting.     An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by April 15.     \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said in a statement.     \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the government\'s expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added.     A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on Cojuangco\'s court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial.\"     Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United States citizen.     The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \"A\" shares, which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \"B\" shares which are available to foreign buyers.     SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by the A.Soriano group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.     The sale was aborted when Diaz\'s Presidential Commission on Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend announced last June.     \"We have no objection to Soriano buying the \"B\" shares,\" Diaz tolds. \"But everything is on hold now.\"     The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company\'s annual stockholders\' meeting, scheduled for May 14.     San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in 1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of 700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.  \n',acq
'Santos Ltd STOS.S said it would buy Total Exploration Australia Pty Ltd from Total Holdings (Australia) Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Total-Cie Francaise des Petroles TPN.PA.     Total Exploration had interests ranging from 18.75 to 25 pct in four blocks in permit ATP259P in south-west Queensland, Santos said in a statement.     The Santos group stakes will rise to between 52.5 and 70 pct of the four ATP259P blocks as a result of the purchase. The price was not disclosed.     Santos said a number of oil and gas fields have been discovered in the Total Exploration areas and that it regards them as having very good prospects for further discoveries.     Total\'s reserves amount to 75 billion cubic feet of gas and 5.5 mln barrels of oil and condensate, it said.

'The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a takeover attempt by Campeau Corp.     In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau\'s takeover offer.     Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.     On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had urged rejection of Campeau\'s Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said.     Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied\'s SEC filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.     Securities law requires takeover target companies to promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.     The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct of Allied\'s stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at thwarting Campeau, the SEC said.     Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an amended SEC filing, the agency charged.     Allied\'s first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct 3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint said.     DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or 48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes after it dropped its hostile tender offer.     The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.     The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal tender offer.     But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.     In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern, the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.     Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.  \n',acq

'Dutch insurer Stad Rotterdam Anno 1720 N.V. ASRN.AS said from July 1 it will own 20 pct of the shares of Europeesche Verzekering Maatschappij N.V., a fully-owned unit of Swiss insurer Union Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft.     Stad Rotterdam chairman Lucas van Leeuwen tolds it may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies are found to be sufficiently compatible.     Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact Europeesche made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at below the shares\' intrinsic value. He gave no precise sum.     The Europeesche, which specialises in travel and recreation insurance, had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986.     Stad Rotterdam\'s premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion guilders, making it the fifth largest Dutch insurer.     Europeesche made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985, which narrowed to 4.5 mln guilders in 1986, van Leeuwen said.

'Sumitomo Bank Ltd SUMI.T is certain to lose its status as Japan\'s most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.     Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in October.     But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu tolds he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position.     \"We\'ll be back in position in first place within three years,\" Komatsu said in an interview.     He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo\'s profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand Sumitomo\'s branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak.     But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off.     Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank\'s large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch.     The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves.     \"They\'ve made bold moves to put everything in place. Now it\'s largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson.     Among Sumitomo\'s problems are limits placed on its move to enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.     Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.     \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.     But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.     \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so, we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three years, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.     Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home.     Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan\'s version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial from investment banking.     But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities.     \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust bank related. That\'s the kind of deregulation we want.\"     Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.     He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.      The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon, following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.     But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.     \"We don\'t want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years,\" he said.     Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.     The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.     \"It\'s (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said Kleinwort\'s Smithson.     \"After that, it\'s a question of absorbing and juggling around. It will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong.\"  \n',acq

'A takeover battle began today for debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd DMP.MO as TransCanada PipeLines Ltd TRP.TO announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.     Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd IMO.A which is 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp XON.N, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd CP.N and British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L.     Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another proposal from \"a substantial company\" and discussions with a third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a statement.     The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada\'s bid, but did not identify the companies involved in talks.     TransCanada, Canada\'s largest natural gas pipeline operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which would own and operate Dome\'s assets. TransCanada said the offer is to Dome management, not to shareholders.     Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada, totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed. It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.     Dome\'s statement said the TransCanada announcement \"violated the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered into with prospective purchasers\" and was apparently timed to prevent Dome from considering other proposals.     It said the TransCanada bid \"seems to require favourable and substantial taxation concessions from the federal and provincial governments.\" But Dome added that its management and financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.     TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he was surprised at the vehemence of Dome\'s statement and denied that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. \"I find (Dome\'s statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce it,\" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the other bidders, or the terms of other offers.     Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

'Japan\'s cabinet approved a plan to help financially-troubled aluminium ventures in Indonesia and Brazil, an official at the Ministry of International and Trade Industry (MITI) said.     Japan will invest 24 billion yen in PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium in addition to the 68.3 billion yen already invested in the company. The government and private interests will equally share the additional investment, he said.     They will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen in new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in Brazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested.     The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct, the official said.     Interest rates on loans by Japan\'s private banks to the two projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the current seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to be reached, industry sources said.     Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billion yen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32 billion yen to the company.  This will raise Indonesia\'s investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct.     The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an additional 6.5 billion yen in Albras, in which investment now totals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51 pct, the official said.     The sources said the rescue programs for the two projects were larger than earlier expected, reflecting Japan\'s desire to help develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and to stabilise sources of aluminium.     Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its aluminium demand, which totals some 1.8 mln tonnes a year, they said.  \n',alum
'Venezuela has obtained more than 300 mln dlrs in financing for industrial projects and increased its lines of credit for import financing, finance minister Manuel Azpurua said.     \'We can say that we are achieving the recuperation of credit, but that cannot be done overnight,\' Azpurua said in a television interview.

'Phelps Dodge Corp is prepared to make another large non-copper acquisition and a deal could be struck in the near future, chairman G. Robert Durham said.     Durham tolds the company was examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any. Any acquisition must have a different economic cycle to copper, he said.

The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and then match earnings between copper and non-copper operations.     The company could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs to buy another non-copper firm, Durham said, citing 100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.  \n',copper

'South Yemen is planning a major oil pipeline system to be completed in 18-months time to start exports at a initial rate of 100,000 barrels per day, (bpd) the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said.     MEES said government approval for the export pipeline followed a visit to Aden by a high ranking delegation from the Soviet Union, which will help South Yemen construct the line     The engineering studies for the pipeline are nearly finished and construction is expected to start early next year, the industry newsletter said.     The pipeline will run about 170-200 kms (105-125 miles) from Shabwa oilfields to a coastal terminal at Bir \'Ali on the Gulf of Aden, MEES said.      MEES said the Soviet firm Technoexport, which is developing oilfileds for South Yemen, has substantially increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity.     The discovery of commercial quaotities of oil was confirmed by Technoexport earlier this year in three structures in the Shabwa region in the Northwestern part of the country, 200 kms east of North Yemen\'s Alif oilfield.  \n',crude
'The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc\'s RTZL.L RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible, the Press Association reported.     The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax Commissioners that any such provision was a capital expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible. The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of abandoning a rig.     An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible from corporation tax payable.     It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he said.     Oil analysts said that RTZ\'s assumption of liability was shared by the industry as a whole.     The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were built into the accounts, one analyst added.  \n',crude

'Dutch insurer AEGON NV AEGN.AS reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits for 1987.     Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.     Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly due to its life insurance business.     Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and higher personal risks.     Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.     In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change in accounting for U.S. Annuities.     AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal investment influences that it should be accounted differently from the more traditional insurances.     This change in accounting practice and another change to account for profits made on fixed interest investments, resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln guilders.     AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The Hague.     In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.     Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these costs and made only a small contribution to the group\'s profits.     AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill for Monumental Corp.     AEGON\'s net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December 1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.   \n',earn

'Citibank A/S CCI.N, the Norwegian subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.     Citibank\'s Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad tolds, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic slump in Norway following last year\'s plunge in oil prices.     Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in Norway since 1985.     Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway\'s second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would make profit this year.     Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.

'Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration.     Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.     Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe\'s leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986, said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.     The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S., Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe, where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.     Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.     Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery El Aguila S.A. to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.     Heineken\'s Spanish activities should start yielding profit next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.     Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed West German market -- Europe\'s biggest beer market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important point,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.     \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German market, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very regionalized.      Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term.      He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.     Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total 1986 sales.     On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities.     To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which had sold successfully, Coebergh said.     Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.     Chairman Heineken said the company\'s seven year efforts to penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.     But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken\'s market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western money.  \n',earn

Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.

'National Westminster Bank USA said higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported a year earlier.     The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.     Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with 91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.     Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0 mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.     Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.     The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced by about 4.9 mln dlrs.

'Texaco Inc TX said its decision to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code will not affect the majority of its businesses.     It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its 32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property, plant and equipment, were free of the action.     Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are affected, it said.     But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.     Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL.     Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985 judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil\'s 1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp GTY. The bond almost matches the damages awarded against Texaco.     Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin to attach its assets to secure the judgment.     Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut Texaco\'s bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to the Texas courts.     Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all Texaco\'s obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of the Pennzoil lawsuit.     \"Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond issue and the larger dispute failed,\" James Kinnear, Texaco\'s president and chief executive officer, told reporters.     Kinnear said Pennzoil\'s disclosure in court papers on Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.     Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not sell any assets, Kinnear said.     Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under 11.1 billion dlrs, he added.     Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for bankruptcy.     He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a confidentiality agreement between the two companies. \"Texaco told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go to bankruptcy court,\" Jamail said.     Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco\'s assets were ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.  \n',earn

'Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud.     A spokesman said VW\'s supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards.     VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.     When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the company\'s new preference shares.     Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. \"Anything else would be more than a surprise,\" one said.     Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at around three billion marks at end-1985.  \n',earn

'Losses for Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW spokesman said.     The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on 1986 business, despite the provision.     One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an \"upper limit.\"     VW said in a statement following today\'s supervisory board meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing company.     VW has said computer programs were erased and documents were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign currency losses were not completed.     VW\'s former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having evaded justice.     Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985 profits. VW\'s group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares, which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.     VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5 billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985, since the new capital was in preference shares.     The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly less than three billion marks.  \n',earn

'Venezuela\'s cabinet approved a new exchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at 14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously, Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.     Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the measure is \"fundamental to conserving the economic and financial strength of the petroleum industry.\"      He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state oil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its problem of working capital and implement investment plans, estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when the measure would become effective.    Venezuela\'s oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.    The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more government debt bonds.                             PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust fund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed in government bonds.   According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank, the BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries by repurchasing the bonds.     PDVSA\'s contribution to the treasury last year was 44.480 billion bolivars. It foreign earnings for oil and petrochemcial sales were 8.023 billion dlrs.  \n',money-fx
