'Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich is considering calling a special legislative session to consider amendments to the state\'s anti-takeover statute, according to the governor\'s office.     A spokesman for the governor said nothing will be decided today, but said the governor will evaluate later whether to call a special session in the next few days.    The governor\'s office said the possible action was triggered by a proposal by Dayton-Hudson Corp DH, which has been the subject of takeover rumors. A spokesman for the governor said the company proposed several amendments to Perpich designed to make any takeover attempt in the state more difficult.             Dayton-Hudson suggested amendments be passed and instituted by next Friday, the spokesperson said.     Press reports in Minneapolis newspapers this morning quoted several legislators as saying they were inclined to support legislation that would help Dayton-Hudson, according to a governor\'s spokesperson.    Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe was quoted as saying he would be inclined to support any action that would help the company, the spokesperson said.    Robert Vanasek, the House speaker designate, was quoted in the Minneapolis Star and Tribune as saying, \"We are taking their (Dayton-Hudson) concerns very seriously and we are going to do what we can to help.\"  \n',acq
'A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd DMP.MO by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd TRP.TO may short-circuit Dome\'s restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.     Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire.     Analysts said TransCanada\'s bid signals Dome\'s debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome\'s debt plan.     Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations.     TransCanada\'s proposal \"amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto.     Calgary-based Dome\'s restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.     \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary.     TransCanada\'s announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said.     The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added.     \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said.     Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada\'s announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,\" he said.     Dome does not consider TransCanada\'s proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility\'s announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.     Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada\'s.     Gowland said TransCanada\'s offer is probably a fair price for the company\'s 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.     However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome\'s debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada\'s proposed offer.  \n',acq
'Sweden\'s Sandvik AB SVIK.ST and Diamant Boart SA of Belgium, in which Societe Generale de Belgique BELB.BR holds an indirect 52 pct stake, have finalised negotiations on merging oil and gas drilling tool activities, officials of both companies said.     Staffan Paues, President of the new Brussels-based joint venture company Diamant Boart Stratabit SA (DBS), told a news conference that the merged firm would be able to offer products for all types of drilling operations.     He said there were already signs that a slow recovery from recession was under way in the oil and gas industries.     \"Stability in oil prices should lead to renewed investment\" Paues said.     DBS, which Paues said began operations today, brings together Sandvik\'s wholly-owned U.S. Subsidiary Strata Bit Corp of Houston and Diamant Boart\'s petroleum activities in Europe, North America, the Middle and Far East and Africa.     Paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall in oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back exploration activities. Officials said the complementary character of the two firms\' operations was a further reason.  \n',acq

'A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its crude oil without breaching OPEC accords.     Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company\'s Petroleum Community magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations. \"The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions...And take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production,\" he said.    \"The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market,\" he added.     OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.     Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline OPEC showed.     Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was ADNOC\'s most difficult ever but \"a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment.\"     He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.     In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.  \n',crude
'Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.     December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.     \"Fundamentals are awful,\" said Philip Lambert, analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln bpd, little changed from September levels.     Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. and International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September production at 18.5 mln bpd.     The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday\'s hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian, in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.     The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.     Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S. Attack, analysts said.     They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.     Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities, analysts said.     But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.     Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew, said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.     \"The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response. Today\'s action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,\" Pyne said.     Kleinwort Grieveson\'s Lambert said the U.S. Strike was \"a responsible retaliation,\" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict.     Chase Manhattan\'s Nicol took a different view, however.     He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation.     The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.     The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinburger.     Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower, analysts and traders said.  \n',crude

The decline in production in the nine months to end-March reflected mainly a sharp dip early in the fiscal year, when low oil prices and high marginal excise rates led to a reduction of output from Bass Strait, department figures in its Major Energy Statistics publication show.

The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a U.S.- flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday.

'A North Sea oil find announced by Chevron Corp\'s CHV Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate a new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln barrels, industry analysts said.     Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K. Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API crude oil from the tertiary \"Alba\" sand through a three-inch surface choke.     \"The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320 mln barrels,\" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson and Co tolds.     He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25 pct.     Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be plugged and a sidetrack drilled.     \"The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs up,\" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.     Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well showed that it flows well.     \"Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low, it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be recovered,\" Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew tolds.     However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the analysts\' reserve estimates. They said that without further research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not disclose any reserve figures.     Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial and developed, there would be a ready local market for the heavy crude it produced.     \"Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a lot narrower today,\" Osborne said.

'A Colombian group announced the suspension of its bombings of oil pipelines pending the government\'s levy of a social tax on foreign petroleum companies and an 800 mln dlrs fine on the Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.     There was no indication the government would meet the conditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army (ELN).     According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carried out 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986.     The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have caused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage.     In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults.     Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per day in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigating Occidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion.     If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up to 800 mln dlrs. The ELN demands the government charge the penalty.  \n',crude
'Norway is expected to seek a compromise solution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S STAT.OL (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firm will operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said.     The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the field\'s operator through the development phase, with Statoil taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.     Oil Minister Arne Oeien tolds the government had today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision had been taken and several questions remained unresolved.     It was unlikely the government would announce its decision on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday\'s cabinet meeting and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies, the sources added.     This spring Norway\'s state-owned oil company Statoil exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by Conoco.

'Rep. Mike Synar said today that while President Reagan is ready to use military force to protect Kuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-prepared at home to deal with a new energy crisis.     Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S. participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing program of the International Energy Agency.     The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was formed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal with any future oil cutoff.     Synar said, \"the president is prepared to take military action to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our nation for the next energy crisis.\"     Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil, increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar, who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action in a previous IEA test, said the United States successfully advocated a test limited to training participants in oil sharing procedures and the system\'s mechanical aspects.  \n',crude
'Crude oil netback values in complex refineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. last Friday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore, according to calculations bys Pipeline.     The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S. relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly gasoline, and support from crude oil prices.     Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe rose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices there. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel or three pct from the previous week.

'A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab allies, Western diplomats in the region said.     U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf in response to a missile strike on the American-registered Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.     \"We consider the matter closed,\" he said, a signal the U.S. administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.     Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action would endanger American interests.     Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran\'s War Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a \"crushing blow.\"     \"The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely,\" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.     Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.     Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.     Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they said.     \"The ball is in Iran\'s court now. It\'s up to Tehran to respond one way or the other,\" a diplomat said.     President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American countermeasures if the military escalation continued.     Western diplomats and military sources in the area said shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act the United States could have taken once it had decided to retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans and Kuwaitis on Iran.     \"It\'s interesting that they chose something in international waters because it doesn\'t implicate any other nation,\" one diplomat said. \"This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf Arab states, particularly Kuwait.\"     Commented another diplomat: \"Kuwait must be happy that the U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked on its doorstep.\"     One source said of the attack on the oil platform: \"They managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the least nuisance to everybody.\"     A diplomat commented: \"They were very clever in the place they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn\'t devastated anything because it wasn\'t working in the first place.\"     A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke: \"This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up ...

'Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil output on May 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring Colombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said.

About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some 50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said.     Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the earthquake.     The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in Colombia, the starting point of Columbia\'s pipeline to the Pacific ocean port of Temuco.

CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to neighbouring Colombia.     Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an earthquake damaged the country\'s main pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific port of Balao.

It was built to allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5 by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,     Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.     The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling will begin in September.     \"The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only for this emergency period but for the next five years, with possibility of an extension.

Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.     Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.     \"The area could contain potentially recoverable oil resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides almost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production,\" Hodel said.     He said production from the new section could begin about the time Prudhoe Bay production begins to decline in 2000 without endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area.  \n',crude

The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group of five heads of delegation established by the 77th (extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 to undertake the necessary contacts with those countries.     \"The conference observed the continued fall in the value of the U.S. Dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied and reported to the next meeting of the conference.\"      \"The conference discussed the appointment of the secretary general and decided to discuss the matter again in its next ordinary meeting.     \"The conference extended the term of office of Fadhil al-Chalabi as deputy secretary general for a period of one year from October 7, 1987.     \"The next ordinary meeting of the conference will be convened in Vienna on December 9, 1987.\"   \n',crude
'OPEC\'s agreement to limit output to 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost spot prices and enable the group to raise its official reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current 18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.     \"Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in January,\" a Japanese refiner said.     The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.     Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for U.K. Brent, traders said.     They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.     \"With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further,\" said a Japanese oil trader.     Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term, having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.     \"You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis, there\'s no reason for prices to go up again today,\" said one international oil trader in Tokyo.     \"But I think if there\'s any sign of a dip, it will be bought back up again pretty quickly,\" he added.     One oil industry analyst concurred, \"There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on.\" He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.     Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices.     Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.     Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd, against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.     Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast.     Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels. \"Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much,\" an oil industry analyst said.  \n',crude

'Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.     One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield, was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.     The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60 metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S. Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.     The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section of the structure remained.     U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S. forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had been caught laying mines.     But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday and the Sea Isle City on Friday.     Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.     Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.     But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result of U.S. intervention and Iran\'s response.     The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a U.S. \"tit-for-tat\" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.     He said with this appraoch America would suffer \"the death of one thousand cuts.\"     But for the United States to grab the initiative militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran\'s harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its shipping must pass, Schuler said.     He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off, Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.     Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.     He said the United States should also threaten to mine and blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a settlement.     Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by invading Iran\'s territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.     Each side has attacked the others\' shipping.  \n',crude

The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres, yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas per day, he said.     \"The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80 km north-west of Bombay, indicates good prospects of both oil and gas. We\'ve decided to drill at least three more wells in there before starting production on a commercial scale.\"     Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshore field, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the last two years.     ONGC produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 ending March, up from 27.51 the previous year. Bombay High accounted for 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before. India\'s total oil output is around 30 mln tonnes.     ONGC has been exploring the Bombay offshore area, developed since the late 1970s, for more oil as production from Bombay High has reached a plateau.  \n',crude
'Indonesia\'s state oil company, Pertamina, has informed its affiliated Japanese companies that crude oil supplies will be 40 pct less than contractual volumes in July, a spokesman for an affiliated company said.     He said the allocations were in line with Indonesia\'s production ceiling under its current OPEC quota, so they might be increased if OPEC ratifies a production rise next week.     Allocations of Indonesia\'s main traded crude, Minas, had been cut by 50 pct and Duri by 38 pct, he said.     Last month contractual volumes were cut by 30 pct.     Contractual volumes assume no production ceiling.     Oil traders said Indonesian grades were already trading above their official selling prices (osp) on the spot market due to strong demand from Japan and the U.S. And tight supplies.

'The Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina has found new offshore oil and gas resources in East Aceh, on the western tip of northern Sumatra, a company spokesman said.     The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1 offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh.     \"Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300 metres within the Baong formation,\" he said.     He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow oil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at 20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke.     \"The well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mln standard cubic feet a day,\" he added.

'Indonesia told the oil industry on Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased expenditure on exploration in return.     President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.     \"In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending production sharing contracts under the present laws,\" Suharto said.     \"Apart from that, the government will keep improving the investment climate in order to accelerate the development of the petroleum industry,\" he said.     Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be renewed before they would invest in further exploration.     \"As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully aware of this situation,\" Subroto said.     \"The government has already made the political decision to entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a selective basis.\"     Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil industry sources say.     Subroto said the government was also working to ease other problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or deep water conditions.     But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now that the oil price had recovered.     President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil industry for the regions in which companies operated.     Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in 1986.     Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation contracts with foreign oil companies.     Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field operations was a government priority. There had been misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry in certain areas, such as when a field is designated commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.     He said the government wanted to finalise contract extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the meantime to maintain its exploration drive.     Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire within 10 years. \"This need in itself is some sort of guarantee that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.\"     Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.     Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.     Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions would be selective, based on how much capital would be invested.  \n',crude

'Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for compensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf oil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.     The lawsuits would be filed with competent international bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.     The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack, he said.     Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.     He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs \"except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence.\" Reacting to Weinberger\'s remark that Washington considered the case closed, Aqazadeh said: \"Iran will also consider the case closed after its retaliatory measure.\" Iranian officials have said their response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests around the world might come under attack.     Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region\'s oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack significantly affecting oil prices.     IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the entrance to the Gulf.     \"If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can either, and this would be to everyone\'s harm,\" the radio quoted him as saying.  \n',crude

'Deregulation of Japan\'s oil industry could mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.     They said the relaxation of controls was now under review by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).     A spokesman for a major firm said, \"Deregulation would bring about a reorganization. If it\'s a by-product of freer competition, we have no choice but to accept it.\"     The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.     The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.     They said deregulation was vital to promote more competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.     \"Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it\'s our turn to see if we can survive cut-throat competition,\" said a source at one major Japanese oil company.     A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, \"We\'ll have a hard time surviving, but that\'s something we must go through.\"     \"In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out further into other lines such as real estate and travel agencies,\" he said.     Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd which had the largest share of refined products sales in the Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining capacity in fiscal 1986.     Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a spokesman for the company said.     Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the efficiency of the industry.     Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to be streamlined further into five refining groups.     \"MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to merge into five to build up their muscles,\" a source said.

'OPEC output for the second half of 1987, including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday, Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.     Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter target.     Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, \"OPEC third quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd\"     Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production levels would have on prices.     Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd, rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Iraq\'s export capacity will be further boosted when a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about September.     Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369 mln in the second half.     Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. \"We will not discuss it. There will not be any change,\" he said.     Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems to be adressed. \"We are overdoing it in holding too short a meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,\" he said.     Ali said the problem of price differentials between the prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly at the meeting.

Light crudes are overpriced relative to heavy crudes.\"     Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said \"If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do the work of another minister.\"     Kuwait\'s own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.

In an article headlined \"Gulf oil sources say Middle East production up 1.4 mln bpd\" and \"Markets witness new surplus amid whispers of return to cheating days,\" it warned OPEC\'s official prices could face fresh pressure from international oil companies seeking cheaper supplies.     It did not say whether only OPEC or Opec and other producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts.    \"The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under fresh scrutiny from Monday, with activity in the European and American markets,\" it said.     The sources were quoted as saying that after Opec had in March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some members had raised output last week. It gave no details.     \"Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and producing over quotas has begun anew,\" it reported.    \"The sources warned that maybe the (price of a) barrel of oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if there is no control on supplies.     \"The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure Opec over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,\" it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift from Qatar unless it gave price discounts.     \"More than one official has warned Opec would find its solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May,\" it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer.   \n',crude
'Military experts say the United States faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a U.S.-flagged tanker.     The experts tolds Tehran holds the initiative and is likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching limited retaliatory strikes.     But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps -- such as mining Iran\'s harbors, blockading its shipping, or destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.     \"Iran is in the driver\'s seat in an absolute sense as the cycle of attack and retaliation continues,\" said Fred Axelgard, a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).     \"It\'s like a Greek tragedy,\" said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll of Washington\'s private Center for Defense Information (CDI) think tank.     Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq.     They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its 30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal  would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which President Reagan could never accept.     U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran\'s Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf time (0700 EDT) on Monday.     Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City on Friday.     Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and allowed to escape.     \"We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures,\" Weinberger said.     \"We consider this matter closed,\" he said.     Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken this view after earlier clashes.  \n',crude
'The current crude oil price of between 18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.     Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government officials said.     They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third World debt and industrialised nations.     Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher energy bills for the world\'s industrial nations, Lukman said.     Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he said.     This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high prices, he added.     Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.  \n',crude
'Flooding in the Red River on the Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a 24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.     \"The water is rushing by so fast that we can\'t get any divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,\" a company source said.     The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.     Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring oil which has been lost to the flood.     \"But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like to proration this pipeline, if we don\'t have to.\"     The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield Corp ARC, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group RD and Texaco Inc TX, which is the pipeline\'s operator.      Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.     July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to 19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.     Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.     Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a barrel below WTI, respectively.     Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.     He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded. The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was apparently washed away.         The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this line.     Texaco\'s Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma, which is nearby.  \n',crude
'The operator of a major U.S. crude oil pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be several days before repairs are made and the system is functioning again.     Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco Inc TX, operator of the pipeline through its subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs will begin in about five days and expects it to take several more days to complete.     \"At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get the job done,\" Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to assess because of flooding on the Red River.     The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.     The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said.     Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with customers to determine their requirements.     Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the  shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices.     Monday, after Texaco confirmed that the pipeline had been closed, West Texas Intermediate crude in the spot market and on New York Mercantile Exchange\'s energy futures complex rose 20 cts a barrel.

'Malaysia\'s national oil company, Petronas, has advised the government to raise crude oil output to 540,000 barrels a day (bpd) in 1988 from a current 500,000 bpd, a senior company official said.     \"We have the capacity to produce the amount,\" Rastam Hadi, Petronas\'s Vice-President for Upstream Sector said.     The government will announce its decision on Friday when it unveils the country\'s budget. Malaysia raised output this month to current levels from 420,000 bpd after reviewing the world oil market.

'U.S. television networks said on Monday that U.S. forces launched a retaliatory strike against Iran late Sunday, apparently attacking two Iranian offshore oil drilling platforms.     NBC News said it understood six Iranians had been pulled from the sea.     It said cautiously that U.S. forces attacked late Sunday and that two Iranian oil platforms east of Bahrain were ablaze as a result, but CBS News and other networks said flatly that U.S. forces attacked the Iranian oil platforms.     U.S. officials had been meeting on a response since Friday when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a U.S.-flagged ship.     President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a decision on the U.S. response to Friday\'s Iran attack but would not say what the decision was.

'Norway\'s September oil output rose by 22.2 pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in August, according to a survey of firms operating here.     Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at several of Norway\'s biggest fields and resumed production at fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field rescue project.     Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway\'s voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.     Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.     Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.     The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August, field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.     Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.     BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.     Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company said.     September production was also sharply higher at the Statfjord field. Norway\'s 84 pct share of Statfjord, which extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.     Norway\'s 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.     Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd in September, compared with 100,188 in August.     Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in August.     Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on stream a second well, cutting September production to just two days.  \n',crude
'Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15 until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle tolds.     \"We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,\" he said. \"The accord reached there means stability in the oil market and we shall continue making our contribution.\"     The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle said. The ministry had written to Norway\'s oil companies and would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.     OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.     OPEC\'s first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and it\'s December pact had provisionally set a third quarter ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth quarter.     Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained within its December accord on output and prices.     Norway\'s oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around 840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.     The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since February reduced Norway\'s oil output by about 80,000 bpd.     Norway\'s Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement on the latest oil production cutbacks.     Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC\'s bid to keep prices stable.     Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around 18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.     Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price during the first half of 1986.     But firmer oil prices since then have brought some stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade deficit.      Norway\'s North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.  \n',crude
'OPEC has shown itself to be in control of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.     They said market respect for the cartel has increased since it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.     \"There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in effect putting pressure on end-users,\" a European crude oil trader said.     In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, \"There\'s no reason to expect a weak market from now on.\"     A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, \"We thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter production so the market will react very bullishly.\"     Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.     August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday\'s 17.15-20 range, but still below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.     Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP\'s. Singapore traders said sellers might now aim for GSP\'s at least.     They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.     They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter requirements before October.     Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.     \"There\'s no doubt consumption will be higher than production by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,\" said an international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less bullish, \"For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on how much they (OPEC members) cheat.\"     A Singapore trade source said, \"There is enough cheating and leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is no need to worry about shortages.\"     Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level, after Iraq\'s rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish factor to be considered.     Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.     Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates quiet on minimal buying interest.     Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and tight prompt supplies, dealers said.  \n',crude
'Some OPEC states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.     They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive.     There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes, to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.     But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in OPEC\'s new unity.     \"All OPEC members can make a good case for changing differentials,\" said one analyst with a major oil company. \"But at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be \"leave well alone\' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.\"     Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases, marketing incentives have helped their sales.     Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a \"package.\"     Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers.     OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.     Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials, analysts say.     The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest. Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.     Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at official prices, with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.     Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year, when some producers\' output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices.    Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude -- now OPEC\'s highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel -- was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain\'s Brent.     In February and March, Nigeria\'s production shrank below its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived, due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has risen.     Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.     But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London\'s Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the differentials question in Vienna.     \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which holds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.  \n',crude
'OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman said he expects next week\'s ministerial meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC\'s current price and production agreement may only need a slight review.     \"I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm,\" Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, told reporters here ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, which starts June 25.     \"We already have an agreement which may need only a slight review,\" Lukman said.     The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers in December last year pegged the group\'s crude oil output at 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement to keep the market stable.     \"I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to strengthen the gains we have made so far,\" Lukman said.     He declined to say if the current ceiling should be maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December.     \"Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our collective will to keep the market strong,\" he said.     He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeks ago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and this was significant for its members.     Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year when OPEC\'s fixed price regime came into effect and a restocking now for the winter was responsible for current market strength.  \n',crude

'Crude oil prices could remain around 18 dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC\'s decision on output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an official of Mexico\'s state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.     Adrian Lajous, Pemex\' executive vice president of international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter. \"Production is surging ahead of what was originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged a few months ago,\" he said.     He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the 18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been envisaged might soften price levels.     The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.     \"I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in terms of volume decisions,\" Lajous said.     A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is always there as a possibility, he said.     \"I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and discipline will be maintained,\" he said.     Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during 1987 if output remains under control.     He said Saudi King Fahd\'s remarks last month, that increased production was not so important as long as incomes would not be affected by the output, were \"very relevant and welcome from such a powerful producer.\"  \n',crude

'The acting governor of Saudi Arabia\'s state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.     They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.     Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher, left in a major oil industry shake up last December.     The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the post permanently.     The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers\' oil market.     The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20 years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.     Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel last December.     Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia does business, the sources said.     The sources had said possible candidates for the governor\'s job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia\'s University of Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi, Ahmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah Islamic Port.  \n',crude
'Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according to the kingdom\'s main producing company, Aramco.     Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167 billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985, while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft from 126.1 trillion, the company\'s annual report said.     Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.      Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the organisation decided to cut production again from last September onwards.     Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.     Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the official Saudi Press Agency.     The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.      Aramco\'s only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44 mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the report said.     The country\'s other five, smaller refineries -- owned by another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced around 750,000 bpd last year.      Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from 998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes per day, the report said.     Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4 billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.   \n',crude
'Saudi Arabia\'s renegotiation of its collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the latter\'s ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry sources said.     Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday\'s edition, said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34 mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and volumes and other terms may be rearranged.     The agreement signed in January for the months from February to June is up for renegotiation.     Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp XON 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc TX 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp MOB and Chevron Corp CHV 550,000 bpd between them.     But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its obligations under the contract     PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective agrement.     John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate schedule although separate agreements with the companies would favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted liftings occur .     \"The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long haul,\" he said.     Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely concentrate on volume rather than price.     Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were being sought, a fact later confirmed bys with Aramco.     Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp CHV, Exxon Corp XON, Mobil Corp MOB and Texaco Inc TX but is now owned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although the ex-partners have various agreements with Saudi Arabia.  \n',crude

'The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backed President Reagan\'s retaliatory strike against Iranian targets in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy in the volatile region.     Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed Monday\'s U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.     The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S. resolve that Iran \"cannot take military action against the United States with impunity.\"     Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.     While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S. retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan comply with the War Powers Act.  \n',crude

'The Soviet oil production target for 1988 has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over this year\'s planned output.     Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday at the Supreme Soviet, the country\'s nominal parliament.     He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation which began in late 1983.     Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil, slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.     January-September figures released at the weekend showed Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467 mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.     Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.     The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988 budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday.  \n',crude
'Kuwait has agreed to charter tankers from the Soviet Union in a move to protect its oil exports through the Mideast Gulf, diplomatic sources said.     They said the agreement followed months of talks with the Soviet Union and the U.S. On ways to secure its oil exports after Iran started to attack Kuwaiti-connected vessels in retaliation for Kuwait\'s backing for Iran\'s war enemy Iraq.     Diplomats said they expect three Soviet tankers initially to reinforce other flags already supporting Kuwait\'s 22-tanker fleet.     The diplomats said they knew of no deal for Moscow to provide a naval escort for its own vessels, but \"the idea of protection is implicit,\" one said.     They said Soviet cargo ships bound for Kuwait in the past to unload arms and materiel for road delivery to Iraq were known to have sailed under escort. So far, none of the Soviet ships are known to have been attacked by Iran. Diplomats said they expected the chartered Soviet tankers to sail between Kuwait and Khor Fakkan on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) coast a short way outside the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf.  \n',crude

They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is now awaiting its approval.     CPC\'s one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31 this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1 at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.     CPC officials also said the company agreed with the Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the government selling price.     Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through C.Itoh.     Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.     Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.     CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to offload CPC\'s needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.     CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln tonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot market compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.  \n',crude

'Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) STAT.OL, operator on Norway\'s North Sea Veslefrikk oil field, has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billion crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a statement.     Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier A/S KVIO.OL won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert Statoil\'s semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.     Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S AMVO.OL, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the well-head platform\'s 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.     Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several months earlier than previously planned.     Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km west of Bergen.     Statoil estimates the field\'s total development cost, including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.     Veslefrikk\'s oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from Norway\'s Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.

'U.S. oil traders said Texaco Inc\'s filing for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code is adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, but opinions are divided on the impact to the market.     \"The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today,\" said one trader. \"Everyone is talking about it, assessing their company\'s situations in relation to Texaco,\" he added.      Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies under the bankruptcy filing.     However, others were less worried. \"The first paid will be the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the shipping industry,\" one New York trader said.     \"If Texaco doesn\'t get crude supplies it can\'t run its refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,\" he added.

'U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a second oil rig in retaliation for Friday\'s Iranian missile attack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.     President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile waterway.     Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by four U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf.     A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the Pentagon said.      Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters that the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.

'The United States\' dependency on foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s, according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates.     Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977.     \"The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable,\" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.     Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990.     \"However, the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction,\" Lichtblau said.     He said that one of the government\'s negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration.     Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.     \"An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if we imposed it alone,\" Lichtblau said.     Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.     A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.     Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy.  \n',crude
'U.S. crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week\'s OPEC meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session.     They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the organization\'s accord in December, have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf.     The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange\'s energy futures and in the spot market. That is its highest level since January 1986.     OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria\'s oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC\'s current price and production agreement may only need a slight review.     Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.     Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC\'s policies, prices should begin easing.     \"OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn\'t already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm,\" said John Hill, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.     OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group\'s production ceiling to 16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln barrels in the fourth quarter.     This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.     Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran, Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output.     \"And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,\" said Nauman Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.     But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.     \"The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are committed to stabilizing the market,\" said Rosario Ilacqua, analyst with L.F. Rothschild.     However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions.     Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a day and Iraq\'s pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000 barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.     Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines, producers receive less money for their oil.     \"The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,\" said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.     \"In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,\" he said.     One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.     \"The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf,\" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites.     Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the U.S. flag, with naval escorts.     \"Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,\" Knuettel said.  \n',crude

'U.S. military planners ruled out Iran\'s Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.     U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and raided another in what the administration called a \"measured and appropriate response\" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.     Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig rather than an onshore economic or military target such as Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at home and in the Gulf.     \"It simply demonstrated the United States will take military action when they (Iran) take military action,\" Norman Polmar, a defense analyst and author, said.     He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.     In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.     Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a Security Council call for a ceasefire.     \"We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there\'s any chance at all,\" he said, adding that the action made it clear tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.     In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran\'s economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the lower Gulf.     \"We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting capabilities,\" Cordesman said.     He predicted the United States would respond to any future major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran\'s naval base at Bandar Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the approaches to Iran\'s oil export terminal on Kharg Island.

'Venezuela will back Ecuador\'s bid to raise its OPEC quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd) because it is a justifiable demand, Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.     He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an earthquake last March.     \"For this five-month period, Ecuador did not exercise its right to produce 221,000 bpd,\" he said. \"We should recognize Ecuador\'s right to increase its quota ... There is a basis of justice in that country\'s petition.\"     He added however, the quota increase should be gradual to avoid harming the market, he added.     Hernandez Grisanti said he understood Ecuador would formally submit the request for a higher quota at the next ministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) opening December 9 in Vienna.  \n',crude
'Venezuela\'s government tomorrow presents a 1988 budget proposal for 183.432 billion bolivars, based upon an oil price of 16.35 dlrs per barrel, finance minister Manuel Azpurua said.     Azpurua told reporters after a cabinet meeting the new budget projects ordinary income of 149.925 billion bolivars and extraordinary income of 34.186 billion. Oil revenues are expected to produce 92.014 billion, or 61 pct of the total.     The finance minister said the oil revenue projection is based on an average price of 16.35 dlrs per barrel in 1988. Venezuelan oil through the first half of 1987 has averaged 16. 20 dlrs per barrel, according to the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A.  \n',crude
'World oil prices would remain stable despite the U.S. Attack against Iranian oil platforms and growing tension in the Gulf, Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.     He described the situation as \"extremely tense,\" but said Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices because supply and demand were roughly equal.     Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group\'s members were now pumping above 18 mln bpd, he told a news conference.     Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction continued.     Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were \"overproducing in an exaggerated manner\" above their assigned quotas, he said.     OPEC\'s overall ceiling is 16.6 mln bpd.  \n',crude
'Oil prices would skyrocket for a time if conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oil supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.     He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military action in the Gulf.     But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian Petroleum Association, he said, \"If worst comes to worst and say the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust, can take care of the situation.\"     \"But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of the situation,\" he declared.     Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively short-term impact on prices, he added.     Assessing future price trends, he said, \"Short-term spot prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per barrel.     \"The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater than the downward ones.\"     \"The balance between supply and demand in the short term will still be delicate,\" he added. \"Non-Opec production may still go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase in world demand.\"     Subroto, a member of Opec\'s three-man quota committee which has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.     In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he said.  \n',crude

'Finland\'s national oil company Neste Oy NEOY.HE said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firms to study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton, Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.     The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.     The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.     The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the important capital and operating advantages gained by locating on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.     The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer that can replace tetra ethyl lead.     Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of health concerns, the statement added.     Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE, it said.     Finland\'s Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.     The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on stream in late 1989, the statement said.  \n',gas
'Japanese oil companies are starting campaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growing domestic demand for higher quality motor fuel, oil sources said.     Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this summer, starting with Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd on June 20.     Showa Shell Sekiyu KK SHOL.T introduced its Formula Shell 98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year.     Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.     \"We have received a good response from consumers of Formula Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel consumption,\" Showa Shell said.     Shell\'s product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share of Japan\'s high octane gasoline market, it said.     High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell\'s total gasoline sales in Japan, it added.     Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately after the launch of its Idemitsu 100.     Nippon Oil Co Ltd NPOL.T said it will launch its 100 octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in high octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline sales.     The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station construction in the next two to three years.     \"Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline production quotas,\" an official at a major oil company said.     An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil companies increase their international competitiveness.     Japan\'s three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil, Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under the production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.     Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 2.5 pct from the previous year, according to a MITI report.  \n',gas

'U.S. analysts expect the American Petroleum Institute\'s weekly report on oil inventories to show a slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended May 29, oil traders and analysts said.     While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that barring any surprises in tonight\'s report, they expect the report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.     Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil prices, the analysts said.     Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports continue at relatively high levels.     Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.     Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who looks for a build said, \"We have had five weeks of gasoline demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw,\" he added.     Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.         The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.     But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3 pct above May 22\'s 81.2 pct capacity operated.     Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add to U.S. stocks.     But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery runs.     Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between 700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was discounted as having a market impact at this time.     \"A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,\" one futures analyst said.     Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build between 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels reported by API for the week of may 22.     The consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added to the nation\'s inventory.  \n',gas
'Kuwait\'s oil-reliant and debt-ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists say.     Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.     Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.     This was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.     Factors depressing economic activity include the 6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait\'s doorstep, which threatens the emirate\'s vital oil export lifeline through the Gulf and has sapped business confidence.     But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced.     The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.     The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending, thus generating an informal credit system.     Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies.     There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs) in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under.     The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not.     Banks\' shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil.     Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.     Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.     But strategic diversification into downstream operations in Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.     Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average 2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as crude.     Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady.     External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit Gulf.     Kuwait\'s petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.     But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these reserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit for the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.     In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary, revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct, doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.     This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some shortfall.     Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next.     \"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer is important.\"     Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy.     He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.  \n',gnp

'Kuwait, a target of Iranian anger over the emirate\'s backing for Iraq in the Gulf war, today rejected charges that fishing vessels seized recently by Iran were spy boats.     \"There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranian accusation on the nature of the operations of the vessels recently taken into custody by Iran.

The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seized seven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who confessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.     It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullah waterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq\'s Faw peninsula at the head of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.

'House Speaker Jim Wright predicted passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and conservatives left the bill\'s fate in doubt.     The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan\'s decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships.

The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising congressional concern over Reagan\'s plan to protect gulf shipping and demands that the allies do more.

Congressional leaders complain they were not consulted about plans to put the U.S. flag on Kuwaiti ships and some charged the policy could lead the U.S. into the Iran-Iraq war.     Conservative Republicans said increasing the U.S. military obligation in the gulf would place impossible burdens on American servicemen and equipment, and warned it could lead to war.     \"It is a real snake pit at best and a powder keg that will blow sky-high at worst,\" said Wisconsin Rep. Toby Roth.      \n',ship
'American lawmakers rallied behind President Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets in the Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress debate over limits on his powers to make war.     The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf ship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.     Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans expressed support for the attack and praised it as an appropriate \"measured response.\"     But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States could erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of American forces from the waterway.     \"Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war with Iran,\" said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon, a Republican.  \n',ship
'U.S. warships attacked and destroyed an Iranian oil platform on Monday in retaliation for Friday\'s Iranian attack damaging a U.S.-flagged ship, U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said.     When asked how much was left of the oil platform, Weinberger said, \"Nothing.\"     \"There was no Iranian reaction,\" he said. \"... We consider this matter is now closed.\"     Weinberger said four U.S. destroyers attacked the platform about 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf with fire at 0700 EDT, Weinberger said.     \"We chose a platform used by the Iranians to interfere with and be a source of potential attack on convoys...,\" Weinberger said at a Pentagon briefing.      \"We know it has been used indeed, to not only launch small boat attacks on shipping but to fire on U.S. helicopters...     \"It\'s removal will contribute significantly to the safety of U.S. forces in the future,\" Weinberger said of the U.S. Navy\'s operation to escort oil tankers through the Gulf.     \"We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by Iran with stronger countermeasures,\" Weinberger said.     He said the 20 to 30 Iranian personnel on the oil platform were given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform.     \"As far as we know they did abandon the site,\" he said.     Weinberger was asked why the United States had chosen to attack an oil platform rather than Iranian Silkworm missile platforms blamed by Washington for Friday\'s attack.  \n',ship
'The United States responded to an apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would play purely a deterrent role.     \"I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that we\'re going to be assuring safety for American shipping and that that shipping is not related to the war itself,\" State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.     He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.     Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday, \"At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of an armed encounter with us.     \"We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S. Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We are determined to stand firm and will certainly win.\"     The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.     The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.     Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, \"We won\'t have any comment or response to the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not helpful or welcome.\"     Redman said he could not independently confirm reports that Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping.  \n',ship
'The leaders of a U.S. Senate team probing American defense strategy in the MidEast Gulf said they favored a multinational force to keep oil flowing through the waterway.     Sen. John Glenn and John Warner, in Kuwait as part of a Gulf Arab tour, said at a news conference that top officials in the area appeared ready to discuss extra facilities needed if the U.S. upgraded its defense role.     The Senate team next heads for the United Arab Emirates, their last stop on a fact-finding mission prompted by Reagan administration plans to let half of Kuwait\'s 22-tanker fleet fly the U.S. flag.     Glenn and Warner said the U.S., Britain and France, should explore the possibility of a unified Gulf force.     \"The American ships, the British ships, the French ships now talk to each other and all we\'ve got to do is formalize this arrangement,\" Warner said.     Glenn said a multinational force could be effectively deployed within 24 hours of a decision.     Glenn voiced a preference for a United Nations multinational force, or failing that, an American, British, French force with cooperation from the Gulf Arab states.     Warner voiced concern that the Soviet Union might use the situation in the Gulf to raise its presence. \"And, unequivocally, all GCC states we have talked with, have said that would not be in the interests of the Arabian peninsula.\"  \n',ship
'U.S. military forces in the Mideast Gulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels and occasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to \"non-belligerent\" states in the area, the Pentagon said today.     \"No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting all shipping in those waters,\" Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims said as the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase the protective U.S. military presence in the gulf.     Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq.     \"As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are under our protection with the exception, on a limited case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the region,\" Sims said.     U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that the the arms would not be used elsewhere.     He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war.     Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack.     Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11 Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additional ships and air cover are under consideration.  \n',ship
'U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright said he would question President Reagan tomorrow about his plan to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers with U.S. warships from attacks by Iran in the Gulf.     House and Senate Democrats, who control Congress, have been critical of Reagan\'s plan but have not decided how or if they should try to pass legislation to prohibit it.     Wright, a Texas Democrat, told reporters the Administration had gone ahead with plans to reflag the Kuwaiti tankers as U.S. ships without asking Congressional leaders for their advice.  \n',ship
'Confronted by new hostilities involving U.S. forces in the Gulf, the U.S. Senate voted to end Republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy.     The measure, however, does not require President Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate bill. The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.     The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.     The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue, including an expression of support or of disapproval for Reagan\'s policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in the waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoy began moving through the Gulf early Tuesday.  \n',ship
'The United States warned Iran again  that it was ready to retaliate for any further hostile military action in the Gulf as U.S. warships began escorting another tanker convoy southward from Kuwait.     U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the U.S. sought no further Gulf hostitilies but was ready to deal with any Iranian response to Monday\'s attack on an Iranian oil rig.     Several hours later, the Pentagon announced that U.S. warships had begun escorting two U.S. flag Kuwaiti tankers -- the 80,000 ton product carrier Ocean City and 46,000 ton liquified petroleum tanker Gas King -- southward from Kuwait.     The Defense Department said the 12th such convoy of U.S. flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the Gulf began at 0230 EDT under the escort by the U.S. guided missile frigate Ford. It did not say what oth U.S. warships were in the area.     \"It (the convoy) is now progressing uneventfully in the central Gulf,\" the Pentagon statement said.     Asked on NBC\'s \"Today\" program if the United States was prepared for a major war with Iran, Weinberger said, \"Well we are prepared I think for whatever eventualities emerge from this situation but we don\'t look on it as a war.\"  \n',ship
