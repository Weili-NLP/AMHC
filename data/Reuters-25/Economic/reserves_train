'Thailand\'s improving economy will likely cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at end-February, private bankers said.     Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.     Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the Bangkok Bank Ltd, said Thailand\'s strong export performance, its relatively high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market, and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan, contributed to the projected sharp rise.     Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.     A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.     Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.     Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold, special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target is equivalent to five-and-a-half months\' worth of imports.  \n',reserves

At the same time its foreign liabilities rose 100 mln to 22.8 billion, producing a rise in net reserves of 200 mln to 82.2 billion on March 31.     The Bundesbank provided banks with liquidity in the fourth March week by disbursing funds in the money market via government-owned banks. Banks took up the Bundesbank\'s standing offer of treasury bills to place excess liquidity.     Banks received more liquidity through routine month-end payments by public authorities as well as expansionary market factors than was lost through the 2.3 billion mark rise in cash in circulation to 122.3 billion, the Bundesbank said.     But banks had to draw heavily on the Lombard emergency financing facility due to month-end tightness, borrowing 5.3 billion marks.     Overall, banks\' holdings at the Bundesbank rose 10.2 billion marks to 58.5 billion at the end of the month, averaging 50.9 billion in the whole of March.     The minimum reserve requirement for March, before deduction of banks\' cash holdings, was set at 61 billion marks.     Public authorities\' net holdings at the Bundesbank fell to 2.2 billion marks in the last March week from 4.4 billion the week before.

Western diplomats in Rangoon estimate the figure at above 70 pct and say the country can no longer depend on foreign exchange reserves to cover more than a few weeks\' imports.

'French official reserves fell 45.06 billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from 421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.     It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the European Monetary System (EMS).     Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs during the month, the ministry said.     This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund, counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).     But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a result of using very short-term financing instruments.     The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the franc.     On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.     The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves to 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74 billion at end December.     Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.     Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billion francs from 75.27 billion at end December.

'Additional capital inflows of 1.5 billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico\'s reserves to about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters.     Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has forced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986.     Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of funds available for badly needed investment.     Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months, Gurria noted.     Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on the commercial banks\' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support contingency facility. That money will be available until April 1988 if Mexico\'s export receipts and the price of oil fall below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said today, \"We expect we\'ll never have to use it.\"     Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World Bank.     Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods.     He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month.     Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results.     Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF for the rest of 1987.     Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris Club.     Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella agreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs of official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks.     In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, he said all countries from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development have continued to provide export credit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.  \n',reserves

Official figures show the latest level compares with the previous record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26 billion in late March 1986.

It bought nearly two billion U.S. Dlrs between March 5 and 23, he said.     Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government\'s Council for Economic Planning and Development, tolds the rising reserves were \"a big headache for Taiwan.\"     He said the government expects heavier pressure from the U.S., Where protectionist bills are being proposed against nations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluses with the U.S.     Wang said the government would launch new measures within the next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open the market wider to foreign products, especially those from the U.S.     Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan\'s trade surplus, which rose to 2.73 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier. Nearly 90 pct of the surplus was with the U.S.     Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien agreed with Wang\'s remarks and said efforts to avert U.S. Protectionism were running out of time. \"We must do it quickly or face retaliation from Washington,\" he said.     He said the measures would include removal of trade barriers on insurance and inland services for U.S. Companies.

He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.     Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise, but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.

'Jordan\'s key economic priorities are having a sound national treasury and adequate foreign exchange reserves, Prime Minister Zeid al-Rifa\'i said.     \"First, the national treasury should be in sound shape when dealing with the public and other countries so that its credibility is preserved,\" he said in a television interview Saturday.     \"The second priority is to maintain an acceptable level of foreign exchange reserves to provide (the) stability and confidence needed by the government to meet foreign commitments.\"     Rifa\'i said Jordan\'s outstanding government-guaranteed and commercial loans total 902 mln dinars with a debt service ratio of 14.9 pct.     The figure was sharply lower than the 1.02 billion dinars in outstanding loans at the end of September, according to latest Central Bank figures.     Rifa\'i dismissed the view of some bankers and economists here that the dinar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies, is overvalued.     \"The dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserve its stability,\" he said.     The prime minister said he hoped the next Arab summit would tackle the question of continuing financial aid to Jordan. Under a 10-year agreement reached in 1978, Jordan was to receive a total of 1.25 billion dlrs annually from Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help it resist Israel.     But only Saudi Arabia met its obligations, while the others failed because of falling income due to lower oil prices.  \n',reserves
'Britain\'s gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 1.785 billion dlrs in March after a 287 mln dlr rise in January, the Treasury said.     This was considerably above market expectations for a 650 mln dlr rise.     The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of borrowings and repayments.     The Treasury declined comment on the figures. Last month it said the Bank of England took the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn.     Actual reserves rose by 1.89 billion dlrs, after rising 305 mln in February, to 22.26 billion. Total reserves were revalued to 27.04 billion dlrs, but would have totalled 24.15 billion under the previous valuation, the Treasury said. Gold reserves were revalued by 895 mln dlrs, while SDRs, ECU and convertible currency holdings were revalued by 1.995 billion.     Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 361 mln dlrs last month, after 36 mln in February. Repayments were 240 mln dlrs after the previous 16 mln. Capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, after February\'s two mln dlrs repayment.  \n',reserves
'Britain\'s gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a 72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.     The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of borrowings and repayments.     This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.     The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.     Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26 billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.     Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a Treasury spokesman said.     Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January, capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund swap.     The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England\'s market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound today.     A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures, said that the government does not want sterling either to rise too far or to fall substantially from current levels.     He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting.     \n',reserves
