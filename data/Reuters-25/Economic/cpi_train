He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise his target for 1987 after the February monthly result of between 0.1 to O.2 pct, following a 0.9 pct rise in January (three pct year on year) that forced the government to revise an earlier target of two pct to a current 2.5 pct.     He said he was happy with \"a good result\" for February but stressed a need for continued \"vigilance\" against inflation.

'A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy.     But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct in 1986, is uncertain.     Forced last month to cut the government\'s 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out.     The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year.     France\'s economic performance, led by a mixed cast of right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed reviews from non-partisan analysts.     For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government\'s outstanding achievement has been to launch \"a veritable intellectual revolution\" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control.     \"The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad -- but set in their context of structural reforms, they are excellent,\" Develle said.     But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief architect of the government\'s free market policies, may be pursuing a mirage.     \"The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological\" said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval. \"Personally I think it\'s an illusion. Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system, from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.\"     Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard. Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks and industries to private investors.     Since December, nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas PARI.PA and glass maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA SGEP.PA, the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five-year privatisation plan.     Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since December.     At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.     The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or less.     \"But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945,\" commented Develle of Paribas.     Other achievements include a major reduction in the state\'s foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1 billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and down from 153.3 billion in 1985.     But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second since Chirac took power.     A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted.     Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology sectors, French industrial goods were \"increasingly ill-adapted to demand\" and over-priced, the report said.     French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed with the report. \"One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,\" he said.     And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment, the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7 million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.     The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.     French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last year\'s oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan, they say. ... \n',cpi
'Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of last week\'s earthquake which killed at least 300 people.

He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of petrol would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct. Petrol supplies would also be limited.     Information Ministry officials said the price freeze was aimed at protecting poor Ecuadoreans from a wave of specualtion.

'France\'s right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year.     Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a 2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.     But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.     And bank economists contacted bys said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988.     \"The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,\" said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. \"We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year.\"     \"The big question is whether the government\'s policy of wage moderation will be maintained,\" he added.     The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity.     But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices.     Calling the government\'s policies \"unbalanced and unjust,\" he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training     Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of France\'s unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority.     But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.     \"Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that,\" commented Michel Develle, economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas.     Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he said.     Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.     \"But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed,\" he commented.     Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living costs.     But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.     Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long as the government kept wages under control.     Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute, INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better, he added.     Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit, several analysts said.     So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth, they said.      \n',cpi

The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986 cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.     The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the first part of 1987.

He said one potential channel for renewed inflationary pressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in the exchange markets, which would push import prices up sharply.     He said participants in financial markets and business remain skeptical of prospects for lasting price stability.     \"Should the skepticism about our ability to resist inflation be reinforced by bad policy, the consequences for interest rates, for exchange rates, and for the economy generally would clearly be undesirable...recognition of that danger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation of monetary policy,\" the Fed chairman said.

'Swiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987 and 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domestic economy, the Centre for Economic Research of the Federal Institute of Technology said in its spring review.     It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988 compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helped to keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct.     The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss economy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the more difficult international economic climate facing export industry.     The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in Swiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5 pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7 pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review.     Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the motor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986.     Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from 2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent years. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct.     The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has firmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure on Swiss exporters.     It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more modest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct.     Industrial production will grow by 1.6 pct in 1987 and 1.2 pct in 1988 compared with 4.2 pct in 1986.  \n',cpi
'Swiss consumer prices rose one pct in the year to March, the same rise as in the year to February, and against 0.9 pct in the year to March 1986, the Federal Statistics Office said.     In March alone, prices rose 0.1 pct after a 0.3 pct rise in February.     The March index, base 1982, was 109.7 against 109.5 in February.     The Statistics Office said the March increase reflected rises in certain sectors such as food, clothing and household goods and falls in transport, heating and lighting.     Both home produced and imported goods rose by 0.1 pct during the month. But over the year as a whole, domestically generated inflation reached 2.5 pct, offset by a 2.8 pct drop in imports.  \n',cpi
'Switzerland\'s economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said.     This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said.     The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.     The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year\'s sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.     But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area.     Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986.     The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years.     But \"given Switzerland\'s large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances,\" the OECD said.     Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted.     In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall GDP, it added.     The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said.     As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986.     But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange.     The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.     Particularly for the banks, \"recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position,\" it said.  \n',cpi
'Inflation in Turkey was 3.7 pct in March compared with 1.7 pct in February and 1.3 pct in March 1986, the State Statistics Institute said.     The annual rate rose to 34.7 pct in March compared with 31.7 pct in February and 34.2 pct in March 1986. The government\'s target is to reduce inflation this year to an annual 20 pct.     The consumer price index, base 1978/79, was 1,957.3 compared with 1,886.8 in February and 1,452.7 in March, 1986.  \n',cpi
'The Retail Price Index (RPI), Britain\'s measure of inflation, rose 0.4 pct in February on a revised basis, to give a year-on-year rise of 3.9 pct, the Employment Department said.     In January, the index rose 0.4 pct for a 3.9 pct year-on-year rise on both the previous base and the new index.     The February RPI was set at 100.4, base January 1987. In February 1986, the RPI rose 0.4 pct, giving a 5.1 pct year-on-year increase on the old basis.     The inflation data compares with market forecasts for a rise of 0.4 - 0.5 pct in February and a yearly rise of about four pct, economists said.     The Employment Department said the rise in the index between January and February was mainly the result of higher prices for petrol, fresh vegetables, cars and car maintenance.  \n',cpi
'The U.K. Government tomorrow will release the first of its Retail Price Index (RPI) figures calculated on a revised group of components and rebased on January 1987, as previously announced, the Employment Department said.     The index, Britain\'s measure of inflation, is for February. Earlier data will not be revised as there are no equivalent figures including the new components, a spokesman said.     Previously, the RPI base was January, 1974.     Market forecasts centre on a 0.4-0.5 pct monthly rise in February and a year on year rate about 4.0 pct. The government forecasts annual inflation will be 4.0 pct at the end of 1987.  \n',cpi
'U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI-U), rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain, the Labor Department said.     The CPI for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) rose to 329.0 in February, the department said.     Prices for petroleum-based energy rose sharply for a second consecutive month during February but by less than in January, the department said.     Energy prices rose 1.9 pct last month after a 3.0 pct rise in January, accounting for one-third of the overall CPI rise.     For the 12 months ended in February, the CPI rose an unadjusted 2.1 pct.     Transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct increase in January. Smaller price rises for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges were responsible for the moderation.     Gasoline prices rose 4.2 pct last month after increasing 6.6 pct in January, but were still 18 pct below levels of a year ago, the department said.     Housing prices rose 0.4 pct in February after a 0.5 pct January increase, largely due to a rise in fuel oil prices.     Fuel oil prices were up 4.4 pct in February after increasing 9.8 pct in January, but were still 15 pct below price levels of February 1986.     Food prices rose 0.2 pct last month after a 0.5 pct January increase. Grocery store food prices were up 0.4 pct, the same as in January, but meat, poultry, fish and eggs cost less for a third consecutive month, the department said.     Medical care rose 0.3 pct in February to a level 7.1 pct above one year ago, because of higher costs for prescription and non-prescription drugs and medical supplies, the department said.     The index for apparel and upkeep rose 0.7 pct in February after a 0.4 pct increase in January. The department said the introduction of higher priced spring merchandise, particularly men\'s clothing, was responsible for the advance.     Prices for other goods and services rose 0.7 pct in February following a 1.1 pct increase in January. Tobacco prices, up 0.9 pct after a 2.0 pct January increase, accounted for 30 pct of the index rise, the department said.  \n',cpi
'Consumer energy costs rose 1.9 pct in February following a sharp rise last month, the Labor Department said.     The February increase in the overall energy costs, including petroleum, coal and natural gas, followed a 0.2 pct drop in December and a 3.0 pct rise in January, it said.     Energy prices were 12.2 pct below year-ago levels.     The department\'s Consumer Price Index showed that the cost of gasoline rose in February by 4.2 pct, after a 6.6 pct rise in January.     Gasoline prices were nonetheless 18.0 pct below their levels as of February 1986.     Also, the category including fuel oil, coal and bottled gas rose in February by 3.8 pct, putting it 14.9 pct under the year-ago figure.     The index also showed that natural gas and electricity were unchanged last month, but down 3.5 pct from the February 1986 figure, the department said.     The index has been updated  o reflect 1982-84 consumption patterns; previously, the index was based on 1972-73 patterns.  \n',cpi
'Latest consumer price data indicate U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be above last year\'s pace, economists said.     \"Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time last year, but it\'s not building up a large head of steam,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.     U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price index for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices, which fired January\'s data with a three pct rise, advanced a more moderate 1.9 pct last month.     The CPI came within the range of economists\' expectations and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.     Among the key components of the report, transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges.     \"There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.     Economists said the latest CPI supports existing expectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.     The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986. Without last year\'s energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.     Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a result of the dollar\'s drop as well as the volatile energy component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become factored into the wider economic picture.     \"As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct inflation,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.  \n',cpi
