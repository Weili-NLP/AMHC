'The government must announce harsh cuts in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give an adequate response to Australia\'s economic problems, the ANZ Banking Group Ltd ANZA.S said.     Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14 billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthly Business Indicators publication.     \"For the past two years, the government has struggled with an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it sees as politically practicable,\" it said.     The political climate meant there would be a continued over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and maintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.     \"The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival of business investment will be further postponed,\" it said.     The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by export and import-replacement industries which had created a false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of payments crisis were past. \"Unfortunately, successful adjustment to Australia\'s deep-seated economic problems remains a long-term process,\" it said.     In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderate overall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP) rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.     The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP this year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion at end-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.     Inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988 from 8.9 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were expected, ANZ said.  \n',bop

'South Korea has decided on major changes in its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducing the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a trade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.     Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports could make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase &#127;nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which means abandoning Seoul\'s goal of rapidly reducing its foreign debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.     Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation and rationalising exports.     He said Seoul would try to limit its current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few years, although trade volume would continue to grow.     \"This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP (gross national product) from the current five pct level to three pct by 1991,\" he added.     Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea\'s foreign debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5 billion dlrs at end-1986.     \"But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,\" he said.     The policy change was announced two days before the scheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.     South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.     Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing in South Korea\'s current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose 36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.     The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5 billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw materials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.     \"The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at 1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are considerable incentives given to increase imports,\" Koo said.     Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency. \"It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean currency continues to rise in value,\" he said.     He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the dollar gradually, but added \"We do not believe in rapid one-shot changes in the value of the won.\"     The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen six pct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986.  \n',bop
'Spain had a 35 mln dlr current account surplus in February compared with a 68 mln dlr surplus in January and a 355 mln dlr surplus in February last year, Bank of Spain figures show.     Spain\'s trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159 mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986.     Exports at 2.58 billion dlrs were up 19 pct compared with February last year, but imports were 46 pct higher than last February, totalling 3.16 billion dlrs.     Non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with 1.91 billion in February last year, reflecting the large ammount of investment goods entering the country with the recovery of the Spanish economy, the Bank of Spain said.

'Consumer prices in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rose 0.3 pct in February and inflation rose to 2.4 pct year-on-year, the OECD said in a communique.     The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working their way out of the index. The February increase was less than Janauary\'s 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for the later months of 1986.

'The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government implements an employers\' association recommendation for a 10 pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.     The government\'s own proposal for an across-the-board daily pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.     The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).     The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4 pct if the government\'s recommendation is implemented, Solita said. Both were proposed last month.     Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct by the National Economic and Development Authority early this month.

'South Africa is expected to unveil tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year in a bid to boost the nation\'s flagging economic growth rate, economic analysts said.     Faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is expected to raise significantly the government\'s overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament, the analysts said.     Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.     \"Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,\" said Rob Lee, chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.     South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct.     Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5 pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over 30 pct.     Economists estimate that the government\'s spending target will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of GDP.     The government, having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget, analysts said.     \"The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,\" said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.     Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets.     South African Mutual\'s Lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49 billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5 pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the IMF.     \"The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,\" predicted one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past two years.     The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in September 1985.     Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation, government officials say economic growth is the prime objective.     But private-sector economists caution that the government\'s ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the current account of the country\'s balance of payments.     Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5 billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the nation\'s estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks.     Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has little room to manoeuvre.     Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and South African Transport Services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.     Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.     \"This will not be a very exciting budget,\" commented Harry Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive Federal Party. \"I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the sweets were given out before the election.\"  \n',cpi
'The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese energy demand, ministry officials said.     MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600 mln, they said.     The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen and a decline in domestic electric power demand.     MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.     They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.     Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan\'s electric power in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27 pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.  \n',crude
'The official Soviet news agency Tass denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would bring no dividends to the Reagan administration.

Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought broader contacts with Iran in the last year.

'Australia\'s economy should manage modest growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but unemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     The organisation\'s latest half-yearly report says Gross Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.     The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.     The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.     While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year, however, the report revises downwards the OECD\'s earlier growth forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.     The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is struggling to recover from a major economic crisis.     The country\'s GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year, should again show growth over the next two years, rising by 0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.  \n',gnp
'West German Economics Minister Martin Bangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country\'s leading economic research institutes for early introduction of a major tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.

Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987, with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.     Bangemann said \"The government, agreeing with the majority, sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for exports expressed by the minority.\"     He said there was reason to believe that export demand would start to rise in the course of the year, partly because of a further increase in world trade.  \n',gnp
'A trade-led boom in the U.S. is unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its latest economic report.     Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year, after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.     As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5 pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke, the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.     \"Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause a falloff in the growth of disposable income,\" Van Dyke said.     Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8 pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.     The report was released before the Commerce Department reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May, after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with a 0.6 pct increase the month before.     The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9 pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.     This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income  growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.     As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.     The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in 1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.     \"For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988 or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,\" Van Dyke said.     Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an improvement in trade. \"However, with protectionist attitudes on the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,\" he added.  \n',gnp
'The Philippines\' first quarter growth figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose Fernandez said in an interview.     The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter from a year earlier.     \"I don\'t see anything on the horizon that should cut it (growth) short,\" Fernandez said.      NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year\'s GNP growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.     \"Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block,\" Fernandez said.     \"I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power, showed that the economy was on a different track from last year,\" he said.     Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it could drop off in the third quarter.     He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in 1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.     \"That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,\" he said.     He said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.     The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling 58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988. Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or August to review performance in the January-June period.     He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs. Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.     \"It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA (official development assistance) accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line,\" he said.     It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.     The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28 billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.     Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984 to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in October last year, had almost been completed.     He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well. \"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,\" he said.     Commenting on the country\'s foreign debt Fernandez said, \"I think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable.\"     The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach 29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.     NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.     Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.     Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country\'s exports more competitive.     \"By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country\'s trading partners,\" he said.     On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the Code.     The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has been delayed by objections from some business groups.     \"I think any central bank, certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and I\'m not about to do that,\" Fernandez said.     \"It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free,\" he said.     \"We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external availabilities simply by servicing our debts.\"  \n',gnp
'Economic growth will remain sluggish in the Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may rise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast.     Belgium\'s GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.     While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming its borrowing requirement, \"it will probably be insufficient to check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,\" the OECD said.     In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5 pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming less competitive and imports rising. \"Employment is forecast to decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the private sector and budgetary cuts,\" the report said.     Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987 and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining domestic gas prices.     Luxembourg\'s economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in wages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year. \n',gnp
'Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax reform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.     \"Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,\" Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.     Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he forecast in the February budget.     And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32 billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.     Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated revenues.     But finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system.     The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1 billion dlrs in 1991.     Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an actual 3.1 pct.     Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around the current four pct level over the next two years.  \n',gnp
'The West German government\'s independent council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said.     A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two pct was achievable.     It added the council believed \"an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for.\"     Ost\'s statement said experts believed further pressure on West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase.     The government regularly uses the term \"changed external economic factors\" when referring to the fall of the dollar, which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but could still fall below the 1986 level.     Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.     The stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the West German government ahead of next week\'s seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.     West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.     The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.     The experts\' prediction for economic growth this year of between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.     Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987 predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct, compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.  \n',gnp
'Figures for first quarter 1987 West German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal Statistics Office said.     The official said there had been a delay in gathering information for the data, which are expected to show that the West German economy contracted in the period.     A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.     \"There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical matter,\" he added.     The West German government is expected to come under pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.     However, government officials have ruled out any further tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.     Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the widest measure of a country\'s economic activity, fell in real terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.      The government has confirmed that growth was negative in the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to be about two pct.     Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank\'s reluctance to cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate, at three pct, is just above historical lows.     West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad, is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over two years.     The government has pointed out that depressed exports are the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will compensate for this setback.     It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.  \n',gnp
'The global economy is expected to weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook, economic analysts said.     For finance ministers and central bankers attending this week\'s semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern.     The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.     In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.     For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product, another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year.     The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt.     IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.     Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.     Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations\'  economies poses fundamental worries.     Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange, including the key one of exports.     The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion, has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only 2.3 pct, according to the IMF.     For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success.     The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade deficit.     Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much slower than expected.     The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect.\"     The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion.\"^M \n',gnp
'France\'s growth rate is expected to strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly higher than in the first half of this year.     The OECD said France\'s economic situation has deteriorated somewhat during the early months of 1987.      Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.     The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.     The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct for the whole year, sharply up from last year\'s 2.2 pct.  \n',gnp
'Malaysia\'s recovery from the worst recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988 after seven years of austerity, economists said.     \"Our country is walking on one leg now,\" said Ismail Salleh, an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International Studies. \"It has to depend on public sector investment for faster growth if the private sector is not moving.\"     Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.     The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply. Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.     The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.     Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.     Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.     One businessman said too many politicians give the impression that Malaysia was unstable.     \"If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential to recover strongly is great,\" a banker said.     Malaysia\'s 1987 current account is expected to be in the black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit surplus compared with last year\'s 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.     The government has said its fiscal policies will balance the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.     The government will also repay some of its external debt, which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.     Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential goods are unlikely to change.     Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to compete for investors with neighbouring states.  \n',gnp
'The five leading West German economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.     The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen predicted in the institutes\' joint spring report that gross national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast three pct 1987 growth in October last year.     Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin and Munich\'s Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.     The joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the DIW and Ifo were \"markedly less favourable\" than those of the other three.     The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year. \"In the second half of 1987 there will, however, only be a weak upward movement,\" they said.     The two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year.     The other three institutes, however, wrote: \"The decline in demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.\"     They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans. But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off. \"It can be presumed that the braking actions (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.\"     They added: \"The domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable.\"     These three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring.     However, this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar.     Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in 1987, \"there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year.\" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.     The three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986, while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.     They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in 1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.     All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23 mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about 200,000.     These three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures. The construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980 but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.     The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector, while \"the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline.\"     The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to 2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.     They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58 billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around 100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.     The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.  \n',gnp
'The five leading West German economic research institutes, which have revised down their forecasts for 1987 growth, do not predict a recession in West Germany, their spokesman, Hans-Juergen Schmahl said.     The institutes were divided in their spring report on forecasts for 1987, with three predicting two pct growth and two seeing only one pct expansion. Growth was 2.4 pct in 1986.     Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said, \"None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the beginning of a recession.\" He added, however, that exports remained the weak point of the economy .     Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect further encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets.     Arthur Krumper of Munich\'s Ifo institute, which with the DIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of the economy, said, \"The braking effects (on the economy) produced by external factors will remain considerable for most of the year.\"  \n',gnp
'Italy\'s economic outlook for 1987 and 1988 is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly lower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade deficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last year Italy ranked as one of the OECD\'s fastest growing economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.     The OECD said Italy\'s GDP may grow by three pct in 1987, but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.     The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report said.     This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.     Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in Italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.  \n',gnp
'Italy\'s Gross Domestic Product, calculated at 1980 prices, rose 2.4 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, compared with the same period in 1985, National Statistics Institute ISTAT said.     ISTAT said in a statement that GDP growth in fourth quarter 1986 was zero compared with the preceding quarter. Italy\'s budget ministry said last month that 1986 GDP rose 2.7 pct in real terms from 1985.     Imports in the fourth quarter totalled 26,361 billion lire, down 1.4 pct from the 1985 fourth quarter and down 6.6 pct from the third 1986 quarter, ISTAT said.     Istat said exports totaled 23,190 billion lire in the fourth quarter, down 4.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter and down 6.7 pct from the third quarter in 1986.     Fixed investments were 23,438 billion lire in the fourth quarter, down 0.7 pct from the preceding quarter and up 1.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter.  \n',gnp
'Prospects for world economic growth remain very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize currencies and encourage investment, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.     \"The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months, and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments imbalances are likely to persist,\" it said in one of its gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.     The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only 2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year\'s 2.5 pct growth rate.     \"We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area comfortably exceeding three pct,\" David Henderson, head of the OECD\'s economics and statistics department, said.     The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S., Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic downturn.     \"At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth remain favorable,\" it said, citing low inflation in most major countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible labor markets.     But private sector confidence had been undermined by uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that \"for confidence to be restored, it is important for governments swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.\"     This was a clear reference to last February\'s Louvre accord of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.     The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.     Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this process, though it was too early to estimate its precise impact.     He said the measures will help strengthen Japan\'s domestic demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.     The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct increase in 1986.     There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last year.     The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from price guarantees and other measures linked to production towards direct income support for farmers.  \n',gnp
'High wage settlements in Nordic countries threaten to cut exports and reduce the international competitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration in competitiveness. Sweden\'s competitive position was also seen at risk from accelerating wages.     The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as Norway, Sweden and Finland.     Overall economic growth will vary in the different countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report said.     After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark and Norway.     Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained and balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.  \n',gnp
'West German economic growth will slow to 1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic demand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its semi-annual review of the world economy.     This view is less favourable than the West German government\'s forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.     The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year, with the gross national product rising by two pct in real terms.     The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some recovery in business confidence in the near future.     But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by 2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986\'s 3.7 pct.     While noting that the government is bringing forward a five billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that \"the medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow relatively lower tax rates.\"     Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of 1986.     Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.     West Germany\'s current account surplus, the target of considerable criticism by the Reagan administration, is expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from 35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in 1988.  \n',gnp
'The United States should take urgent action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on growth of the defense budget, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy, said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit \"could seriously affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere.\"     It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987, running until September 30 this year, would substantially overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act\'s target of 144 billion dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.     \"The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190 billion dollars,\" it said.     While this would be 30 billion lower than last year\'s deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.     The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to 2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.     In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.     Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.     \"Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors behind the avoidance of recession,\" the report said.     The current account balance of payments deficit is expected to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.     In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year, unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct this year.     Canada\'s current account deficit is projected to shrink to around four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about that level in 1988.  \n',gnp
'Pakistan says its economy has continued its recent outstanding performance during the financial year 1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments, investments and energy were causing concern.     GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980 and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according to a government economic survey.      The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum and there was an impressive performance in a five point government program for rural uplift, education and poverty alleviation, said the survey.     Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.     The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.     Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from 2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.     More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in home remittances, he said.     The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to 2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of the boost in exports.     He said national investment continued to be small because of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the present growth rate and to finance the country\'s seventh five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.  \n',gnp
'Portugal\'s economy, which has been enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade, may now be strong enough to shrug off the country\'s latest government crisis, analysts said.     But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva\'s government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.     Cavaco Silva\'s minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.     The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office.     In 1986, Portugal\'s economy grew four pct, its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.     Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken.     \"The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation,\" said Fritz Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.     \"The market doesn\'t see this as a real crisis yet,\" economist Jorge Braga de Macedo tolds.     Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress.     The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution.     Portugal\'s developing stock markets, however, remain buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.     Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell, predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year.     But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development.     Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month, can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament.     Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution. \"There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections,\" Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said.     He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year.     The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority.     A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.     Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms.     The left-wingers said Portugal\'s positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD policies.  \n',gnp
'South Africa recorded annualised real growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this year and the economy should achieve the government\'s target of three pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.     The South African central bank said in its quarterly bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the nation\'s gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement in the rand\'s exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.     It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the third and fourth quarters of last year.     It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement reached with international creditors in March as evidence of improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.     The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa\'s short term foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.     South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of 7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus of 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninth consecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985.  \n',gnp
'South Korea\'s gross national product (GNP) will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise further as long as the current account surplus continues to widen, Deputy Prime Minister Chun In-Yong told reporters.     Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said his GNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will remain stable.     The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct.     GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and 1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures.     GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.     In the first four months of this year, the current account swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period.     \"What the Minister said does not imply any major economic policy change,\" a Ministry spokesman tolds. \"But he tried to urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic (future) ... A high won era.\"     South Korean manufacturers, who have insisted the won should not rise more than seven pct this year, have said they plan to ask the government to slow down its appreciation against the dollar.     The Bank of Korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05 against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986.     The won strengthened by 6.60 won to the dollar in three days earlier this month while an International Monetary Fund team held talks here to discuss revaluation.  \n',gnp
'Strong growth in domestic demand was a key feature of the economies of southern European countries in 1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal\'s total domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption.     Turkey\'s economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year.     In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment, had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong.     The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European Community and declining competitiveness.     In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather.  \n',gnp
'The economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.     Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.     \"These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?\" said Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.     The Commerce Department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.     Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending rose a weak 0.1 per cent.     \"Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing -- are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, \" Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics, tolds.     Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages.     To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise, returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption, he says.     \"I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,\" Gramley said.     Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia.     Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, \"The pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy\" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be accommodative.     Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession.     Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an inventory overhang still exists.     He says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.     \"They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a recession,\" Mauro said.     In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve.     \"Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable,\" he said.     But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation.     Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.     The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.     \"The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle, it continues to persist,\" he said, adding he would like the Fed to tighten credit.     A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says a prominent international banker.     Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National Press Club that the dollar\'s downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the United States is the world\'s largest debtor nation.     The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever. \"It is very difficult to be optimistic,\" Gut said.  \n',gnp
'The five leading West German economic research institutes said the government should do more to stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of tax cuts planned for 1990.     In their joint spring report the institutes were divided about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national product grew 2.4 pct last year.     But the report said all the institutes believed that \"more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created.\"     The institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. \"From this point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be brought forward.\"     The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.     However, the institutes criticised the government, not only for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of its financing had been left open.     The government has not specified how the remaining 19 billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for, though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.     The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government.     They also said the government should reduce tax preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value-added tax.     The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.     They referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this as an increase in subsidies.     The institutes said total subsidies, including tax preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it should be possible \"despite ... Major political difficulties\" to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.     The institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.     The report also noted that the government was progressing only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim for more competition, it said.  \n',gnp

'The Agriculture Ministry declined comment on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.     \"We have no idea about the report and cannot comment,\" a spokesman tolds.     Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources, said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for farm talks.     The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.     Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff Control Act.     Nihon Keizai said Japan\'s plan resulted from worries about mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is justified, it said.     The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade round last September. It will take four years to negotiate.  \n',grain
'The Pakistani government allowed the private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy announced to cover the next three years.     Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn.     Cotton and rice are Pakistan\'s main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and rice along with the state corporations.     He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and to enable them to compete effectively in the world market. This would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.  \n',grain

The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow so-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather than late this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not be changed.

'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.     Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry\'s Economic Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help Japan as well as the United States.     The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.     However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was already the world\'s largest grain importer.     Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food requirements in 1985.     Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on beef, citrus products and rice.     Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice because potential production is higher than domestic demand.     The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of rising production by exporting countries, he added.     Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product output with expensive programs, Maki said.     Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter will join.  \n',grain
'White House Budget chief James Miller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might \"overreact\" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession next year.     \"Our greatest danger is overreaction,\" Miller told newspaper reporters yesterday. \"I\'m concerned about the Fed\'s overreaction. I\'m concerned about what I see in recent data showing a substantial fall in the money supply.\"     Edwin Dale, Miller\'s spokesman, said the remarks, published in the New York Times today, were accurate.     Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he said could have \"political consequences.\"     The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential and congressional elections next year.     \"My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep soup, and there is no question about it,\" he said.     Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax revenues and a widening of the budget deficit.     Miller\'s remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of bolstering the dollar.     Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize global growth prospects.     U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist pressures in the United States.  \n',interest
'Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.     With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark, Schlesinger tolds that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed.     The economy is picking up, after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth, he added. \"We may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter,\" he said in an interview.     Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.     Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in 1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.     He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct.    \"It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly,\" he said, noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.     Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank\'s three to six pct target.     He said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.     \"There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed,\" Schlesinger said.     A major reason for the inflows was the market\'s conviction that the mark was headed higher. \"As we can see from the market, expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished,\" Schlesinger said.     The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.     Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87 marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.     At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.     \"Central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,\" Schelsinger said.     \"One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,\" he said, adding, \"It is not only our own case, it is also the American case.\"     He said that the West German export industry has been hit hard by the dollar\'s sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now. \"But it wouldn\'t be good to have short-term fluctuations,\" he said. \"Let us wait and see.\"     \"It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level (of rates) as such,\" Schlesinger said.     The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West German inflation down year.     Although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.     Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term, in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.     The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16 months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank\'s council, Schlesigner said.     But he added: \"I don\'t see any great pressure to go away from it.\"  \n',interest
'The head of Spain\'s employers\' federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried about the government\'s monetary policies because high real interest rates were hampering investment.     He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this year were not endangering the government\'s five pct inflation target. The government\'s perceived need to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.     High real interest rates were attracting an influx of speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the government\'s target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.     Spain\'s most closely-watched measure of money supply, liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17 pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.     To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from 11.8 at end-1986.     Cuevas said employers were heeding the government\'s call to hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year, with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.     These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.     He said Spain\'s current wave of strikes mainly affected the state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five pct wage ceiling.     Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in Spain\'s foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct increase over the corresponding period last year.     However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the peseta to correct the imbalance.  \n',interest
'Today\'s U.K. Economic data have pushed the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.     A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing production data showed that the economy is still strong and does not need a fillip from lower rates.     News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually, taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist arguments against easier credit, they said.     \"The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near term,\" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.     Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday\'s mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K. Rates.     It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such optimistic economic news as May\'s record reserves rise which mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling\'s strength.     The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm about May\'s 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying average earnings in April, dealers said.     The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset the impact on domestic money supply of its current intervention.     \"The gilt market reaction was correct,\" said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.     \"That\'s very important ... It shows the economy in a very good state indeed,\" Skeoch said.     \"There\'s no reason to get worries about inflationary pressures because they\'re very subdued.\" Unit wage cost rises were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings which were potentially inflationary, he added.     \"I don\'t think these average earnings numbers are a major problem,\" agreed Chase Manhattan\'s Marshall.     But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried about the funding implications of recent intervention.     He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that the ruling Conservatives would win last week\'s election, now looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.     However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still trigger a base rate cut and that today\'s figures did not signal higher inflation this year.     \"Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As long as that continues we\'re okay,\" he added.  \n',interest
'The Federal Reserve will promote lower interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth, First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.     As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without subverting national U.S. economic policy.     \"On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and, because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its part by moving rates down,\" Wojnilower said in a report.     \"Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants have seen little to fear,\" Wojnilower said.     He said last week\'s \"hiccup\" in money and currency rates and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.     Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.  \n',interest

'An income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.     Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies.     The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech. He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could be much higher than the government\'s 1.3 billion dlr forecast.     Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.     He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986, but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact. Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation.     The government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.     New Zealand\'s inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.     The major deficiency in the government\'s anti-inflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.     \"The widespread belief that (New Zealand\'s) problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based -- primarily because the government\'s macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,\" Bayliss said.  \n',money-fx
'Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support the dollar, other than foreign exchange intervention.     He also told reporters that many major nations yesterday intervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen.     Yesterday\'s intervention was large in terms of the countries involved and the amounts expended, he said.     With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen, 0speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japan might take new measures to support the U.S. Currency, such as curbing capital outflows.     Miyazawa said that yesterday\'s news of a 4.3 pct rise in U.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected. Although the growth looks robust on the surface, the figures in reality are not that good, he said.     He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expected to come up with a final set of recommendations of ways to stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week.     Commenting on yesterday\'s report on economic restructuring by a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone, Miyazawa said it was important to put the panel\'s recommendations into effect.  \n',money-fx
'Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an advisory panel to the government\'s Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said.     The advisory body said in its report that the yen would soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global basis were delayed.     An EPA official tolds the dollar could fall to slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to restructure their economies.     The dollar\'s fall without structural adjustments would cut Japan\'s current account surplus to two pct of gross national product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually during the seven-year period to 1993.     If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan\'s current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This scenario put Japan\'s GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.     It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.  \n',money-fx
'The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.     Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth.?#5;&#30;side measures to boost growth, he said.      \"I think it is possible that there may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in Germany,\" he added, but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.     Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on \"a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.\"     He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced \"satisfactory exchange rate stability,\" in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and he was \"content\" with sterling\'s exchange rate.     Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May currency reserves announced today he said, \"we have been playing a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.\"     Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic commitments underlying the accord.     \"Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in Paris ... In this respect.\" He said the U.S. Budget deficit was \"very important.\"     Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson said, \"what is really needed in Japan is an increase in merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.\"     \"There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified,\" he said.     Lawson doubted that Tokyo\'s partners would indulge in \"Japan bashing\" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of Nakasone\'s plans to increase Japanese development aid over the next three years.     Japan\'s more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.     He said he thought West Germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth.     In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of German national industries.     On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to make progress in Venice.     The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.     Lawson said he would seek \"to consolidate political backing for the plan at the Venice summit\" and hoped the programme would be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.     He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt provisions.     \"First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,\" he said.     U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations, strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions. \"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,\" Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions.     He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit. \"There is a consensus, which we have to push further.\"  \n',money-fx
'Analysts said they were surprised at the government\'s announcement of a forecast budget surplus for fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy statements and positive for the economy.     Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.     Analysts polled bys said the forecast budget surplus was even more positive than the most bullish analysts\' forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.     Market expectations among analysts questioned bys before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a 2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.     The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically, the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.     However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will move lower.     The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget release.     Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share market, despite an increase in the contribution of company taxation to revenue figures.     One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus announcement could push the share market up by 50 points tomorrow.     The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a continuation of existing policies, and the absence of traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively by overseas investors, another said.     But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share market, particularly multi-national companies.     The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements, through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.     Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely credible.     \"Altogether it looks good for Labour\'s election prospects,\" he said.     An election is due before the end of September.  \n',money-fx

'Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth.     In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here, Poehl said \"It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit.\"     He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route.     Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth.     He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament.     But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.     Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home.     \"A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth,\" he said.     Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.     But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy.     The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.     \"For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful,\" he said.     He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan\'s trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States.     Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated.     All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said.     \"This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues,\" he said.     But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar\'s value could overshoot.  \n',money-fx

'New U.S. Banking data suggest the Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists said.     But they also said that if money supply growth remains weak, as this week\'s unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary policy.     A survey of 17 money market economists produced a forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June 8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.     Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for the week ended June 1, this means the nation\'s money supply has fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks, economists said.     \"M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,\" said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.     While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen as better gauges of economic growth.     Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed\'s 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.     If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials, concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging, could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.     \"Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open market position? No,\" Sullivan said. \"But does this mean the end of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.\"     Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.     But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day net miss in the Fed\'s reserve projections, the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached.     A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging, while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.     \"If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed easing at some point,\" he said.     Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth. \"It has been a number of years since M-1 has given good signs of what\'s going on in the economy,\" one said. \"I don\'t think M-1 shows that the economy is falling apart and the Fed should ease.\"     Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary policy.     They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke off econmomic growth.     But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late April. \"The Fed has to determine if this represents a fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives them more room to ease,\" he said.  \n',money-supply
'Robert Heller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said he expects \"more modest levels\" of growth in the money supply this year.     \"In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a most desireable development,\" he said in a speech prepared for delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange, Calif.

Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.     \"The pricing behavior of American producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future,\" he said.     Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would \"generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector\" and might not gain more market share for U.S. producers.     \"A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be the result of such a behavior pattern,\" Heller warned.     He said \"we at the Federal Reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy.\"      Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes.     \"The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets,\" Heller said.     He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.     A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with Canada \"would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American producers to compete more effectively in that country,\" Heller said.  \n',money-supply
'Four of West Germany\'s five leading economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.     But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin, echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not necessarily threaten stability.     The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.     The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.     Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may seem exaggerated, they said.     \"But it has often turned out in the past that the price climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into a restrictive policy,\" they said.     The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.     The four institutes disputed the view that monetary expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market investments following lower interest rates.     \"Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a smaller expansion of money supply,\" they said.     A return to growth and stability did not require spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.     The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic weakness other factors should be taken into account.     Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat in itself to price stability.     The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the falling mark.  \n',money-supply

'The U.S. is drafting options including possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over the differential between soybean and product  taxes which Buenos Aires levies on exports.     The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S. officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina\'s differential export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in competition with the U.S.     \"Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict (Argentine) access to our market,\" said one U.S. source.         The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to end the differential.     But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88 year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.     Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not narrow the differential further for 1987/88.     As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.

'Mounting trade friction between the U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia\'s exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said.     They told correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S. Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.     But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo\'s loss might be their gain.     The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in retaliation for Japan\'s alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.     Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes.     \"We wouldn\'t be able to do business,\" said a spokesman for leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd MC.T.     \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,\" said Tom Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker James Capel and Co.     In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.     \"We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to us,\" said a senior Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.     Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.     The surplus helped swell Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world\'s largest.     \"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,\" said Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters Taiwan Safe Group.

Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.     In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U.S.     In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further U.S. Pressure to block imports.     \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.     \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said.

He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday, he said.     Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan, but would have to coordinate action with its European Community partners.     Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as it has threatened.  \n',trade
'Australian Minister for Trade Negotiations Michael Duffy said his country and Third World commodity producers have formed an effective lobby group against farm export subsidies and market access restrictions.     Duffy told a press conference the Cairns Group of 14 major agricultural producers, to which Australia and Thailand belong, has emerged as an important third force in any multilateral trade talks. \"There\'s no doubt that the Cairns Group is being seen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in other international trade negotiations,\" he said.     Duffy, here on a three-day visit after talks in the United States, The European Community (EC) and Latin America, said considerable progress has been made by the group towards fighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed countries.     The minister said the EC Commission\'s new farm trade paper will recognise the heavy financial burdens imposed by its Common Agricultural Policy and its future expansion.     He said the Reagan Administration has also displayed a determination to resist the currently strong protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress.  \n',trade

'Canada has threatened to stop imports of Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish agriculture ministry official tolds.     The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached for support.     Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: \"Denmark will not accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC.\"     Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.     Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.     But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC regulations. \"Canadian officials are very concerned about the trade implications. We are holding active discussions with the EC and bilaterally,\" she added.  \n',trade
'Canada plans to monitor steel shipments flowing in and out of the country in an attempt to appease concerns in the U.S. over the high level of Canadian steel exports, Trade Minister Pat Carney said.     \"To help maintain our open access to the U.S. steel market, the government is taking further action to ensure we have more accurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is not used as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,\" Carney said.     Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to exercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries were considering establishing a joint commission to study the growing steel problem.     Carney told the House of Commons she will soon announce an amendment to the Exports and Imports Permits Act to set up the monitoring program.     Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct cent of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the level just two years ago, Canadian trade officials said.     The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from several countries in the face of a decline in the domestic steel industry.     Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada\'s share of the American market be limited to 2.4 pct.  \n',trade
'Canada\'s trade picture has brightened considerably, underscoring economists\' predictions the sector would post a long awaited recovery this year.     The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February, double January\'s 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986\'s 189 mln dlr tally.     \"Hopefully it\'s the beginning of a trend,\" said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.     Economists generally don\'t expect such large gains over the next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year.     \"We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year, and it certainly looks as if this morning\'s figure is indicative of that,\" commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.     Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month.     \"Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in February,\" the agency said in its monthly report.     Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.     Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year\'s dismal 10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion dlrs.     Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.     The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading.     Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy.     Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.     The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading.     Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy.     They say the country\'s consumers, who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country.     Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United States, by far the country\'s largest market, is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.     \"We maintain what\'s going to drive Canada\'s export performance is income growth in the U.S.,\" said Midland\'s Donegan.     But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February\'s trade upturn.     Jestin said, \"Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate that part of the strength (in Canada\'s trade figures) is probably transitory.\"  \n',trade

'China\'s trade deficit in the first quarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same 1986 period, customs figures show.     Zhang Zhongji, spokesman of the State Statistical Bureau, quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28 billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.     He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only 350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their level at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.     Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.     Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved incentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain more foreign exchange from the goods they sell.     He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose 35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46 billion. Exports to Japan fell 2.3 pct to 1.28 billion and imports 24.4 pct to 2.14 billion.     Exports to the U.S. Rose 23 pct to 640 mln dlrs and imports fell 26.7 pct to 840 mln.

'The European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC officials said.     Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat, fish and cereals by-products.     But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the officials said.     The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.     Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat, saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500 tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.     Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.     The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal\'s entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).     But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country\'s EC membership.     Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada.     Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC claims that Spain and Portugal\'s entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation.     Japan\'s main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.

'The European Community (EC) has effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its market to imports before it decides on possible tough retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.     They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26 to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.     The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are \"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.\"     Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese exports.     The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action.     They said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.     In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.

'The European Community launched an investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark an intensification of world trade strains.     Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the U.S.     The EC Executive Commission said today the European Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.     Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the Japanese.     The Commission said it believed the Association had given sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found the complaints were justified.

EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S. Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones, the spokesman said.     Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S. Manufacturers.

'The European Community (EC) accused the United States of violating a political commitment to free trade through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a customs user fee.     EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.     Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to improve its balance of payments.     The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules by restricting imports of agricultural products through an import licensing system. The United States asked for consultations with Tokyo on the issue.     Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers, pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.     When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT jargon as \"standstill and rollback.\"     Tran criticised Washington for the \"superfund\" tax on oil imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government procurement list for reasons of national security.     Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.     The surveillance body will send a record of today\'s talks to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round, to decide any further action on the charges.     The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.     The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel\'s report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its legislation.

Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.     The scheme replaces current rules which allow different amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.     RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value of annual export earnings.     These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil, psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.     RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.     Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.  \n',trade
'With more private investment, not more protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two congressional agencies said today.     The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S. textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for optimism than a few years ago.     \"While textile producers are making significant investments, they could do more,\" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.     The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than increased trade protection which could lead to foreign retaliation.     CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections, first imposed in the 1950\'s have had only a small benefit for profits and investments of domestic firms.     Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against congressional approval of protectionist textile quota legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other Asian textile producing countries.     President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is expected to be voted on in the House this year.     However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles showed a weakening of support for the legislation.     Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic markets, Kelly said.     He added that private investment in the textile and clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.     Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.     \"The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered, and that exports can be expanded,\" Kelly said.  \n',trade
'Israel\'s exports to the U.S. can and must double over the next five years if the mideast nation\'s goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad Yaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.     Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S. were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel\'s total exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.     \"I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis on product quality,\" Yaacobi said.     While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European currencies is a \"bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,\" Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend toward higher U.S. exports.     In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.     Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.      He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would continue to facilitate the desired export growth.     Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S. firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.     Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able to achieve its economic potential.     Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing military conflicts \"which were imposed on Israel,\" he said.     Short of achieving Israel\'s full growth potential, however, Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.  \n',trade
'Italy\'s Foreign Trade Minister Mario Sarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press, said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign securities.     Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month\'s overall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April\'s 2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign securities purchases.    \"The deficit can be better attributed to premature and delayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags) rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment,\" Sarcinelli said in a statement.     Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by the Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and said it had been partly caused by \"non-banking capital outflows.\"     \"In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flow of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our borders,\" said the newspaper.

The plan will also urge the government to double 1985\'s official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior LDP officials said at a press conference.     LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain the plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.     Abe\'s visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.     Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated. However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe will be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.     The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by the government will probably include the purchase of super computers, LDP officials said.     According to the plan, Japan will also strive to solve specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.     The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and lessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.     The basic ideas of the LDP\'s plan were presented to and welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial nations in Washington last week, they said.     The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be unveiled by the government in late May.  \n',trade
'Basic reform of Japan\'s protected farm sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade surplus, securities analysts said.     The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they said.     \"In economic terms, reform would be a plus,\" said Christopher Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.     The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S., The analysts said.     Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the average household\'s budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.     Reducing these prices could increase household spending power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on products which would have a more direct impact in boosting domestic growth, it added.     \"There\'s a lot of slack,\" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo said. \"All that money could be spent on something else.\"     Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37 billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.     Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential development would also give a boost to domestic spending, economists said.     \"Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the expansion of domestic demand,\" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor at Kyoto Gakuen University.     Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the farm sector. Employers groups also want change. \"If you really want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,\" Bumpei Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers\' Associations told a recent press conference.     External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade deficits with Japan.     But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.     Although the full-time farm population is falling and there are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.     The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon, the analysts said.     Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for national food security, they said.     Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.     Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.  \n',trade
'A top U.S. Official said Japan has little chance of persuading the U.S. to drop threatened trade sanctions, despite the efforts of a Japanese team that left for Washington today.     Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, was asked at a press conference whether Japan\'s moves to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could persuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports said, and replied: \"...It is probably too early for the figures to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to permit the result you have described.\"     Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.     \"There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area, but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on security and political issues,\" he said.     \"The question is whether through cooperative actions between our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist legislation,\" he said.  \n',trade
'Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports.     Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan\'s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.     The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japan\'s failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.     They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers.     Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.     President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement.     In making the annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade.\"     Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan\'s semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.     Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan\'s inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.     About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.     Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.     Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.     He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan\'s decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI\'s power to control Japanese traders.     \"The United States has excessive expectations.,\" he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.\"     He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.  \n',trade
'Japan\'s Agriculture Ministry, angered by U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan, a senior ministry official said.     \"Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers,\" the official, who declined to be named, said. \"Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market,\" he said.     Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S. Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers.     Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said. End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.     U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.     Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31.     Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.     U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.     An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S. Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business.     The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices, purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts, prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.     To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan\'s top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products.     But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector.     \"Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these issues should not be discussed on the same table,\" the official said.  \n',trade
'Japan must try harder to reduce its trade surplus or the yen will come under renewed upward pressure, Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo.     He told a press luncheon he hoped Japan could cut its current account surplus by some 10 billion dlrs a year until it is reduced to some 50 to 60 billion dlrs. In the fiscal year ended March 31 the surplus totalled 93.76 billion dlrs, or about 4.5 pct of GNP.     The 6,000 billion yen economic stimulation package the government unveiled late last month would help slash Japan\'s current account surplus by five to six billion dlrs, he said.  \n',trade
'Japan\'s trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct.     But it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988, \"thus weakening the international adjustment process.\"     It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.     The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.     The OECD outlook said, \"Continued large current account surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen.\" It said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth.     The OECD said Japan\'s Gross National Product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986\'s 2.5 pct growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a 0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.  \n',trade
'Japan warned the United States it may take retaliatory measures if the United States imposes its planned trade sanctions on April 17, a senior government official said.     Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Trade and Industry Ministry, said in a statement Japan would consider measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on some Japanese exports as planned next week.     However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.     Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called Japan\'s failure to honour a July 1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the United States and to open its home market to American goods.     Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not listened to Japan\'s explanation of its efforts to live up the pact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanation of why it planned to impose the tariffs.  \n',trade

'The tough trade sanctions President Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across Japan\'s bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.     But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings Institution, a think tank, said \"a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern.\"     He said it left the United States open to retaliation.     The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws, and no new protectionist legislation is needed.     In the past year tough trade action had been taken against the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights, patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a \"serious signal\" to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.     Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers, television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the American consumer, Fitzwater said.     Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.     The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.     The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about one-third of America\'s overall deficit.     But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all.     Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that \"I regret that these actions are necessary,\" but that the health and vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to American competitiveness in world markets.     \"We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices,\" Reagan added in the statement from his California vacation home at Santa Barbara.     He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan abided by the agreement.     U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress - which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.     The White House aide said of the tariff action, \"it wasn\'t done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade practice.\"     The aide added, however, \"on another plane, it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws.\"     But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the United States, and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.     \"It\'s very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,\" he said, \"because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade.\"     Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country, and therefore its impact on Congress.\"     He said, \"I don\'t think it makes a lot of sense.\"     But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress, and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.     Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don\'t want a trade war,\" but the imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

'A group of Latin American and Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.     Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of American States special committee on trade, said he was aware of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added \"the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills.\"     He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit, and \"it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests.\"     Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.     Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large, annual trade surpluses with the United States.     Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States, but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2 billion dlrs, against Japan\'s of 58.6 billion dlrs.     The European Community has also opposed the bills.     Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration\'s opposition to many of the sections in the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.     He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor, expected next week.     Rodriguez said \"the region needs trade to continue development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation.\"     Rodriguez said: \"we need to keep the market opens - especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress.\"     President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed \"protectionist,\" and his aides now are mounting a effort to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the legislation.

'Pakistani government allowed freer cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed at narrowing the country\'s yawning trade gap.     Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech the government had also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of Pakistani products.         Cotton and rice are Pakistan\'s main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s.     But Haq said now the private sector would also export cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a long-standing demand of the local traders.     The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries compete effectively in the world market, he said.         Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but reviewed every year.     It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a longer period.

He said the government policy was to rationalise and streamline import controls.     \"It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports, specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,\" he said. \"Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise to smuggling and hampering of exports.\"         He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed from import restrictions.

'President Reagan today is to announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls Japan\'s failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade.     The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative\'s Office.     Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film.     The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.     In his March annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.\"     He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.     U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagan\'s plan to invoke the sanctions.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  \"we do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action.\"     Reagan\'s move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits, with last year\'s hitting a record $169.8 billion.     About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.     Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.     He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.     Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation.     The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the results showed up.     U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.     Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT).     It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.     U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States.  \n',trade

The U.S. Deficit, which we all decry, has been in a sense the place into which everyone\'s export-led strategy for growth has gone.\"     \"The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed on this deficit, so something will have to give and it will be possibly a traumatic experience,\" he added.     \"While you must keep up the pressure on us to eschew protectionist policies, you must act too,\" Shultz said.     \"I can do a better job of convincing the Congress to leave our door open to imports if more of our trading partners open their doors wider,\" he told the group, which included representatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the European Community.  \n',trade
'U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz warned members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) they could no longer rely on increased exports to the U.S. For growth.     \"Given the importance of exports, particularly export manufactures, to all of your countries, you are going to have to work hard to diversify your markets,\" he said.     \"While you may be able to maintain your current market share in the U.S., You clearly will not be able to look to the U.S. To take major increases in your exports,\" he added.     Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand the U.S. Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many now believed.     He said ASEAN\'s looming trade problems would not necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being contemplated by Congress, \"but simply because of the adjustments the U.S. Economy will have to make in order to service our large and growing external debt.\"     Shultz said the U.S. Deficit had resulted not from falling exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth.  \n',trade
'U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last week went further than the U.S. Had expected.     But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.     Speaking in a televised news conference linking several European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and global demand.      \"There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was originally thought,\" said Shultz, speaking from Washington.     \"It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.     \"It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the economy,\" he added.     But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might decide at next week\'s Venice summit to lift its sanctions on some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:     \"These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an agreement that had been reached between the United States and Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip market.     \"They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the agreement that it made become evident.\"     He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a trend on only one month\'s data.     The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that Japan had violated last September\'s bilateral agreement by selling computer chips at below fair market value.     Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.     Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the problem.     He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would contain a major reduction.  \n',trade

'South Korea\'s trade surplus is growing too fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.     He told a press conference the government planned to increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus \"at a proper level.\"     But he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.     The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.     Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years.     \"Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now the surplus is growing faster than we expected,\" he said.     Trade ministry officials said South Korea\'s exports rose 35 pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.     Kim said the swing of South Korea\'s current account to a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time.     South Korea\'s foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest in Asia.     \"This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development... Last year was a major turning point for the Korean economy,\" Kim said.     Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country\'s GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from about 50 pct in 1986.     \"The government, however, does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,\" he said.     Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with Seoul\'s major trading partners, particularly the United States.     \"We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a proper level,\" Kim said.  \n',trade

Moscow\'s trade surplus with East Bloc countries continued to grow in 1986.     Western analysts attributed the deficit rise with the West to the world oil price slump, which hit Moscow\'s main export and cut hard currency earnings needed for purchases in the West.  \n',trade

'Taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with Washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the United States.     Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry\'s Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington.     \"The move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United States,\" he said.     He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct.     The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added.     Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the island\'s largest trading partner.     Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with Taipei.     Washington\'s deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year earlier, Taiwan\'s official figures show.     Today\'s announcement came before a departure later today of a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of trade talks with U.S. Officials.     The delegation\'s leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last night he was leaving with \"a heavy heart,\" meaning that he would face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan\'s 1986 trade surplus with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.     Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S. Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products, purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment, import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.     \"I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from our talks with the U.S.,\" he said without elaborating.  \n',trade

It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht from 58.7 billion. Thailand\'s improved business climate this year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials and semi-finished products.     The country\'s oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the first quarter due to lower oil prices.     The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6 billion baht from 56.6 billion.     Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower earnings from many key commodities including rice whose earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26 pct and canned pineapples seven pct.     Products registering high export growth were jewellery up 64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.  \n',trade
'Toshiba Corp TSBA.T and Sharp Corp SHRP.T decided to maintain exports of lap-top personal computers to the European Community (EC) at last year\'s levels, despite the halt of shipments to the U.S., Company spokesmen tolds.

The Europeans feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April.     Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the personal computer market in the EC, the Sharp spokesman said.     Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers would continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being.     Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top personal computers would continue at last year\'s level of 12,000 to 16,000 units a year.     Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan\'s alleged failure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade.  \n',trade
'Member states of the European Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.     Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.     However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.    Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.     The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S.     The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC\'s trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March, up from 1.94 billion in February.  \n',trade

'The Administration asked Congress to replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.     The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.     Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they should pay about the same rates of duties.     Yeutter said, \"American exporters will find it far easier to deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of differing systems which they now face.\"     He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.     Yeutter said government and business moves are based on data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.     He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under the new system, with about half expected to join the system by January 1988.  \n',trade
'The Commerce Department said on that insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1 billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.     The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after the initial trade report to issue a second report on a \"customs value\" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance charges from the cost of imports.     Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.     A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been revised downward.     The Commerce department would like to have the law changed to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.     \"My feeling is the second one is a better report but there\'s legislation that requires us to delay it two days,\" said Robert Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.     \"But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays any attention to the second figure.\"     The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.     The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in 1979.     Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison with other countries that reported their trade balances on the same basis.     The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration.     Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.     \"We\'re considering it,\" he said, \"It\'s one of those dinosaur laws and I think it\'s time has come.\"     The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration.

Previously, the initial monthly figure has had to be revised in subsequent months because of the time lag between the report and the compiling of final estimates on imports and exports.

'The United States may lift an additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later this month, Reagan Administration officials said.     President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.     The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and portable computers.     Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at below production costs.     Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.     The Administration officials said Commerce Department  monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking sales away from American-made semiconductors.     They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would be lifted by the end of the month.     The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.     U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan\'s compliance with the agreement earlier this week.     The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.  \n',trade

A British parliamentary report said that up to March British firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of contracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure.     The committee said U.S. Technology export restrictions and \"selectiveness\" towards foreign contractors had denied British competitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them from technological research for SDI.     Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts under conditions of fair and open competition. \"All we ask is for our companies to be given similar opportunities,\" he added.

'The use of tariffs and quotas to reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do little to cut the nation\'s swelling trade deficit, a government study said.     In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said, such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re-exported in different forms.     \"Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,\" it said.     The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.     Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.     \"Although each industry\'s competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find that there have been no significant industry-specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit,\" the study said.     \"To the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,\" the FTC study said.     Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.     It also said it found a \"fairly direct relationship\" between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign consumer demand.     The study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.     In each case, the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.  \n',trade
'The United States is prepared to \"pull out all the stops\" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador to GATT Michael Samuels said.     Those rights are now being challenged by the European Community\'s (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.     He reiterated Washington\'s firm intention to retaliate if the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.     The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat shipments into the EC.     The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S. trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed prices over the current market level and which may be extended to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.     Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies, an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade negotiations, \"is meaningless if import barriers continue to be erected,\" Samuels said.     Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, \"visionary\" and \"very serious.\"  The EC and Japan have said it is unrealistic.     The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally next week.     The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of farm subsidies.     The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major trade distortions, Samuels said.     Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally submitted and respond to it officially then.     \"We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,\" the U.S. Ambassador said.     The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.     The key difference between the two approaches is that the U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.     If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze, there would be little incentive for the Community to work to correct the international trade situation, he added.     Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.  \n',trade
'A trade bill before the United States House of Representatives \"is a very dangerous bill for Canadian industry,\" Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told reporters.     By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S. countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3 removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.     \"Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language,\" he said.     The Canadian forest lobby\'s Zimmerman also said the House of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian resource exports to the U.S.     Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber to the U.S., Zimmerman added.     Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S. forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.     \"We represent the first victim of the move to price other countries\' natural resources according to the U.S. system,\" Zimmerman said.     \"If we\'re an example, than other resource industries had better watch out,\" he added.     Zimmerman said the Canadian Forest Industry Council plans to discuss concerns about the U.S. trade bill with lobby groups from other Canadian resource industries.  \n',trade
'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.     Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry\'s Economic Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help Japan as well as the United States.     The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.     However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was already the world\'s largest grain importer.     Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food requirements in 1985.     Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on beef, citrus products and rice.     Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice because potential production is higher than domestic demand.     The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of rising production by exporting countries, he added.     Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product output with expensive programs, Maki said.

'The White House has completed a new review of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan last April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.     They said the president\'s Economic Policy Council looked at Japan\'s adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.     But there was no hint what the announcement might be.     Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.     But they also noted that the White House has said it was unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the world\'s seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.     The officials added that while the curbs complicated U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt  Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.     Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for Japan\'s failure to honor commitments to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs and to open its own market to U.S. goods.     The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television sets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.

But Cato chairman William Niskanen added \"the two nations\' generally harmonious trade relations are probably not sustainable without a new agreement.\"     The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers remaining between their two countries.     The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining remained.     Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and this could hit some Canadian trade practices.     He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.     Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S. exports to Canada.     A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.     It would also increase the gross national products of both countries.     Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.  \n',trade
'The United Arab Emirates (UAE) recorded a 1986 trade surplus of 12.2 billion dirhams, narrowing from 30.2 billion in 1985, the central bank\'s latest bulletin shows.     The central bank said the lower surplus was mainly due to the decline in the value of exports and reexports to 37.2 billion dirhams from 54.2 billion in 1985. This reflected the decline in oil prices last year and difficulties in marketing UAE oil, the central bank added.     The surplus on the current account narrowed to 6.8 billion dirhams from 25.5 billion in 1985. The overall balance showed a surplus of 4.8 billion after 2.6 billion in 1985.  \n',trade
'Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the global trading system.     He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.     The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it trade in agriculture and services such as banking.     Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.     The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and many services.     Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli pacts \"other countries have realized that if they want to continue to have access to the world\'s largest market, they had better get serious about improving the GATT.\"     The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially increase the gross national products in both countries.     Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.     Yeutter said, \"increasing trade is one of the keys to enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.\"     He said, \"a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries that need to increase trade in order to better their standards of living.\"     Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to protectionism.     He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions against nations with large trade surpluses with the United States if the countries practiced unfair trade.     The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still rising.     Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President Reagan\'s efforts to liberalize the world trade.     Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.     He said, \"President Reagan will veto any bill that contains serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.\"  \n',trade
'The White House said high U.S. Tariffs on Japanese electronic goods would likely be imposed as scheduled on April 17, despite an all-out effort by Japan to avoid them.     Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater made the remark one day before U.S. And Japanese officials are to meet under the emergency provisions of a July 1986 semiconductor pact to discuss trade and the punitive tariffs.     Fitzwater said: \"I would say Japan is applying the full-court press...They certainly are putting both feet forward in terms of explaining their position.\" But he added that \"all indications are they (the tariffs) will take effect.\"  \n',trade

'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was almost sure Japan would not retaliate against tariffs President Reagan slapped on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese electronic goods today.     \"I\'d say it\'s 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) will not provoke a retaliation on American products,\" Yeutter told Cable News Network.     \"Japan has far too much at stake in this relationship (with the United States) to seriously entertain thoughts of retaliation,\" Yeutter said.     Earlier today, Reagan  imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan\'s alleged violation of a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade.     Yeutter did say that U.S. farm products would be targeted if Tokyo decided to hit back.     \"If they (Japan) were to retaliate, it would probably be on something like American agricultural products,\" he said.     \"But I really think the chances of that happening are between slim and none,\" he added.  \n',trade
'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.     Asked in a television interview what the chance was for Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese electronic exports, he said \"slim to none.\"     Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to retaliate for Japan\'s failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.     Yeutter, on the NBC program \"Today,\" said the United States did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.     He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take time to monitor any compliance.     Asked how long that would take, he said \"We want to see a pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would take a few weeks.\"     Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods because the items selected are also readily available from other countries and manufacturers.     He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.     \"It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that full well,\" Yeutter said.     He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but \"that\'s more of a paper kind of exercise and I don\'t really expect to see any adverse impact on U.S. trade.\"     Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.     He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a major issue, would be productive but \"I don\'t see any practical way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his visit.\"  \n',trade
'National Bank economic data for 1986 shows that Yugoslavia\'s trade deficit grew, the inflation rate rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and the value of the dinar fell.     The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.     Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.     Yugoslavia\'s balance of payments surplus with the convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344 mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.     Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank\'s data showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.     Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.     Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages were too high given the level of productivity.     Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.     Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9 billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs abroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.     The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard currencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against the Swiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar, 46.2 pct.  \n',trade
'Developing countries said the European Community (EC) would breach two international agreements if it went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.     Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the exports of 26 ACP countries.     They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect trade between the two sides.     They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.     The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could raise up to two billion Ecus a year.     EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax, are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on June 15.     Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its member country exports.     \"We can\'t believe the EC would willingly take measures to undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these measures,\" Wilson said.     The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it is approved.     Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only \"as a very last resort,\" but added that the ACP is in touch with other countries which oppose the plan.     Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats.     Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast, Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.  \n',veg-oil
'A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for soybeans should help boost 1987 U.S. Soybean exports to Taiwan, a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers tolds.     He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by the cabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.     The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987 soybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, he said. The previous target for 1987 was 1.81 tonnes.     Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from the U.S. And the rest from South America.     The spokesman said the increase in imports from the U.S. Is in line with government efforts to reduce Taiwan\'s trade surplus with Washington, which rose to 3.61 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year ago.     \"The tariff cut is very helpful for American suppliers (who want) to boost their exports to Taiwan,\" Steve Chen, country director of the American Soybean Association, tolds.  \n',veg-oil
