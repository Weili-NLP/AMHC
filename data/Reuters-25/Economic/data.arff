'Australia\'s current deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in February from 1.23 billion (revised from 1.29 billion) in January, the Statistics Bureau said.     This compared with an 897 mln dlr shortfall a year earlier.     February merchandise trade recorded a 42 mln dlr surplus against a 246 mln shortfall (revised from 287 mln) in January and a 162 mln deficit in February 1986.     The current account deficit fell at the lower end of the range of forecasts of 700 mln to one billion dlrs made by market economists yesterday.     February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion dlrs from 2.74 billion (revised from 2.72 billion) in January and 2.54 billion a year earlier while FOB imports fell to 2.77 billion from 2.99 billion (revised from 3.01 billion) against 2.70 billion a year earlier, the Bureau said.     It said a four pct decline in rural exports, despite an 11 pct rise in wheat exports, was more than offset by a seven pct rise in non-rural exports, notably minerals and fuels.     On the import side, the main decreases were falls of 17 pct in machinery and transport equipment and 21 pct in fuels, the Bureau said.     The net services deficit narrowed to 146 mln dlrs from 253 mln (revised from 268 mln) in January and 192 mln a year earlier, the Bureau said.     This made a sharply lower deficit of 104 mln dlrs on the balance of goods and services against deficits of 499 mln in January and 354 mln a year earlier.     Deficit on net income and unrequited transfers was 646 mln dlrs against 736 mln in January and 543 mln a year earlier.     Official capital transactions in February showed a surplus of 786 mln dlrs against a 2.56 billion surplus in January and a 505 mln surplus a year earlier.     Non-official capital and balancing item showed a 36 mln dlr deficit against a 1.33 billion deficit in January and a 392 mln surplus in February 1986, the Bureau said.     The cumulative current account deficit for the first eight months of fiscal 1986/87 ending June 30 widened to 9.37 billion dlrs from 9.32 billion a year earlier.     The cumulative trade deficit narrowed to 2.09 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion and the services deficit to 2.25 billion from 2.75 billion but the transfers deficit widened to 5.03 billion from 4.36 billion. The cumulative official capital surplus narrowed to 2.90 billion dlrs from 3.86 billion.  \n',bop
'Australia\'s current account deficit for February is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln and one billion dlrs, from the unrevised January level of 1.29 billion, market economists polled bys said.     Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow.     The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January, after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598 mln dlrs.     As an example they quoted wheat export volume, which rose about 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January.     A lack of aircraft imports in February should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit, the economists said.     Other positive influences on the current account balance should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of certain official aid payments, they said.     They said the Australian dollar, which last week touched an eight-month high of 0.6900 U.S. Dlrs but is now around the 0.6800 level, should not react adversely to the figures unless the current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs.  \n',bop
'Canada\'s current account deficit widened to a seasonally adjusted 2.27 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter from a deficit of 1.94 billion dlrs in the third, Statistics Canada said.     The shortfall for the full year rose to 8.81 billion dlrs from 1985\'s 584 mln dlr deficit, the federal agency said.     The agency said the rise in the merchandise surplus, to 2.77 billion dlrs from 2.20 billion dlrs in the third quarter, was more than offset by high deficits in servicies and investment. The total non-merchandise deficit grew to 5.04 billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs.     The current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1985.     In the capital account, not seasonally adjusted, there was a total net inflow of 4.76 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, up from a net inflow of 3.22 billion dlrs in the third quarter quarter.     The total net capital inflow rose to 13.74 billion dlrs in 1986 from 7.68 billion dlr in 1985.  \n',bop
'Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said today\'s downgrading of Denmark\'s credit rating by Standard and Poor\'s Corp should not be over-dramatised.     Standard and Poor\'s said it had downgraded the Kingdom of Denmark\'s long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, following the country\'s loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983.     \"This change is regrettable but there is no reason to dramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor\'s defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top AAA rating,\" Simonsen said in a statement.     \"The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing capability is unlikely to be very great. But if, against expectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external account deficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and capability,\" he added.     \"Standard &amp; Poor\'s has noted that in 1986 there was a series of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and encourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect.     \"If and when it becomes necessary, the government will be ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives as it has in the past,\" Simonsen said.    Standard and Poor\'s said weaker international competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external debt.     The external current account deficit rose to a record preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in 1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns, according to government statistics.     Government economists forecast that the external current account deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year.     Denmark\'s net foreign debt rose to 129 pct of total exports in 1986 from 83 pct in 1983, S and P said.  \n',bop
'The Dutch current account surplus fell 5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billion guilders, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.     The surplus is expected to fall further in 1987, the statement said, but gave no details. Earlier today, the official planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus to fall to six billion guilders during 1987.     The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6 billion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining terms of exchange, while more goods were imported as consumer spending and investment increased.     While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion guilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay between the fall in oil and gas prices.     The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on invisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the Finance Ministry said, noting the surplus on transport services was reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price falls.     The fourth quarter current account showed a deficit, for the first time since 1980, of 700 mln guilders, it said.  \n',bop
'China\'s foreign debt reached 27 billion dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to short-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign bankers and Chinese officials tolds.     Foreign bankers said China\'s total debt rose sharply from an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low, between eight and 10 pct.     China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said.     Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on 1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct.     Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.     A Western banker said China\'s portfolio contains too much short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive low interest rates in the Japanese market.     The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.     A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the country\'s total debt at about 30 pct.     The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.     \"Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China, which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread,\" he said.     The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is in part a result of China\'s inexperience in the foreign capital markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.     \"Officials do not think of China but of their own department or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the full backing of the People\'s Republic of China,\" he said.     \"The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to exercise indirect controls,\" he said.     The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the past six weeks that China\'s foreign borrowing will not be affected by a drive against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a phrase meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16.     A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China\'s foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially stated figure of 10 billion dlrs.     \"The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in advance of an announcement the reserves were down,\" he said.     The banker said such buying has not been going on. \"Things are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in 1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development.\"     Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985.     A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official said this year\'s outlook for exports, which account for more than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier than a year ago.     The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It was quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago.     The official said China has taken measures to improve its export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and the establishment of export production bases.     \"We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year,\" he added.     Official estimates put China\'s 1986 export losses from the drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs.     A Western diplomat said China\'s foreign debt needs careful management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six to eight pct.     \"We base our assessment not on China\'s foreign exchange reserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a company on its performance, not its bank account,\" he said.     He said China performed very well in the export field last year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have few difficulties in increasing its borrowing.  \n',bop
'The net inflow of foreign investment into Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billion a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said.     The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08 billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billion turnaround in direct investment.     The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a 520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account of government foreign currency borrowings, it said.     Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billion dlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal in the third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourth quarter of 1985, the Bureau said.     It said the major part of the turnaround reflected an injection of funds, estimated at around 700 mln dlrs, associated with the previously reported restructuring of the Australian operations of General Motors Corp GM.     GM used the funds to pay out or take over certain Australian liabilities of its local unit General Motors-Holden\'s Ltd, it said.     However, net borrowings remained the major part of total inflow, accounting for 6.16 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter against 3.88 billion in the third quarter and 4.03 billion a year earlier, the Bureau said.     Net official borrowings comprised 1.52 billion dlrs against a net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mln inflow a year earlier.     Total private and semi-public authority net borrowings rose to 4.64 billion dlrs from 4.42 billion in the third quarter and 3.51 billion a year earlier.  \n',bop
'The French 1986 current account balance of payments surplus has been revised slightly upwards to 25.8 billion francs from the 25.4 billion franc figure announced last month, the Finance Ministry said.     This compares with a 1.5 billion deficit in 1985, and while it is the first surplus since 1979, is substantially lower than the 50 billion surplus forecast by the previous socialist government before they lost office in March last year.     Net long-term capital outflows rose sharply to 70.5 billion francs last year from 8.8 billion in 1985, largely due to a major program of foreign debt repayment, the ministry said.     In the fourth quarter alone the unadjusted surplus rose to 14.1 billion francs from 6.6 billion the previous quarter, but the adjusted surplus fell to 7.4 billion from 9.1 billion.     Fourth quarter medium and long-term foreign debt repayments exceeded new credits by 11 billion francs.  \n',bop
'France\'s current account payments surplus slipped to a provisional 300 mln francs, seasonally adjusted, in January from a downward revised surplus of 3.8 billion in December, the Finance Ministry said.     The December figure was revised from a provisional 4.8 billion franc surplus reported a month ago.     On an unadjusted basis, January payments showed a 5.2 billion franc deficit after a revised 7.1 billion December surplus. The December unadjusted surplus was revised down from a provisional 8.2 billion.     The Ministry said trade, measured on balance of payments criteria, showed an unadjusted 7.1 billion franc January deficit while services showed a 3.7 billion surplus.     Other items, mainly including unilateral transfers, showed a 1.8 billion deficit.     The current account showed an adjusted surplus of 6.1 billion francs in January last year, and an unadjusted deficit of one billion.     The full year 1986 current account surplus was reported last month at 25.8 billion francs.  \n',bop
'West Germany\'s current account surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in February from a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, a spokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said.     The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4 billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.     The Statistics Office had originally put the January current account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.     The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billion mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the current account surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus recorded in February 1986.     A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the February current account surplus compared with January was due to seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current account figures are seasonally adjusted.     February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled 32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986 but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.     Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56 billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct compared with January.     The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate the real change in exports and imports in February. But for comparison purposes it noted that in January the average value of imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average value of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.     Within the current account, the services account had 300 mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark surplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark deficit.     Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in value terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a year earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks, a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.     The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for January/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1 billion marks in the year-ago period.     The cumulative current account surplus for January and February 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion marks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.     Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as seasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlier this week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against January while export prices were unchanged.     \"The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend that is not expected to change for several months at least,\" said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987 as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record 112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.     An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) in Frankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a more accurate picture of West Germany\'s trade position.     He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January and February together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus posted in November and December.     \"The trend is clearly lower,\" he said.     This economist, who declined to be named, said the February rise was also partly explained by special factors in January, when there had been a number of public holidays as well as extremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.  \n',bop
'The inflow of long-term capital into West Germany slumped to 606 mln marks in February from January\'s record 11.91 billion, with foreign purchases of German bonds and shares declining sharply, the Bundesbank said.     While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth of German bonds in February after 13 billion in January, they sold a net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of public authorities after sales worth 300 mln in January.     With German investors\' purchases of foreign securities steady around 1.3 billion marks, only 2.2 billion marks were imported through securities transactions, after 11.2 billion.     Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60 billion marks in February after 2.83 billion in January.     There was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short-term capital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January.     Banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds while domestic companies increased their short-term financial assets abroad by 700 mln. But public authorities received some one billion marks from abroad, the Bundesbank said in a statement.     Combining long and short term capital outflows, West Germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks in February against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January.     The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widened to 10.45 billion marks in February from January\'s 7.20 billion.     Taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. In terms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing of the surplus was progressing, the bank said.     Germany\'s current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion marks in February from 4.79 billion in January, but was down on the 7.26 billion figure for February 1986. Seasonally adjusted, the February current account surplus narrowed against January.     While exports in February fell a half pct against the same month last year, imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to the drop in prices. Exports grew three pct in volume and imports two pct.     In the balance of services, a fall in net investment income led to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln mark surplus in January.     The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion marks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3 billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the European Community budget.  \n',bop

'The Australian dollar rose more than 40 points and money market interest rates retreated on the better than expected improvement in the February current account deficit, but economists and dealers were cautious about identifying it as the start of a downward trend.     The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in February from 1.23 billion in January. It hit 13.82 billion dlrs in 1985/86 to end-June.     The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded as high as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69.     \"It\'s got 69 cents written all over it,\" one dealer said.     Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30 points to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release.     The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one billion dlrs for March.     Banque National de Paris BNPP.A senior dealer Peter Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and interest rates were too high for import substitution and export industries.     Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875 and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow.     Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at 2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January.     But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal exports remained poor. \"We should remember we are paying something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near term,\" Buttrose said.     Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln dlrs, and added \"Any figure under a billion dollars will be acceptable (to the markets).\"     ANZ Banking Group Ltd ANZA.S senior economist Ian Little said the big question was whether the improvement in exports could be sustained. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion dlrs from a revised 2.74 billion in January.     Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news, with 90-day bank bill yields falling to 16.42-16.45 pct from early highs of 16.50 and yields yesterday as high as 16.65.     Longer term yields fell with 10-year bonds at 13.66/68 pct from 13.74 before the release and highs of 13.87 yesterday.

'Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said.     He tolds the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985, which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.     Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year.     This year\'s target of 20 pct \"might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful,\" he said.     Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government\'s economic planning, said Turkey\'s creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.     \"We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years,\" he added.     His comment echoed last October\'s Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said Ankara\'s case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.     \"In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit,\" he said.     Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits.     Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.     \"We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,\" he said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986.     More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage exports, and production incentives were being considered.     \"We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned,\" Tigrel said.     He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible.  \n',bop
'The U.S. current account deficit widened to a record 36.84 billion dlrs on a balance of payments basis in the October-December fourth quarter of 1986 from a revised 35.29 billion dlrs in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said.     Previously, the department said the third-quarter deficit was 36.28 billion dlrs.     For the full year 1986, the current account, a broad measure of trade performance, was in deficit a record 140.57 billion dlrs after a 117.68 billion dlr deficit in 1985.     The department said an increase in the merchandise trade deficit during the fourth quarter to 38.4 billion dlrs from 37.1 billion dlrs in the third quarter was the main reason for the worsening deficit.     Net service receipts declined to 5.5 billion dlrs in the final quarter from six billion dlrs in the third quarter.     The current account includes trade in merchandise and services as well as U.S. financial transactions with the rest of the world.     The department said the merchandise trade deficit for all of 1986 grew to 147.7 billion from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985.     Net service receipts were 22.3 billion dlrs in 1986, compared with 21.7 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said.     Net unilateral transfers during the fourth quarter last year, covering foreign aid and government pensions, were down to 3.9 billion dlrs from 4.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter because of fewer U.S. government grants to Mideast countries.     Liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S. banks rose 35.3 billion dlrs between October and December after increasing 30.1 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     For the full year, these liabilities grew 77.4 billion dlrs after rising by 40.4 billion dlrs in 1985.     The department said inflows were boosted in the fourth quarter by international activities of Japanese banks and strong demand within the United States to finance acquisitions.     Net foreign sales of U.S. Treasury securities by foreigners were 2.7 billion dlrs in the quarter after purchases of 500 mln dlrs in the third quarter.     Net foreign purchases of securities other than U.S. Treasury securities in the fourth quarter were 11.8 billion dlrs, compared with 17.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     For all 1986, foreign purchases of securities excluding U.S. Treasury securities were a record 70.7 billion dlrs, surpassing the previous record 50.9 billion dlr total in 1985.    Claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks in the fourth quarter rose 29.9 billion dlrs after a 19.3 billion dlr third-quarter increase.     U.S. sales of foreign securities rose to 2.7 billion dlrs from 300 mln dlrs in the third quarter because of a sharp selloff of foreign stocks and bonds, the department said.     Outflows for U.S. direct investment abroad fell to 5.7 billion dlrs from eight billion dlrs in the third quarter.     Foreign direct investment in the United States increased 14.4 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.6 billion dlrs in the previous quarter, because of stepped-up acquisitions, the department said.     Foreign official assets in the United States increased 800 mln dlrs between October and December after rising 15.4 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     For the full year 1986, foreign official assets grew 33.4 billion dlrs after a 1985 decrease of 1.9 billion dlrs as foreign monetary authorities intervened heavily in exchange markets late in the year as the dollar fell, commerce said.  \n',bop
'The U.S. merchandise trade deficit on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said.     The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15 billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.     For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said.     During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78 billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.     The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and insurance.     The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose 1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.     Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18 pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars and a nine pct decrease from Japan.     On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.     Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were limited by drought.     Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700 mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200 mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.

Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6 billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs from 26.41 dlrs.     Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell 27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and soybeans nine pct.

'A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy.     But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct in 1986, is uncertain.     Forced last month to cut the government\'s 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out.     The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year.     France\'s economic performance, led by a mixed cast of right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed reviews from non-partisan analysts.     For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government\'s outstanding achievement has been to launch \"a veritable intellectual revolution\" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control.     \"The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad -- but set in their context of structural reforms, they are excellent,\" Develle said.     But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief architect of the government\'s free market policies, may be pursuing a mirage.     \"The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological\" said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval. \"Personally I think it\'s an illusion. Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system, from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.\"     Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard. Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks and industries to private investors.     Since December, nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas PARI.PA and glass maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA SGEP.PA, the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five-year privatisation plan.     Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since December.     At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.     The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or less.     \"But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945,\" commented Develle of Paribas.     Other achievements include a major reduction in the state\'s foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1 billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and down from 153.3 billion in 1985.     But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second since Chirac took power.     A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted.     Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology sectors, French industrial goods were \"increasingly ill-adapted to demand\" and over-priced, the report said.     French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed with the report. \"One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,\" he said.     And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment, the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7 million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.     The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.     French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last year\'s oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan, they say. ... \n',cpi
'Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of last week\'s earthquake which killed at least 300 people.

But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.     And bank economists contacted bys said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988.     \"The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,\" said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. \"We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year.\"     \"The big question is whether the government\'s policy of wage moderation will be maintained,\" he added.     The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity.     But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices.     Calling the government\'s policies \"unbalanced and unjust,\" he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training     Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of France\'s unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority.     But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.     \"Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that,\" commented Michel Develle, economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas.     Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he said.     Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.     \"But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed,\" he commented.     Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living costs.     But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.     Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long as the government kept wages under control.     Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute, INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better, he added.     Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit, several analysts said.     So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth, they said.      \n',cpi

After January\'s rise the government was forced to revise its inflation target for 1987 to 2.5 pct year on year from an initial target of two pct, after 2.1 pct in 1986.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said half the January rise was due to higher oil prices and forecast a February slowing.  \n',cpi

'The cost of living in West Germany will likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986, when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in the first recurrence of \"negative inflation\" since the 1950s, the HWWA economic research institute said.     The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986 cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.     The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the first part of 1987.     Provisional inflation figures for February released last week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct against the same month a year earlier.

'Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said both the Fed and the financial markets remain concerned about the possibility of renewed inflation.     \"A possibility of renewed inflation remains of concern, both in the markets and within the Federal Reserve,\" he said in remarks prepared for delivery to a group of business leaders here.     He said one potential channel for renewed inflationary pressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in the exchange markets, which would push import prices up sharply.     He said participants in financial markets and business remain skeptical of prospects for lasting price stability.     \"Should the skepticism about our ability to resist inflation be reinforced by bad policy, the consequences for interest rates, for exchange rates, and for the economy generally would clearly be undesirable...recognition of that danger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation of monetary policy,\" the Fed chairman said.     Volcker said attempts to drive the dollar much lower would undermine the hard won gains against inflation and would risk dissipating the flow of foreign capital.  \n',cpi

'Swiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987 and 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domestic economy, the Centre for Economic Research of the Federal Institute of Technology said in its spring review.     It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988 compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helped to keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct.     The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss economy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the more difficult international economic climate facing export industry.     The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in Swiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5 pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7 pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review.     Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the motor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986.     Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from 2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent years. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct.     The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has firmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure on Swiss exporters.     It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more modest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct.

The Statistics Office said the March increase reflected rises in certain sectors such as food, clothing and household goods and falls in transport, heating and lighting.

'Switzerland\'s economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said.     This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said.     The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.     The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year\'s sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.     But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area.     Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986.     The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years.     But \"given Switzerland\'s large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances,\" the OECD said.     Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted.     In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall GDP, it added.     The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said.     As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986.     But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange.     The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.     Particularly for the banks, \"recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position,\" it said.  \n',cpi

Energy prices rose 1.9 pct last month after a 3.0 pct rise in January, accounting for one-third of the overall CPI rise.     For the 12 months ended in February, the CPI rose an unadjusted 2.1 pct.     Transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct increase in January. Smaller price rises for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges were responsible for the moderation.     Gasoline prices rose 4.2 pct last month after increasing 6.6 pct in January, but were still 18 pct below levels of a year ago, the department said.     Housing prices rose 0.4 pct in February after a 0.5 pct January increase, largely due to a rise in fuel oil prices.     Fuel oil prices were up 4.4 pct in February after increasing 9.8 pct in January, but were still 15 pct below price levels of February 1986.     Food prices rose 0.2 pct last month after a 0.5 pct January increase.

Medical care rose 0.3 pct in February to a level 7.1 pct above one year ago, because of higher costs for prescription and non-prescription drugs and medical supplies, the department said.     The index for apparel and upkeep rose 0.7 pct in February after a 0.4 pct increase in January. The department said the introduction of higher priced spring merchandise, particularly men\'s clothing, was responsible for the advance.     Prices for other goods and services rose 0.7 pct in February following a 1.1 pct increase in January.

'Latest consumer price data indicate U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be above last year\'s pace, economists said.     \"Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time last year, but it\'s not building up a large head of steam,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.

Energy prices, which fired January\'s data with a three pct rise, advanced a more moderate 1.9 pct last month.     The CPI came within the range of economists\' expectations and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.     Among the key components of the report, transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges.     \"There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.     Economists said the latest CPI supports existing expectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.     The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986. Without last year\'s energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.     Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a result of the dollar\'s drop as well as the volatile energy component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become factored into the wider economic picture.     \"As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct inflation,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G.

'Domestic demand is now expected to make no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.     However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.     But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth.     The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.     Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated.     \"The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion,\" he said.     Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track, Keating said.     \"They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time,\" he said.     \"On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment.\"     Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.     \"Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane,\" he said.     Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand.     He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income.     The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.     \"The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88,\" Keating said.     \"As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further, and given continued effective wage restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,\" he said.  \n',gnp
'Australia\'s seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product (GDP) rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 after rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter, the Statistics Bureau said.     This compares with a 1.1 pct fall in the fourth quarter of 1985.     Compared with the year-earlier quarter, GDP also rose 1.1 pct, the Bureau figures show.     The annual rise compares with a 0.3 pct fall in the third quarter compared with the 1985 third quarter and a 4.3 pct rise in the year-earlier period, the Bureau figures show.     Real non-farm gross product rose 0.9 pct in the fourth quarter after zero growth in the third quarter and a 1.3 pct fall a year earlier, making an annual rise of 0.8 pct.     Gross farm product rose 4.3 pct compared with rises of 2.6 pct in the third quarter and 2.8 pct a year earlier, making annual growth of 6.6 pct.     Elements in the fourth quarter GDP rise included falls of 0.6 pct and 0.2 pct in private and government final consumption expenditure respectively, the Bureau figures show.     Gross fixed capital expenditure fell 0.1 pct in the quarter while exports of goods and services rose 13.0 pct and imports 2.9 pct.     Seasonally-adjusted expenditure on GDP at average 1979/80 prices rose to 36.67 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter from 36.26 billion in both the third quarter and the year-earlier quarter.     The figures are subject to revision over a long period.  \n',gnp
'A meeting of leading politicians, bankers and economists has forecast Austrian real gross domestic product growth for this year at between 0.5 and 1.5 pct, a government spokesman said.     This compared with a two pct growth forecast made by the semi-official Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) last December.     Helmut Kramer, spokesman for Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, tolds that the forecast had been made during the meeting attended by Vranitzky, Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina, National Bank President Stefan Koren and a WIFO representative.     Economists have been cutting growth forecasts recently mainly due to expectations of a poor export performance this year, notably to Eastern Europe and oil exporting states.     Hannes Androsch, general director of Creditanstalt-Bankverein CABV.VI, today put 1987 GDP growth at between one and 1.5 pct.     Kramer also said the meeting had heard that unemployment for the year would be above the 5.5 pct forecast, but was unlikely to be more than six pct.  \n',gnp
'French 1987 growth will probably be about two pct, the same as last year, due to an international environment that is less favourable than expected, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted as saying.     Treasury director Daniel Lebegue said last month that gross domestic product is expected to grow by between two and 2.5 pct this year, against an original target of 2.8 pct.     Although in line with the latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimate of 2.1 pct growth, the forecast will be balanced by growth in investments and exports, Balladur said in an interview with the daily Les Echos.     Last month Balladur said French GDP had grown by just two pct last year, compared with an initial 1986 target of 2.5 pct and 1.1 pct growth in 1985.     He told Les Echos he aims to reduce the 1988 budget deficit to 115 billion francs from this year\'s figure of 129 billion and compared with a 141 billion deficit in 1985.     He has already announced his intention of cutting the deficit to 100 billion francs in 1989.  \n',gnp
'Gross domestic product is expected to grow by 4.4 pct in the year ending June 30, Finance Minister Mohammad Syeduzzaman told reporters.     Inflation fell to an estimated 12 pct this fiscal year from 17 pct in 1981/82, he said last night.     The World Bank and other independent sources have said inflation would be around 15 pct in 1986/87.     Syeduzzaman said remittances from expatriates would rise to 600 mln dlrs this year from 425 mln in 1981/82.     Foreign exchange reserves at end-June are projected at 680 mln dlrs compared with 105 mln in 1981/82, he said.     Syeduzzaman said the export target has been set at 900 mln dlrs this year against 626 mln in 1981/82. Commitments for foreign loans and grants total more than five billion dlrs in 1986/87, against 3.54 billion five years previously, he said.     The government\'s liberal industrial policy has attracted investment commitments totalling 250 mln dlrs, he said     Foodgrain output is estimated at 16.4 mln tonnes this year, up from 16.12 mln in 1985/86 and 14.4 mln in 1981/82.     Government officials have said Bangladesh must import nearly two mln tonnes of grain annually up to 1990, when the government expects to attain self-sufficiency in food.  \n',gnp
'External risks for the economy have increased, but growth of two to 2.5 pct this year is still possible, according to President of the West German Federation of Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth.     Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the further fall of the dollar since the start of this year and the revaluation of the mark against European currencies meant West German exporters were facing a \"rough wind.\"     However, domestic demand was continuing to rise and private consumption in particular would support the economy, he said. He saw good prospects for consumer industries.     Schroeder-Hohenwarth said economic policy now had to concentrate on strengthening this domestic growth. In this context, he welcomed a decision by the government to increase the scope of tax cuts due in 1988.     He added, a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduled for 1990, which was worked out by coalition partners this month, was an \"important step in the right direction.\"     The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from 56 pct. However, Schroeder-Hohenwarth said the decision to cut the maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was \"rather half-hearted.\"  \n',gnp
'An internal report produced by the Belgian National Bank foresees the country\'s gross national product growth falling in 1987 to 1.0 pct from 2.3 pct in 1986, the independent newspaper Le Soir said.     A National Bank spokesman said the newspaper article was basically correct, but that the report was produced six weeks ago and figures were therefore to some extent out of date.     The government\'s planning bureau predicted growth of 0.9 pct this year in a study published last month.  \n',gnp
'Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987 government financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs.     He said this will enable the requirement to be held to 419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of 417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product.     Martens said following a lowering of government estimates of 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by government departments of 1987 spending, the government calculated that unless action was taken, the requirement would exceed the target by 22.5 billion francs.     Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receipts by 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion. The remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised through treasury operations.     Martens said the money is being found through a series of small economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of two billion francs through the sale of part of the government\'s 50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz.     Last year, the government announced a major program designed to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs.     The program was designed to get Belgium out of what the government said was a \"snowball effect\" under which the government constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits which were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying existing debt.     In 1986, the government financing requirement is estimated at 561 billion francs or 11.0 pct of GNP.  \n',gnp
'The Belgian government has lowered its forecast for the nominal increase in gross national product in 1987 to 3.5 pct from an originally forecast 3.9 pct, Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said in a statement to parliament.     He said this revision, which brings government forecasts more closely into line with those by private institutions, takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economy and international trade.     But he said the impact on the Belgian economy will be limited due to recent agreements on wages and working conditions agreed by employers and unions.     Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP to grow in volume terms.     However, last month the government\'s Planning Bureau said it had revised its 1987 forecast for this to 0.9 pct from 2.0 pct.     In 1986, Belgium\'s gross national product rose 2.15 pct in volume terms against a 5.9 pct nominal rise.  \n',gnp
'Bolivia is to make a formal offer during the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bank president Jier Nogales said.      Nogales tolds in an interview the steering committee of Bolivia\'s creditor banks had agreed to consider the offer at a meeting in New York last month.      He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian paper on the international secondary debt market, where it now trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value.     Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the discounted rate in full.     Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to 30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the international markets, he added.     Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans to commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said there would be no money available to restart traditional debt servicing to them for some time.      Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs, but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at discounted rates.     Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in the next few months.      He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over the price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would make a single non-negotiable offer.     He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly creditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The only traditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which would mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss provisions, he added.     \"We are confident that the banks are going to be reasonable,\" Nogales said. \"Now they can resolve their problems for once and for all.\"     \"The most conservative ones who want a little more will wait a year, but I don\'t know if the window of opportunity will be open all the time,\" he added.     Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia\'s four billion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed to governments and the rest to international agencies, Nogales said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent discussions with the Paris Club.      He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, while accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interest rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris Club rules, he added.      He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with Argentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt.     He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from international agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year.     The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs last year, he added.     Nogales said that Bolivia\'s net international reserves now stood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs in disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro took office in August, 1985.     Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct a year in the government\'s first month in office, was now down to 10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and the plan was that it should continue at this level.     He said the government was also expecting at least three pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative rates.  \n',gnp
'Brazil\'s Gross Domestic Product, GDP, rose by 8.2 pct in real terms last year following an 8.3 pct increase in 1985, the Geography and Statistics Institute said.

Agricultural output, hit by adverse weather, fell by 7.3 pct last year led by coffee production which was 46 pct down.

'Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said he expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of 1986.     \"We see moderate growth,\" Crow told a news conference following presentation of the central bank\'s annual report in the House of Commons today.     He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy, particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth quarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.     Crow reiterated the bank\'s previous statements that inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy and said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada\'s inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.     The governor said Canada\'s banking system remains sound despite recent concern about exposure by the country\'s banks in debt plagued countries such as Brazil.     \"It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but I think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact,\" Crow told reporters.  \n',gnp

'Canadian economic growth is expected to slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should keep the country from recession, economists said.     \"The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth over the course of 1987,\" said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.     Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product, grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion, but down from 1985\'s four pct.     In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter.     \"Essentially it is a flat performance,\" said Warren Jestin, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.     Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc said \"it shows the economy is not moving along very steadily, it\'s not a very promising number.\"     \"We weren\'t surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter in Canada, but we don\'t think there will be a recession,\" she added.     The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this year.     Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.     Statistics Canada also reported the country\'s trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs from the previous year\'s shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.     \"The sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,\" the federal agency said in a statement.     The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.     But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S. economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and help fuel the country\'s modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of Canada\'s exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.  \n',gnp
'Canada\'s real gross domestic product, seasonally adjusted, rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, the same as the growth as in the previous quarter, Statistics Canada said.     That left growth for the full year at 3.1 pct, which is down from 1985\'s four pct increase.     The rise was also slightly below the 3.3 pct growth rate Finance Minister Michael Wilson predicted for 1986 in February\'s budget. He also forecast GDP would rise 2.8 pct in 1987.     Statistics Canada said final domestic demand rose 0.6 pct in the final three months of the year after a 1.0 pct gain in the third quarter.     Business investment in plant and equipment rose 0.8 pct in the fourth quarter, partly reversing the cumulative drop of 5.8 pct in the two previous quarters.  \n',gnp
'Canada\'s gross domestic product rose 0.1 pct, seasonally adjusted, in January after gaining 1.0 pct in December but falling 0.1 pct and 0.3 pct in November and October, Statistics Canada said.     January\'s rise, in 1981 prices, was fueled largely by a 0.5 pct gain in the goods producing sector. Output in services-producing industries declined 0.1 pct from December\'s level.     January\'s level was 1.29 pct higher than the same month a year ago.     The federal agency said it was the second straight gain for goods producing industries. Most of the growth occurred in manufacturing and construction.     Within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood, machinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups. Significant declines were recorded in the output of automobiles and parts, however.     In the services sector, increases in finance, insurance and communication were more than offset by declines in transportation, storage and the retail trade.  \n',gnp

'Leaks of a major Dutch official economic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this year, political and market sources say.     Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness this year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage increase, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth.     But whatever the government\'s response, the central bank will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say.     The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB) publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and the economy.     Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch economic growth was now seen around one pct.     Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar, Pierson said in its February economic outlook.     The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of 2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September.     The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990.     Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder.     Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised the guilder\'s revaluation in line with the West German mark in last January\'s European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness.     But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment.     Some analysts also question the central bank\'s decision not to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge.     Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on the money market, noting \"the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already far below the market rates.\"     Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest rate policies serve that goal.     Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold to take profits.     Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.     Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.     Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first.     One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down to reduce the government debt burden.     A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between the ministry and the central bank. \"The cabinet\'s policy is steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark,\" he said.  \n',gnp
'Dutch economic growth is slowing as a firming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries reduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planning agency CPB said.     The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economic outlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected to grow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in 1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.     Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20 billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increase from last year\'s 423.95 billion.     The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value of the guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pct last year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an average of 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.     \"The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit labour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, while these are rising slightly in the Netherlands,\" the CPB said.     More of economic growth now depended on domestic consumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins set by domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on purchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.     Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, the CPB said. Inflation was zero last year.     Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five pct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last year, the CPB said.     Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to condition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent years, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of these factors on Dutch competitiveness.     In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social security costs to employers.     The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2 pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year, urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down the deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in future.     Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by falling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.     It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this year from 710,000 last year.     While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is within its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two pct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.     Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in its February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant prices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts had expected the CPB\'s final forecast to be below its own latest estimate.     \"It is too early to comment because I haven\'t seen the whole document yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some of our estimates,\" a Pierson economist said.     The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in 1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy exports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said.     Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with four pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said.     The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the surplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1 billion last year, the CPB forecast.  \n',gnp
'The Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria\'s 1987 gross domestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct forecast made last December.     WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw the one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, as the upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revision due to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.     A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil producing states, combined with the effects of the dollar\'s fall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.     Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this year. After last year\'s 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private consumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct in 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.     Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2 pct last year due to the slack economic activity.     Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit of about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion surplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria\'s central bank, last month forecast the current account would be roughly in balance this year.     However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have no notable effect on the government\'s attempts to cut the budget deficit. This year\'s aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9 pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, he said.  \n',gnp
'The Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986, private economists said.     Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand, was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year, the economists said.     They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years.     The report said Japan\'s gross national product rose a real 0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous quarter.     It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from 4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis.     They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales.     But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off.     \"Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises,\" said Shoji Saito, general manager of Mitsui Bank\'s economic research division.     He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of  falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit hard by the yen\'s rise.     Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor. Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures, he said.     Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute, said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins.     \"This is just a one-shot spending and we can\'t expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter,\" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito\'s reign.     Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending.     Saito said the most effective government action would be income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a proposed controversial sales tax.  \n',gnp
'This year will see a pickup in U.S. economic growth and inflation, the Shadow Open Market Committee said in its semi-annual policy statement.     The SOMC, a group of basically \"monetarist\" private economists, said that \"economic growth will accelerate in 1987 in response to powerful stimulative actions by the Federal Reserve.\"     The group said the Fed\'s actions have been excessive. As a result, it said that \"inflation and ultimately another recession now loom on the horizon.\"     The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on progressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead to sustainable economic growth and stable prices.     The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or inflation growth in its policy statement. However, the Committee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it was basically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is a member of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.     Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage point higher than in the past two years. He expects consumer prices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year.     The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been a principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costly inflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to \"abandon its inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary base on the path toward sustained lower inflation.\"     The Fed in February said it would no longer target the narrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 and economic growth has been largely severed.  \n',gnp
'Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the world and said that progress was being made.     \"It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve\'s promotion of price stability is critical to the successful implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients for growth,\" he told the Eastern Economic Association.     Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of fronts. \"Federal Reserve monetary policy, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and the Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the right direction,\" he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain, France, Japan, West Germany and Canada.     On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment toward slowing the growth of federal spending.     There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National Product were declining and would continue to drop, he said.     But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep interest rates stable.     \"This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely. Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive federal spending,\" he said.     A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the main objective of the Fed, Johnson said.     He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of exchange rates was needed for long-term growth.     On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against \"quick fix\" solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation or protectionist trade legislation.     \"What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine economic growth,\" he said.     Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow for its gradual resolution over time.  \n',gnp
'Finland\'s gross national product is expected to rise by three pct in 1987 against two pct in 1986 and inflation will be unchanged at about 3.5 pct, the private business survey office ETLA predicted.     Unemployment in 1987 is put at 5.5 pct, in line with last year, the office predicted in its regular review.     The balance of payments would show a five billion markka deficit in 1987, against a 4.2 billion deficit in 1986.  \n',gnp
'French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9 pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.     The report said the French economy was \"increasingly ill-adapted to demand\" selling goods at \"uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets.\"     \"France\'s poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months,\" it said.     Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986, it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to \"a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries.\"     This could result in further major losses of market share, particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports, it said.     Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the authorities would have \"little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly,\" it added.     But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.     Written mainly in December last year, the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the government\'s deregulation of service sector tariffs.     \"We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost,\" one OECD official commented.     OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct.     The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year\'s 2.1 pct.     But the OECD backed the government\'s view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year, with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year\'s fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation.     With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said.     On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits.     \"For the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,\" it said.  \n',gnp
'France\'s Economic and Social Council (CES), an advisory body comprising industrialists, trade unionists and representatives of other sectors of the French economy, said the country\'s annual growth may not reach two pct in 1987.     French gross domestic product risks not reaching the two pct growth registered last year, the Council said in a report on first quarter 1987 economic activity without giving any specific forecasts. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted today as saying that French 1987 growth will probably be about two pct.     Balladur said in an interview with the financial daily Les Echos that the country\'s economic growth will probably be about the same as last year due to a less favourable international environment.     CES President Philippe Neeser said one of the major fears for the French economy this year was a resurge in inflation.     Disinflation was an absolute priority, Neeser told journalists, adding that a failure to do this would be extremely serious as if would be very difficult to reverse for many years.  \n',gnp
'French gross domestic product should grow by 2.3 pct in 1988 after two pct growth this year and 2.1 pct in 1986, the Finance Ministry said.     The latest forecast, prepared by the National Accounts and Budget Commission, assumed an exchange rate of 6.20 francs to the dollar this year and next and an average oil import price rising to 18.9 dlrs a barrel next year from 17.4 dlrs this year and 14.7 in 1986.     The Commission, headed by Finance minister Edouard Balladur, forecast a fall in consumer price inflation to two pct year-on-year at end-1988 from 2.4 pct at end 1987 and 2.1 pct last year.     In annual average terms inflation would fall to two pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year and 2.7 pct last year, it said.     Trade should show a one billion franc annual surplus this year and next after last year\'s 0.5 billion surplus, it added.     Employment should rise by 0.1 pct a year over the next two years while the state budget deficit should be cut to 2.2 pct of GDP in 1988 from 2.6 pct this year and 2.9 pct in 1986.     Other forecasts prepared by the Commission indicated a 1.8 pct 1988 rise in household purchasing power, up from 1.1 pct this year but less than last year\'s 2.9 pct, and a 1.6 pct rise in household consumption, compared with this year\'s 1.5 pct and last year\'s 2.9 pct.     Business investment is forecast to rise four pct a year this year and next after 3.7 pct last year, with private sector productive investment rising 4.9 pct in 1988 after a six pct rise this year and 5.5 pct in 1986.     The Ministry said updated forecasts would be prepared before the autumn to serve as the basis for the 1988 budget, which the government is now preparing for presentation in September.  \n',gnp
'French gross domestic product will grow by only 1.5 pct in real terms this year, compared with the government\'s forecast of two to 2.5 pct growth, the private Institut des Previsions Economiques et Financieres pour le Developpement des Entreprises (IPECODE) said.     However, it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986 level of two pct.     IPECODE said demand and production would develop in parallel this year, in contrast to last year when production was unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domestic demand, unleashing higher import demand.     Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298 mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals in francs by member nations, and an increase in reserves of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment of French debts.     Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM) remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs.     French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct last year, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pct in 1988, it added.     Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4.3 pct this year and 5.5 pct in 1988, down from 6.5 pct in 1986.     Inflation, which was running at 2.1 pct at the end of 1986, is likely to rise to 2.9 pct at the end of this year, IPECODE said, while the government has forecast 2.5 pct.     However, the institute said inflation would fall back to 2.5 pct at the end of 1988, \"provided that real wage costs remain within the framework of productivity rises.\"  \n',gnp
'Senior officials in the West German coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month\'s international monetary conference in Paris.     Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion mark reduction would represent net tax relief.     An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.     The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.     Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal increase in income tax.     An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers 1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and medium-sized companies.     The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would be introduced next year, ahead of schedule.     The West German government had come under pressure from the United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of growth was uncertain.     The government said in January it was aiming for real growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some economists have revised their predictions down to two or below.     Stoltenberg said: \"We remain on a course of expansion. Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe, or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few days ago, remains open at the moment.\"  \n',gnp
'The economy will grow by an average rate of 2.2 pct a year in real terms between now and the end of 1991, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB) said in an annual report.     A year ago WestLB had forecast average growth of just under three pct for 1986-1990.     The 1987 report said gross national product would only expand a real 1.7 pct this year -- below previous expectations -- because of weaker exports. Growth rates will pick up later, however, producing a 2.2 pct increase on average for the five-year period.  MORE \n',gnp
'Uncertainty is growing about the prospects for the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scale back investment plans, the German Savings Banks and Giro Association said.     Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, while industry is less optimistic than it was, the association said in a report.     However, last month\'s agreement among the six leading western industrialized countries to keep currencies around present levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence for exporters, it added.     The banking association said the possibility of using monetary policy to stimulate the economy should not be overestimated.     Another small drop in already low interest rates could not be expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of consumer or capital goods, it said.     The Bundesbank\'s half-point cuts in the discount and Lombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope for any further monetary moves, the association added.     On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said gross national product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar adjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the third quarter.     The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNP in the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively weak.     Bank economists have forecast the economy will either stagnate or contract slightly in the first quarter. Official first-quarter figures are due in early June.  \n',gnp
'The outlook for the West German economy is relatively bright, with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel University\'s Institute for World Economy said.     The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.     In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany\'s export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark\'s strength against the dollar and other major currencies.     \"The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in all, limited,\" the report said. \"On the contrary, a slight rise in exports can be expected.\"     The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges.     They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year.     West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy, the institute said.     However, it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours.     The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation.     It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession. It said central banks in industrialized countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal Reserve Board\'s expansionary course.     The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S. Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world.     Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home.     The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct.  \n',gnp
'The DIW economic research institute said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.     The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the other four leading German institutes, said the economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.     The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter of last year.              \n',gnp
'Extracts from a report by Italy\'s Budget Ministry on the country\'s economic development in 1986 showed gross domestic product (GDP) 2.7 pct higher in real terms than in 1985 but a rise in unemployment.     GDP calculated at 1980 prices rose to 434,682 billion lire last year from 423,064 billion in 1985. On a current prices basis, GDP was up 11 pct, totalling 894,362 billion lire in 1986 against 805,754 billion in 1985.      But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise in unemployment to 11.1 pct last year from 10.3 pct in 1985, the ministry said.     The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of the dollar during 1986 had favoured oil-importing countries such as Italy.     These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 6.3 pct in 1986, down from 9.3 pct in 1985.     They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance.     On the basis of data recently recalculated by the national statistics institute Istat, Italy had a trade deficit in 1986 of 3,722 billion lire, the report said. This slightly revises a previous deficit figure of 3,717 billion issued by Istat and compares with a negative balance of 23,085 billion for 1985.  \n',gnp
'Italy\'s gross domestic product (GDP) will grow three pct in real terms this year and 2.7 pct in 1988, said economic information company Data Resources Europe Inc (DRI).     Michel Girardin, DRI Europe\'s senior economist, said at a conference that Italian GDP growth this year \"will be mainly driven by consumption and especially investment.\"     Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next year will shift from domestic demand to exports as a result of expected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies.     Italy\'s budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7 pct in real terms in 1986.     DRI forecast that inflation, which was an average 6.3 pct in 1986, will be under five pct this year and that interest rates should drop two pct.     Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct against the dollar this year following last year\'s 22 pct appreciation. An expected German mark appreciation against the dollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of its value relative to the German currency, he said.     DRI estimates that foreign demand for Italian products should grow by a 3.2 pct this year following last year\'s 6.2 pct increase.  \n',gnp
'The worst may be just about over for Japan\'s battered economy but economists said they do not expect a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists polled bys said the economy\'s 18 month-old slowdown is likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. \"The economy will bottom out in the middle of the year,\" said Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido.     Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi agreed. \"It (the bottom) is in the offing,\" he said.     But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct, from two pct in the current year, he said.     Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst are increasing.     The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward the end of last year.     Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks, several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery.     Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3 pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey released last week showed that the decline in Japanese corporate earnings may be nearing its end.     And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said.     Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels.     The yen\'s 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market.     \"The important thing is the exchange rate,\" Taketomi said.     If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs of that yet, economists said.     A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to recover, economists said.     Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some loosening of the government\'s tight fiscal policy said Haruo Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.     The next reading of the economy\'s health should come early next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter, 1986.     Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.     But a senior government official said the fourth quarter figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.     To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.      The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of 1986, the official said.     Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also distorted by the government\'s sale of gold coins in the second half of 1986.     Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year bonuses, they said.     As the government had to buy back some of the coins from retailers because they were unsold, the government\'s contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been boosted, economists said.     Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last year was good.     The senior government official said the fourth quarter performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than generally expected, while that of the external sector was better.  \n',gnp

'Japan\'s leading economic organisations urged the Government to prepare drastic pump-priming measures even at the cost of shelving Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s planned tax reforms, officials involved said.     Officials of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) said in a meeting with government officials the Government should issue construction bonds as an emergency measure to prop up the economy.     Keidanren suggested that proceeds from sales of stocks in the newly-privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp should also be used to stimulate the economy.     Keidanren Chairman Eishiro Saito said the dollar\'s fall below 150 yen would create huge unemployment and bankruptcies that could shake the foundation of the Japanese economy.     The Keidanren meeting coincided with a written request for drastic reflationary measures sent to the Government by the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.     Both organisations called for stepped-up Bank of Japan intervention to stabilise exchange rates.     Chamber head Noboru Gotoh told a press conference the awaited economic package should be powerful enough to push up Japan\'s Gross National Product (GNP) by about two pct.     Gotoh said the Government could cope with the present critical economic condition even if it put off its plan to stop the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.     The plan to reduce the fiscal budget is a pillar of Nakasone\'s fiscal reconstruction program.   \n',gnp
'Kenya\'s economy will continue to expand this year and the government will do more to encourage investment by foreign firms and the local private sector, Planning Minister Robert Ouko said.     He told a news conference that the government would soon create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment applications by local and foreign investors.     Praising the role of multinational companies and local entrepreneurs in Kenya\'s economy, the minister promised to maintain a close working contact with the private sector.     The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in 1985, Ouko said. This was owing to high prices for the country\'s coffee exports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes, he added.     \"Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices, Kenya\'s economy is still expected to improve in 1987,\" the planning minister said.     Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises announced in February, the minister added.     Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the long rainy season, which is due to start about now.     Ouko said the production of Kenya\'s main cash crops increased during the second half of last year.

It said in its latest quarterly review that real gross domestic product averaged an annual growth of 1.1 pct over the first nine months of last year compared with a decline of 0.1 pct in the corresponding period in 1985.     Growth was generated mainly by the manufacturing sector, it added.  \n',gnp
'The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd (DBS) said Malaysia\'s real gross domestic product growth (gdp) in 1987 could be 1.5 to two pct, above a budget target of one pct.     It said in a report that because of an economic recovery and higher foreign exchange reserves, the Malaysian ringgit is unlikely to face devaluation in the near future.     The report was presented at a two-day investment conference organised by the DBS, one of Singapore\'s four major banks.     The report said rising commodity prices and the continued expansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorous fiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds for cautious optimism about the Malaysian economy.     It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60 and 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of the year.     But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia\'s external debt remains worrying and should be controlled. It said Malaysia\'s external debt totals 48 to 49 billion Malaysian dlrs and its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct.  \n',gnp
'Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 1987 is expected to grow by between 1.5 and two pct, up from one pct in 1986, the central bank said.     The forecast compares with the one pct GDP growth forecast made by the Treasury last October.     Bank Negara also said in its annual report that gross national product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct, after declining 7.3 pct in 1986.     It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since last November had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil and commodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports.     Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipated rise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustain their average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added.     Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil will average 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palm oil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a rise of 12 pct in manufacturing exports.     It said Malaysia\'s international terms of trade will turn around to rise by two pct in 1987 after declining 12 pct in 1986 and five pct in 1985.     \"In 1987, income will be higher, private consumer spending is likely to recover and expand... The budget will remain under strict control... The resource gap in the government\'s finances on current account will be bridged over the near term,\" Bank Governor Jaafar Hussein said in the report.     The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1.19 billion ringgit in 1986 or 1.8 pct of GNP from 1.79 billion or 2.5 pct of the GNP the previous year.     The bank forecasts the inflation rate will increase by 1.5 pct, after its 0.7 pct rise in 1986.  \n',gnp
'The U.S. economy in March improved at a faster rate than in February, with the National Association of Purchasing Management\'s composite index rising to 53.9 pct from 51.9 pct, the NAPM said.     The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct. The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national product growth of about three pct.     An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy.     The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all of the indicators in the index except inventories, which declined slightly.     New orders rose sharply in March, with production also higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since August 1984.     Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM\'s business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc PBI said \"the economy ended the first quarter with a healthy, if not substantial improvement.\"     Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in March assures a good beginning for the second quarter.     Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at 2.5 pct.     The estimated average price increase anticipated by members for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as being significant.     The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.     The monthly report is based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies.  \n',gnp
'European Community finance ministers discussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too pessimistic.     The Commission, the EC\'s executive authority, two weeks ago cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3 per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn.     It said economic prospects had been less promising over the past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the dollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which would restrain Community exports.     But diplomats said several member states, led by West Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy, especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise currencies around current levels.     \"Many delegations feel the (Commission\'s) report is rather too pessimistic,\" said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired the meeting.     The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for West Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear it feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe.     But two top German officials, State Secretaries Otto Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need at the moment for action to bolster the EC\'s biggest economy.     The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France, while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commission\'s view that Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth. \n',gnp
'There is no question of stimulating consumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other reflationary policies to boost the French economy, sources close to finance minister Edouard Balladur said.     Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques Chirac\'s spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministers were agreed on the desirability of \"relaunching\" the economy.     This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a reflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruled out any such move.     The sources today said the government\'s policy remained one of \"recovery,\" or sound finances and greater efficiency.     They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion franc revenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation program will go to providing public companies with fresh capital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go toward paying off national debt.     Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30 billion would be distributed between repayment of national internal debt and public companies in similar proportions, they added.     The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when the country\'s internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct this year from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as fast as gross domestic product.     Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this year from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line with earlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.     The sources said that with France\'s economic targets for 1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, the government had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at an artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies.  \n',gnp
'Australia faces a major medium term adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest annual review of the Australian economy.     It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4 pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external debt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD countries.     A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth and external competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall had sharply deteriorated since June 1985.     A major shift of real resources to the external sector -- about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to grow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said.     Success depended on the setting of right policies including tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour.     Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in trade volumes.     It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored, the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of GDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by mid-1988.     Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain the competitive edge created by the Australian dollar\'s depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in order to encourage business investment.     The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing industries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to correct its external imbalances.     It added Australia should reduce protection levels in manufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would no doubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry.  \n',gnp
'President Alan Garcia said he sought to deepen Peru\'s hard-line foreign debt stance, possibly by limiting repayments to the World Bank.     In a televised address tonight, he criticised the World Bank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amount the bank is willing to make in new loans. \"We will deepen our policy on the foreign debt,\" he said.     Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of export earnings, effectively suspending most remittances due foreign private banks and many governments. It has generally been current for most of Garcia\'s 20 months in office on payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.     But tonight Garcia said: \"We have met our aim of limiting the payment of the debt and will limit it also even though organisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us to buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types of public works and not others, and to pay much more in dollars than that which they are willing to newly lend us.\"     The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank about 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country\'s 14 billion dlr debt.     Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin America because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic product (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line on debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year.     He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage to 1,260 intis per month, benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage workers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln.     Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants and 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but not covered by collective bargaining agreements.     He also said the price of petrol, frozen since August 1, 1985, would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis per U.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of the year. He did not say when this increase would be effective.     Taxes on petrol are the government\'s leading revenue earner, traditionally accounting for about one-third of taxes. Sales taxes on autos, liquour and cigarettes would also go up, he said, without specifying the amount.     Garcia announced the government would encourage Peruvians to repatriate their savings deposited abroad by paying a 15 pct premium above the market exchange rate.     The inti\'s official buy-sell rate against the dollar is 14.85/92 and the free rate is about 21.70/80.     To encourage private investment, he said the government would set up a special fund with which it would match every two intis of private investment with one inti from the government.     He also said his dismissal of Peruvian Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Luis Abram Cavarellino yesterday strengthened the democratic authority of his government.  \n',gnp
'Portugal\'s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow around four pct this year, the same rate as in 1986, according to a Bank of Portugal forecast.     Total investment this year, the country\'s second as a member of the European Community (EC), will rise nearly 10 pct, again the same rate as last year, the central bank study said.     It added that Portugal\'s current account was forecast to show a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13 billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year.     Last year\'s high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil and raw materials, lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar.     Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this year and exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and 6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said.     The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that the non-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the current government would be maintained, particularly in budget spending and income and in wage policy.     The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based on the assumption that the international economic situation and Portugal\'s world trade relations would remain more or less the same as in 1986.     The central bank said the high rate of investment estimated for 1986 was due to government policies and to increasing optimism among firms whose financial situation had improved since 1985. This tendency was expected to continue this year, especially in the construction and public works sectors.     Financial aid from the EC had also helped to boost investment last year, the bank said.  \n',gnp
'President Reagan said the 1.1 pct U.S. economic growth rate during the final quarter of 1986 \"wasn\'t all that bad.\"     The Commerce Department said the rate of growth of the Gross National Product in the October-December period was only slightly less than a preliminary estimate of 1.3 pct made earlier.     At the same time, it said inflation, as measured by the GNP price deflator, rose by 0.7 pct during the period.     Asked his reaction to the GNP report during a White House photo session, Reagan replied, \"It wasn\'t all that bad.\"  \n',gnp
'Singapore\'s gross domestic product will grow six pct in the first quarter and five pct in the second quarter this year, with further growth expected in the second half, Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong told parliament.     The figures compared with 3.4 pct contraction and 1.2 pct growth respectively for the first and second quarters of 1986.     The estimates were based on a tentative leading indicator incorporating new business orders, company inventories and share prices used by his ministry, Lee said, without giving further details of the new indicator.     Singapore\'s economy grew 1.9 pct last year, after shrinking 1.8 pct in 1985. The government has forecast growth rate of three to four pct for 1987.  \n',gnp
'The South African Reserve Bank, confirming previous estimates, said real gross domestic product in the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.7 pct versus 4.6 pct in the third quarter and 1.3 pct in the 1985 final quarter.     The bank, in its latest quarterly review, said the nominal growth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a 1.5 pct contraction in 1985.     But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade is taken into account, the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 1.5 pct compared with a decrease of 0.5 pct in 1985.     GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by an economy but omits income from abroad.  GNP includes such payments or outflows.     The bank also said there were indications the country\'s economic recovery was becoming more broadly based.     With the exception of commerce all major sectors of the economy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domestic production.     The bank said major increases in foreign reserves were recorded in January, February and the first half of March 1987. Reserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February.     Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70 billion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the total annual value of import payments.     The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion rand in 1986 versus 5.90 mln the previous year.     The bank said continuing strength of the current account has allowed foreign reserves to be \"rebuilt to more comfortable levels.\"     \"This has strengthened the authorities\' hands in lending support to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were to be called for,\" the bank said.  \n',gnp
'South Korea plans to increase the size of its budget in 1988 by 11 to 12 pct from this year\'s 15,596 billion won, Economic Planning Board officials said.     The proposed boost is based on a government forecast that gross national product (gnp) will grow by more than 7.5 pct and the gnp deflator by 3.5 pct in 1988, against targets of 8.0 pct and 3.5 pct respectively this year, they said.     Details of the 1988 budget, in which spending will match revenue, have yet to be worked out, the officials said.     The balanced budget in 1986 totalled 13,800.5 billion won.  \n',gnp
'South Korea\'s gross national product (gnp) is forecast to grow by nine pct in 1987, surpassing the government\'s original forecast of eight pct and against a 12.5 pct rise in 1986, an Economic Planning Board report said.     The report reviewing the country\'s economy in the first three months of this year said year-on-year gnp was provisionally estimated to have grown by about 12 pct in the period, against a 10.5 pct growth in the same 1986 period.     Board officials said the gnp rise in the January-March period is due largely to increased exports, which totalled 9.34 billion dlrs against 6.9 billion a year earlier.  \n',gnp
'Spain has revised some of its main economic targets for 1987 after studying the performance of the economy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in its monthly bulletin.     Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against a previous target of 3.5 pct.     Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the central bank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing at an annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to four pct if the government were to meet its five pct inflation target this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.     The forecast for private consumption growth remains unchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revised upwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.     Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected to increase by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.     Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from 5.2 pct due to the peseta\'s continuing strength against the dollar and slack external demand.     Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spending has lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from an earlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.     The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast to five pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga\'s doubts last week on whether this target could be maintained if wage settlements continue to rise above the government\'s recommended five pct ceiling.     Unions and employers dispute the average wage increases agreed so far this year. Trade unions calculate wage settlements have produced average rises of 7.3 pct against 5.5 pct estimated by the employers\' federation CEOE.  \n',gnp
'Sweden\'s Gross National Product rose 1.3 pct last year against 2.3 pct in 1985, mainly due to a lower than forecast growth in exports and a sharp fall in total investments, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported.

Total investments fell 0.7 pct against a rise of 6.3 pct in 1985. The Finance Ministry had forecast a rise of 0.3 pct in 1986.

'Turkey\'s Gross National Product grew an estimated 8.0 pct in 1986 at fixed 1968 prices, compared with 5.1 pct in 1985, the State Statistics Institute said.     Reporting full-year data, it also said Gross Domestic Product rose 8.3 pct compared with 5.1 pct in 1985. An earlier estimate from nine-month data put full-year GNP and GDP growth both at 7.9 pct.     The government\'s GNP growth target for 1987 is five pct, the same level it had set for 1986.     The institute estimated per capita GNP for 1986 at 1,116.6 dlrs, up from 1,045.3 dlrs in 1985.     Officials blame the high 1986 GNP growth on a surge in domestic demand stemming partly from poorly controlled municipal expenditures in the early part of the year.     Industry grew at 11.1 pct in real terms in 1986 compared with 6.6 pct in 1985 while agriculture expanded 7.4 pct compared with 2.8 pct.  \n',gnp
'Britain\'s gross domestic product (GDP) on the average basis of output, expenditure and income rose by 2.6 pct in 1986 after a 3.4 pct increase a year earlier, Central Statistical Office (CSO) preliminary figures show.     In the fourth quarter, GDP rose 0.7 pct over the previous quarter and was up 3.3 pct on the same 1985 quarter.     The average estimate index, seasonally-adjusted and based 1980, was set at 114.3 in the fourth quarter of 1986 against 113.5 in the previous quarter and 110.7 in the final quarter of 1985.     The CSO said the average GDP estimate index for 1986 as a whole was 113.1, up 2.6 pct from 110.2 for 1985.     On the output measure, GDP rose an upward revised seasonally adjusted 0.3 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 to 114.9 on the output index from 114.5 in the previous quarter, giving a 3.2 pct rise over the fourth 1985 quarter, the CSO figures show.     On income-based GDP, the index in the fourth quarter rose by 0.7 pct from the third quarter and was up 3.8 pct on the year-ago quarter.     The indices stood at 115.3, 114.4 and 111.0 respectively.     Expenditure-based GDP rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from the third quarter and was up 2.9 pct from the same 1985 quarter.     The CSO set the expenditure index at 112.9 from 111.6 in the third quarter of 1986 and 109.8 in the final 1985 quarter.     The year-on-year rise for expenditure GDP was 2.3 pct with the expenditure index for the whole of 1986 set at 111.9 against 109.4 a year earlier.     For income GDP, the year-on-year rise was 2.6 pct against against three pct a year earlier. The ouptut GDP measure rose 2.8 pct year-on-year, down from 3.8 pct in 1985.     The government usually considers the output measure the most reliable way of measuring short-term GDP changes.     It is based on output data for production industry and partial information for the rest of the economy.     The government had forecast that average measure GDP would rise 2.5 pct in calendar 1986 after 3.3 pct in 1985. The budget unveiled on Tuesday foresaw GDP growth in 1987 of three pct.     The GDP deflator, based on expenditure at market prices, rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter from the third, to give a 2.4 pct rise over fourth quarter 1985. Year-on-year, the deflator rose 3.7 pct.  \n',gnp
'Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987.     He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986.     Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this year, Lawson said.     \"As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year,\" he added.     Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0 billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP.     The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg.     On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987/88.     No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate, he said. \"But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course will the exchange rate,\" the Chancellor told Parliament.     Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 \"is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular.\"     On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987.     He said \"it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the public finances in a very strong position.\"     Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future.     \"We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term Financial Strategy\'s) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0 pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead,\" Lawson said.     \"Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course remains a major objective of government policy.\"     \"But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.\"     Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book.     On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies\' capital gains will be charged at the \"appropriate corporation tax rate.\"     He said that under the new proposed system, companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments against tax on capital gains.     \"Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988/89,\" Lawson said.     Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax, \"with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.\"     \"I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and File.\"     This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection, and would not come into force until the early 1990s.     Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their (PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred.     Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field.     On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers.     Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received.     Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21,300 stg.     New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added.     The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125,000 stg.     Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment. The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but \"genuine trading companies\" will not be affected.     He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans, also from April 1.     \"In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,\" he said.     The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct.     Lawson reiterated the government\'s aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added \"given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.\"     Small companies\' corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct, he said.     On the Lloyd\'s insurance market, Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd\'s syndicates, bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders.

'Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987.     He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by the summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year.     The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87, Lawson said.     Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as the exchange rate.     The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to the buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular.     On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future, he said.  \n',gnp
'Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said a 0.7 pct rise in February\'s index of leading indicators pointed to stronger economic growth in the first half of 1987.     In a statement commenting on the rise last month after a 0.5 pct January decline, Baldrige noted the leading index was rising at an 8.0 pct annual rate in the six months to the end of February.     \"Based on past relationships, that gain is consistent with stepped up growth in real GNP during the first half of 1987,\" Baldrige said.  \n',gnp
'Senior U.S. Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets.     Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration\'s opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth.     By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.     Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments.     He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely.     Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988.     Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks pretty good to me. We\'ve had two very strong employment reports.\"     He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding, \"It looks like they\'re on track.\"     While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit, Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.     The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives, he said.     \"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform,\" Sprinkel said. \"In 1986, this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family.\"     Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit.     In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.     Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.     \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years,\" Sprinkel said.     \"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,\" he added.     However, the Congressional Budget Office\'s Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.     \"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit) are unpleasant,\" he said.     Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the \"biggest sustained inflation in our nation\'s history,\" which helped foster widespread distrust of government.     \"The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level,\" Penner said.     \"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot.\"     Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.     He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed.     \"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there\'s no ... Way to enforce it,\" Penner said.     Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets.     \"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved more than two billion dlrs,\" Penner said.  \n',gnp
'The U.S. Gross National Product, after removing the impact of inflation, increased at a revised annual rate of 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said.     That was down from an earlier preliminary 1.3 pct rise estimated a month ago and down from the 2.1 pct rise in the fourth quarter of 1985.     The final fourth quarter revision, however, left unchanged the previous estimate of a 2.5 pct increase in GNP for all of 1986 over 1985.     The revised estimate for fourth quarter GNP partly reflected a downward revision in inventories to a total decrease of 28.5 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, the department said.     The revisions also indicated personal consumption spending decreased 2.2 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter after an increase of 39.6 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     Exports of goods and services rose 15.3 billion dlrs after a decline of 9.4 billion dlrs in the third quarter. Imports decreased 700 mln dlrs in the final quarter, in contrast to an increase of 20.9 billion dlrs in the third quarter.  \n',gnp
'president jaime lusinchi defended the 20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling accord his government recently signed, saying it will open new credit flows and bring needed foreign investment to venezuela.     In his annual state of the nation speech, lusinchi also said venezuela supports other latin american debtors, despite having reached a rescheduling accord on its own.     In the 90-minute speech to the congress, lusinchi summed up the achievements of his administration, which took office in february 1984. He pointed to the 3.3 pct growth in non-oil gdp in 1986 and to a \"moderate\" 12 pct inflation rate.     Lusinchi said the 20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling signed feb. 27 put an end to a process which had been \'the calvary of our nation over the post four years.\'     In the refinancing accord, he said, venezuela managed to achieve \'the most inmportant thing, which is the reopening of financial flows from abroad, essential for the financing of development and the (financing) of trade and investment.\'     Once all the details of the agreement are finalized, he said, venezuela will seek new financing for the imported components of new development projects.     \"our intention is not to continue being net exporters of capital, but to protect our balance of payments with a flow of capital towards venezuela,\" he said.     Under the agreement signed february 27, venezuela extended payments on the debt from 12 to 14 years, while the interest rate was lowered from 1 y 1/8 to 7/8 of a pct over libor.     At the same time, payments over the next three years were lowered from 3.450 to 1.350 billion dlrs.     Lusinchi defended the rescheduling accord against critics who said it merely deferred the weight of payments to future governments.  \n',gnp
'A confidential World Bank report on the Peruvian economy has said the government\'s strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure.     The report, published today by the economic monthly, The Peru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcia\'s government in stimulating output last year to achieve a growth in gross domestic product of over eight pct \"represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long.\"     Government officials had no immediate comment on the report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment program and greater emphasis on the preservation of Peru\'s export potential.     The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation program was encountering rising difficulties.     \"An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls, appears not improbable,\" it added.     The world bank report said the government\'s policies had reduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption at the apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of the currency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses, and sharply diminished creditworthiness.     It said unless the government took action quickly to fix a competitive exchange rate and control the public sector deficit, \"the higher the probability will be that the government will eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment of domestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still further controls on imports in order to stem inflation and support the balance of payments.\"     It said the bank would place more emphasis on the preservation of peru\'s export potential, external links and overall economic efficiency.     The government\'s incentive policies towards the mining and petroleum sectors, among its main traditional exports, suggested that it did not accord high priority to their economic viability, it added.  \n',gnp
'Zimbabwe\'s real gross domestic product increased 0.2 pct in 1986, according to preliminary figures published by the Central Statistical Office (CSO). This contrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985.     The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth was a drop in the real value of agricultural output. This declined 12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previous year. Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturing production increased 1.4 pct.     The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 12.7 pct to 8.2 billion Zimbabwe dlrs, but inflation, measured by the GDP deflator, was estimated at 12.2 pct, so there was virtually no growth in real output during 1986.  \n',gnp

'Momentum in th U.S. economy may be picking up given solid across-the board increases in the February U.S. employment report, economists said.     U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February, twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a 319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 448,000 increase.     \"Even if you look at January and February together, this is still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in the market,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.     Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much larger gains in February U.S. production and income than previously forecast.     The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from 34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose 0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since November 1966, the Commerce Department said.     \"The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7 pct,\" said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4 pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.     Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour in February from 8.83 dlrs in January.     \"Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means we\'ll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis the wage and salary disbursement,\" he said.     Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.     He said the February employment gains are consistent with his firm\'s first quarter U.S. real gross national product growth forecast of 3.7 pct.     Economists agreed that the employment data were negative for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy and no easing in the Federal Reserve\'s monetary policy. But most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.     \"This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider easing,\" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.     \"It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,\" he said. \"If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so, but it\'s most likely they\'ll sit and wait.\"     \"The data have not been uniform,\" Stone added. \"Durable goods were weak in January and now employment is strong.\"     In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct, followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S. retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap widened to 14.8 billion dlrs.     \"Things just aren\'t adding up,\" said Steve Slifer of Lehman Goverment Securities Inc. \"Consumer spending, capital spending, goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first quarter GNP growth of one pct,\" he said.     \"The employment and production data point to a big inventory build-up, but that\'s what we thought in the fourth quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.\"     Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000 in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery industries returning to work.     Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains have resulted from an improving trade outlook.     Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S. trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve in the first quarter.     \"Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter, but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show that trade is improving,\" Benderley said.     \"The economy is moving between extremes,\" he said. \"Some reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.\"     A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater part of February\'s employment gain. Retail services employment rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in January, previously reported at 166,000.     Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 142,000 gain.     The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at 6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since March 1980, the Commerce Department noted.     \"The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,\" Carson said. \"This takes away the Fed\'s flexibility to ease, but there\'s no reason to tighten.

'The government announced a three billion franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation among political and economic analysts that it is positioning itself for a period of economic reflation.     The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe Seguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc contingency fund announced on February 25.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a reflationary program.     Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third of French unemployed, government figures show.     The main measures of the employment program give employers financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term unemployed return to the labour market.     Training subsidies and exemptions from social security contributions are the main incentives for employers.     \"Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour market and that\'s why the proposals...Are costly,\" an aide to Seguin said.     The analysts said speculation the government is considering a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.     He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out economic stimulation despite the government\'s revision of its 1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.     Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin\'s remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate the economy through a boost to consumer spending although government policy allowed for increased industrial investment from the proceeds of France\'s five-year privatisation plan.     The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt and providing state enterprises with fresh capital.     Some political analysts said Baudouin\'s comments possibly reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on social issues ahead of next year\'s presidential elections.      Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with labour.      Officials said that after the success of the privatisation of Cie de Saint Gobain SGEP.PA and Cie Financiere de Paribas PARI.PA the government had decided to speed up its five-year privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in 1988.     The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted revenue to boost industrial and research investment and spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway network.    The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by improving the competitiveness of French industry.     The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of State.  \n',jobs

December\'s 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government\'s Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953.     \"There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment,\" said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.     The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions.     \"At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving,\" a Labour Ministry official said.     Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.     Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.     The yen\'s surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said.     Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd\'s economics department.     However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years.  \n',jobs

According to the revised data there were 94,000 jobless in February representing 2.2 pct of the workforce against 120,000 or 2.8 pct of the workforce in February 1986.     SCB official Olle Wessberg said the new figures were based on a more extensive survey of the unemployed which brought Sweden into line with the practises recommended by the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation.     Wessberg said the new method cut the number of unemployed by about 16 pct. \"The way we are now collecting data is far more accurate and we are asking many more questions to find out whether the jobless want work, whether they are able to work and whether they have actually looked for work,\" he tolds.     The new method was first used for the January figures, which showed unemployment dropping to 2.1 pct of the workforce from 2.7 pct (old style) in December, but Wessberg said the change had apparently not been noticed by the press.     Recalculated according to the new method, unemployment in February 1986 would have stood at 2.2 pct, the SCB said.  \n',jobs

'Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said the central bank was worried that money supply was growing too fast, reflecting excessive internal demand in the Spanish economy, but added that he was confident recent measures would succeed in restricting money growth.

The bank\'s target range for growth in this measure in 1987 is 6.5 to 9.5 pct, compared with 11.4 pct last year.     Rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range.     He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was due to a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pct real drop in the contribution of the external sector.     The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but a drop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negative component of the external sector trimmed to 1.5 pct, he said.  \n',money-supply

'Bundesbank council member Lothar Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates.     Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy.     The article followed international press speculation that the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy.     Mueller, a member of the Bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria, noted that the Bundesbank\'s decision in January to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting.     \"Simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy,\" he explained.     Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation. The Bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down.     Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials, also encouraged investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller said.     The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path, he said.     \"Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this quiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months,\" he added.     \"All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite suppositions to the contrary,\" Mueller said.     \"Keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates, especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than growth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non-banks,\" Mueller said.     Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy.     Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate.     In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S. Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said.     But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank.     Even interest rates are not in the centre of the Bundesbank\'s considerations, but reflect competition and other market conditions, Mueller said.     A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock, the Bundesbank\'s main money supply indicator.     This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity of industry and households which cannot be directly reached with the Bundesbank\'s instruments, Mueller said.     The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the harder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been the case recently, because non-banks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports.     \"If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows,\" he said.     Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high.     In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter.     The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said.     But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities. \"Monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy -- nothing else,\" he said.  \n',money-supply

'The Federal Open Market Committee at its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed.     The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March.     The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds rate \"reference\" range for policy, as in other recent meetings.     At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No conclusions were contained in the minutes.     In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC said that \"somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets.\"     The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president favored some tightening of reserve conditions.     He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November through January and the firm federal funds rate that had prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He also cited the recent declines in the dollar\'s value.     Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed that prompt restraints might avert the need for more substantial tightening later.     Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC minutes showed, \"the members generally felt that policy implementation should be especially alert to the potential need for some firming of reserve conditions.\"     In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in line with current expectations and there were concurrent indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the background of stronger economic data.     One indication of potential price pressure might be a further tendency for the dollar to weaken.     The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer, preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing during the weeks ahead. However, \"most of the members did not want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the conditions for such a move as likely to emerge.\"     The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the dollar\'s value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any significant effect on the Fed\'s economic projections. In addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be made in reducing the federal budget deficit.  \n',money-supply
'U.S. bank reserve, monetary and discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve today clearly indicate that policy is \"on hold\" and may not be changed for weeks or even months, economists said.     \"The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy,\" said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co.     \"These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change,\" said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc.     Fed data released today were all in line with economists\' expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks.     The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln dlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that.     It said that banks\' net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously.     Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6 billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs.     Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3 pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actual positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3.     February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and 20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target.     \"In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money growth,\" said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc.     Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in March after February\'s anemic growth rates. However, they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness.     Commenting on February\'s decline in the key M-2 aggregate, Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February\'s weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2 and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March.     Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the Fed.     Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves.     Given the economy\'s fragility in many sectors, the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next changes policy.     \"Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six pct,\" said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week.     The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added reserves directly through two-day System repurchases.     Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate be largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs.  \n',money-supply
'Federal Reserve data released today indicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks and that none is likely at next week\'s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, economists said.     \"The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of reserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since the beginning of this year,\" said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.     \"These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not change policy,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.     \"The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There\'s no real reason for it to change policy,\" said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.     Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.     All of the economists agreed that the Fed\'s major concern now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was heavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering interest rates further.     Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with expectations and similar to the data for most of this year.     The Fed said that banks\' net free reserves averaged 603 mln dlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.     In the single week to Wednesday, banks\' borrowings at the discount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement period. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to 6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.     The Fed\'s failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.     The Fed\'s absence may be explained by the lack of any pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.     Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week borrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.     Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for two-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of around 6.10 pct.     It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said Wells Fargo\'s Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to 6-1/4 pct band.     Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need are anticipated for the statement period that began today.  More     Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.     To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar coupon \"pass\" may be required later.     There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.  \n',money-supply
'Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.     \"The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed,\" said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.     Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed\'s policy \"has been unchanged up to today.\"     Although Volcker\'s statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today\'s data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.     This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed\'s decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added.     Today\'s data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.     \"The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday,\" said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. \"But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous.\"     \"The Fed couldn\'t have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections,\" added Security Pacific\'s Bannon.     A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.     Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed\'s discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists\' forecasts of about 200 mln.     For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period.     \"There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings,\" said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.     Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said.     \"For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,\" said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. \"I expect it to continue in that vein.\"     \"Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs,\" added First Chicago\'s Johnson. Banks\' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.     After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16.     Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar\'s progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.     \"The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar\'s effect on Fed policy,\" said First Chicago\'s Johnson. \"Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won\'t pull back from easing.\"  \n',money-supply
'Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the U.S. banking system is flush with reserves going into a period of traditional tightness and that overall monetary policy is on hold, economists said.     \"There is ample liquidity.... The Fed is not going to shift gears at the present time or for at least another month,\" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.     \"Technical and seasonal considerations aside, there is nothing for the (credit) market to get excited about,\" added Robert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc.     Adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed\'s discount window averaged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bank statement period ending next Wednesday, compared with 233 mln and 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods.     Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revision in banks\' net free reserves in the two-week period to March 11 to a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln.     Finally, a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14 money center banks were absent from the Fed\'s discount window for the third week running, with the latest week\'s borrowing split between the large regional and the smaller banks.     While modest open market intervention was apparently enough to defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the latest statement period, economists predicted that the Fed would have to be more aggressive in coming weeks.     The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectly on four of the five trading days via system and customer repurchase agreements.     \"Fed funds will be coming under relatively intense pressure,\" said Salomon\'s di Clemente, noting the approaching month- and quarter-end and the round of holidays and tax dates in April.     \"The Fed is faced with a large seasonal adding requirement,\" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc, who expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a coupon purchase in early April.     Economists were also heartened by further signs of a deceleration in money supply growth, not only in the largely discredited M-1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M-2 and M-3 aggregates.     M-1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine, compared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise. Weekly M-2 and M-3 components also hinted at slower overall growth.     \"The M-1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect we are on our way to another moderate set of M-2 and M-3 figures for March,\" said Salomon\'s di Clemente. Merrill\'s McCarthy said they could even come in below the bottom of their respective target ranges.     In February, M-2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upper limit and M-3 was 20.8 billion beneath.     Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnson\'s encouraging remarks on inflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas, some economists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lend support to calls for further accommodation here.     \"Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards in rates before anything else,\" said Salomon\'s di Clemente, adding that the key swing factor will continue to be the strength of the U.S. economy.     Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economy\'s health would remain the main influence on policy but, contrary to di Clemente, he said that recent signs of faster growth and inflation could lead to higher rates first.     Drexel\'s Ramirez did not commit herself either way, adding that the next major move may have to wait until April 14 when February\'s U.S. trade data are due for release.  \n',money-supply
'The Federal Reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to supply temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase agreements, economists said.

'French money supply, measured in terms of M-3, rose a provisional one pct in January after falling 0.7 pct in December, the Bank of France said.     M-3 is the main money supply aggregate used by the French monetary authorities. It has been joined as a second main money supply aggregate for 1987 by M-2, which rose a provisional 1.2 pct in January after falling a confirmed 0.9 pct in December.     Calculated on a three-month moving average basis, M-3 rose 4.4 pct year-on-year in the quarter based on December after rising 5.4 pct in the quarter centred on September.     The M-2 aggregate, centred on a three-month moving average, rose year-on-year by four pct, within a 1987 target range of four to six pct.     M-1 rose 2.5 pct after a 1.1 pct fall in December. M-1 measures notes and coins in circulation plus sight deposits.     M-2 adds in short-term bank deposits and M-3 adds in other short-term deposits.

Gross currency reserves in the week rose by 200 mln marks to 109.5 billion. Foreign liabilities fell 100 mln to 22.9 billion, giving a net currency reserves increase of 300 mln to 86.6 billion.     Commercial bank minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank fell 300 mln marks to 51.9 billion marks at the end of February, averaging 51.2 billion over the month.

In absolute terms, the measure rose to 223.2 billion marks in February from 221.8 billion in the prior month.     The data showed that the stock grew at an annualized 8.6 pct over the six months to February, slower than the 9.4 pct rise in the same period to January.     Of the two components comprising central bank money stock, cash in circulation rose to 111.7 billion marks in February from 110.9 billion in January, the Bundesbank data showed.

Minimum reserve requirements on domestic liabilities grew to 111.5 billion marks in February from 110.9 billion in January.

'West Germany\'s money supply growth slowed in February after January\'s sharp rise but the trend is still definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement.     Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was only moderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits with statutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply, short-term time deposits fell after expanding unusually strongly in January.     In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdings of German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January.     Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct.     In the six months to February, M2, which excludes time deposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cash and sight deposits, rose seven pct.     International transactions of non-banks again led to a significant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said.     Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against foreigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1 billion marks in February, little changed from January\'s rise.     But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of the inflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary effect on money growth, the Bundesbank said.     Outstanding bank credits to companies and private individuals remained virtually unchanged in February.     A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflected the foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise in long-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities.     At the end of February total bank credits to the private sector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level.     The effect of public authority cash movements on the money supply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said.     Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority paper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercial banks and the Bundesbank.     Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money supply growth to a larger extent than in January.     A total of 7.7 billion marks in long-term funds was placed with banks after 6.6 billion the previous month.  \n',money-supply

'Monetary and credit growth rates in New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels following the Reserve Bank\'s move to tighten liquidity late last year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said.

The bank official said commercial bank reserves were 22.19 billion pesos at the end of December, when reserves required were 21.59 billion.     She said the surplus of 597 mln pesos, compared with a deficit of 390 mln pesos a month earlier and a deficit of 1.64 billion at the end of 1985, reflected political uncertainty in the last quarter of 1986.

'The Bank of Spain has extended the reserve requirement for banks to their convertible peseta funds in an attempt to curb speculation in short-term capital which is currently fuelling money supply growth.     In a statement issued late last night, the central bank said convertible peseta accounts, funds which are not subject to exchange controls, would also be subject to a 19 pct reserve requirement with effect from Friday.     Convertible peseta funds had been previously exempt from reserve requirements.     The measure comes one week after the central bank raised reserve requirements on domestic deposits by one percentage point to 19 pct, also with effect on Friday.     Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- have attracted a large influx of speculative foreign capital which is threatening the government\'s monetary targets.     They say this influx is largely responsible for Spain\'s principal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP), to have grown by an estimated 17 pct annualised rate in February, compared with January\'s 8.3 pct rise and an 11.4 pct rise during the whole of 1986. The target for 1987 is eight pct.     The Bank of Spain today did not provide assistance funds to banks in a move to drain excess liquidity from the money market. Liquidity will be further tightened by the fortnightly Treasury Bill auction tomorrow and Friday\'s hike in reserve requirements, expected to absorb over 200 billion pesetas from the system.     The immediate reaction was a hike in interbank interest rates today to 13.75/14.00 pct from yesterday\'s 13.46 pct average for deposits.     Bank of Spain officials said this was an understandable response \"given that the market is short of funds.\"     But banking sources noted that a continued rise in interest rates would neutralize the central bank\'s attempts to curtail short-term speculation with foreign funds by making the Spanish money markets more attractive.  \n',money-supply
'The Bank of Spain said it raised the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened money supply and inflation targets.     In a statement issued late last night, the central bank said the measure would take effect from March 13.     \"In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the monetary and inflation targets set by the government,\" the statement said.     Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200 billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve requirement allowed by law is 20 pct.     The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the Bank of Spain\'s key overnight call money rate, which now stands at 13.5 pct. At today\'s auction, however, the bank left the rate unchanged.     Spain\'s principal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of 8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of 1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987.     Banking sources said that although the January money supply figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared to have accelerated in February, raising government concern.     Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that prices were under control.     Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from six pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during 1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.  \n',money-supply

'Slower than expected growth in Britain\'s narrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur a further cut in U.K. Interest rates if a surge in sterling\'s value requires such a move, economic analysts said.     M0, the only targeted money supply measure left after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the official target for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budget speech on Tuesday, fell an adjusted 3/4 to one pct in February.     On an annual basis, this put M0 growth at four to 4-1/2 pct, in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct.     \"The M0 data are much better than we expected,\" said Robert Thomas, economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities.     He and other analysts said while the better than expected M0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a new interest rate cut, they removed an obstacle to such a move.     Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despite buoyant retail sales in February, advancing an adjusted 2.2 pct after a fall of the same size in January.     Analysts said the M0 measure, reflecting variations in consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects, was not an adequate indicator to determine interest rates.     \"The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 is important ... In practice, it is likely to be the exchange rate and the election which call the tune,\" Lloyds Merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment.     Richard Jeffrey, economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett, said in a comment: \"It is unlikely that (Lawson) will respond to signals from M0 alone ... Reinforcement from exchange rate trends is necessary before action is taken.\"     \"With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are made in response to signals from this narrow money variable, the City has been forced to take it seriously,\" he added.     Noting this point, Thomas said market fears at the end of last year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared.     This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U.K. Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the pound above unofficial targets, analysts said.     Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed between finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada at their Paris meeting last month, they added.   U.K. Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since the Paris agreement, once on March 11, and again yesterday when foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cut in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget.     They stand at 10 pct now, and foreign exchange dealers and analysts expect them to shed another half-point in the coming week.     Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher than expected increase in February sterling M3, which pushed the annual growth rate to almost 19 pct, well above the previous target of 11 to 15 pct.     Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate the improvement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past few months had been reversed, but firm conclusions could only be drawn after revised data are released on March 31.     Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to watch the sterling M3 target, and Lawson\'s move to scrap it altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its credibility as a key factor in monetary policy.  \n',money-supply
'U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 228 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday March 18, the Federal Reserve said.     Total borrowings in the week rose 83 mln dlrs to 502 mln dlrs, with extended credits up three mln dlrs at 274 mln dlrs. The week was the first half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowing in the prior week averaged 148 mln dlrs.     Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on March 11, the Fed estimated that banks had daily average net free reserves of 759 mln dlrs rather than the 660 mln dlrs first reported.     A Fed spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed\'s reserve projections in the first week of the latest bank statement period.

On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks.

'U.S. money supply growth is slowing down rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the Federal Reserve\'s main monetary aggregates may even have contracted in February.     A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the Fed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid growth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy was justified on account of weakness in the economy.         M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported today, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs. The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.     M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3. With other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit accounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is set for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.     M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of falling interest rates and banking deregulation.     But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is likely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.     \"The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they\'re all sending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows at the Fed,\" McCarthy said.     Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, \"We have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It\'s coming in a lot weaker than I thought.\"         The economists were quick to caution that one month\'s data prove nothing, especially because money growth previously had been so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct rate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.     Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a slowdown in the business expansion.     But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.     McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter progresses. \"Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as they were a month ago,\" he noted.     He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.     Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct or less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national product for the first quarter proved to be weak. \"You\'d certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past.\"     There was certainly nothing in the Fed\'s latest balance sheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under way, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.     Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to solve America\'s most urgent economic problem, its massive trade deficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to close the trade gap, Brusca said \"I\'m not prepared to be all that optimistic about the bond market.\"  \n',money-supply

'Thailand\'s improving economy will likely cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at end-February, private bankers said.     Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.     Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the Bangkok Bank Ltd, said Thailand\'s strong export performance, its relatively high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market, and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan, contributed to the projected sharp rise.     Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.     A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.     Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.     Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold, special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target is equivalent to five-and-a-half months\' worth of imports.  \n',reserves

'French official reserves fell 45.06 billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from 421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.     It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the European Monetary System (EMS).     Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs during the month, the ministry said.     This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund, counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).     But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a result of using very short-term financing instruments.     The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the franc.

'Additional capital inflows of 1.5 billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico\'s reserves to about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters.     Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has forced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986.     Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of funds available for badly needed investment.     Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months, Gurria noted.     Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on the commercial banks\' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support contingency facility. That money will be available until April 1988 if Mexico\'s export receipts and the price of oil fall below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said today, \"We expect we\'ll never have to use it.\"     Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World Bank.     Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods.     He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month.     Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results.     Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF for the rest of 1987.     Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris Club.     Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella agreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs of official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks.

'Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves, swollen by strong trade surpluses to a record 53 billion U.S. Dlrs, are becoming a problem, government officials said.     Official figures show the latest level compares with the previous record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26 billion in late March 1986.     Central bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the increase in reserves was the result of heavy intervention by the bank on the local interbank market. It bought nearly two billion U.S. Dlrs between March 5 and 23, he said.     Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government\'s Council for Economic Planning and Development, tolds the rising reserves were \"a big headache for Taiwan.\"     He said the government expects heavier pressure from the U.S., Where protectionist bills are being proposed against nations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluses with the U.S.     Wang said the government would launch new measures within the next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open the market wider to foreign products, especially those from the U.S.     Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan\'s trade surplus, which rose to 2.73 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier. Nearly 90 pct of the surplus was with the U.S.     Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien agreed with Wang\'s remarks and said efforts to avert U.S. Protectionism were running out of time. \"We must do it quickly or face retaliation from Washington,\" he said.     He said the measures would include removal of trade barriers on insurance and inland services for U.S. Companies.     Chang Chi-cheng said the central bank could not stop buying U.S. Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fear the strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses.     He said the bank is studying revision of the foreign exchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls, but declined to give details.     The Taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985. It opened at 34.38 to the U.S. Dollar today and is expected to rise further to 33 in June and to 32 by end-year, some foreign bankers said.  \n',reserves
'Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves hit a new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year earlier, the central bank said.     Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase came mainly from the bank\'s purchases of more than one billion U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and March 4.     He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.     Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise, but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.     In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S. Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the U.S. Taiwan\'s 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2 billion, according to official statistics.     Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, tolds the government is planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half of this year.

The China Times, which has close ties with the government, quoted central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng as saying the government had agreed in principle to liberalise financial restrictions.     The bank was considering proposals to allow firms and individuals to hold foreign exchange and invest in foreign stocks for the first time, Chang was quoted as saying.     All foreign exchange must now be handed to local banks and exchanged for local currency. Firms and individuals may only invest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit.     Central bank and other government officials were not available to comment on the report.     Economists said it was likely that the government would ease foreign exchange controls, but only gradually.

The figure was sharply lower than the 1.02 billion dinars in outstanding loans at the end of September, according to latest Central Bank figures.     Rifa\'i dismissed the view of some bankers and economists here that the dinar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies, is overvalued.     \"The dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserve its stability,\" he said.     The prime minister said he hoped the next Arab summit would tackle the question of continuing financial aid to Jordan. Under a 10-year agreement reached in 1978, Jordan was to receive a total of 1.25 billion dlrs annually from Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help it resist Israel.

This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.

He said the EC not only ignored Manila\'s request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but proposed a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries.     Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers, he noted that \"I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value.\"     He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services.     \"The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed,\" he said.  \n',trade

'Australia accused the U.S. of increasing protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to Washington\'s special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules on agricultural trade.     Robert Arnott, Australia\'s delegate to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.     \"Australia today said the United States\' goals of reducing U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by actions which in fact increased protection in trade in agriculture,\" the Australian delegation said in a statement.     \"The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture,\" Arnott told the meeting.     Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a justification for \"dubious protective measures\" by the U.S. He listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to close the U.S. sugar market to imports.     He also tolds the waiver allowed Washington to impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic support programs. This covered imports of dairy products, peanuts, cotton and sugar.     Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the GATT, tolds: \"These charges have been made since the very beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural policy, part of our law when we joined the GATT\".     \"We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with their programs.

'The strong contribution of exports to the growth in Australia\'s gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of the data, private economists polled bys said.     Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, after rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a year earlier.     Equally significant was the decline in both private and government spending, they said.     Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth quarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureau figures show. Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and government spending by 0.2.     Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd said the government\'s aim of reducing the current account deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut imports appeared to be working.     However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keep growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports would increase and worsen the balance of payments.     Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the result was positive because growth was export-driven.     But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the growth in exports disclosed in other statistics.     The economists\' comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul Keating in a statement issued in Canberra.     Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a reduction in the current account deficit, notably the decline in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports.     A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter underscored the need to continue restraint in wages, prices and public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia\'s competitiveness, he said.     \"It is clear that through the continued application of that strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth pattern,\" he added.  \n',trade
'Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reform it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis.     In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing abilities of a number of developing countries.      He said major countries should be showing leadership on this problem.     \"We will be giving close attention to the processes in the OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) and elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to agricultural trade reform,\" Dawkins said.     The Venice summit is scheduled for June.     He said Australia\'s interests in the Uruguay Round, the eighth under the GATT, are wide ranging. Dawkins said he sees the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore confidence in the multilateral system.     Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, but it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these processes.     \"We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on standstill and rollback are carried into practice.\"     The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years, he said.  \n',trade

Baldrige said he was making his prediction without having seen the February trade figures, but he said that the volume of imports has dropped beginning with the fourth quarter of 1986 and will continue to drop in this quarter.     The eventual turnaround in the monthly trade figures will reflect the impact of the decline in the dollar, Baldrige said.

The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen and European currencies, but has changed very little against the currencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and Taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar.     As a result, efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over the past year and a half have done little to improve the trade deficits with those countries.

De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, \"the only way we could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems.\"     He said if a textile bill was enacted, \"we will impose taxes on a lot of American products.\"  He said \"it would be stupid. We have to avoid that.\"     He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted  shipments of Asian textiles.     De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve EC trade issues, saying \"each time we come in contact, it a conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West.\"     He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross the Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.     \"This is not the way to work in a serious way between two big powers,\" De Croo said.      \n',trade

'inflation plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.     Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country\'s 250 pct inflation rate.     But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.     \"The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was inflation, at least the economy worked,\" a leading bank economist said.     The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and 1985 Brazil\'s annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.     For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged under 150 mln.  \n',trade

Now it is time for Brazil to do likewise,\" Archer said at the opening of a national software conference.

'Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said his country\'s foreign debt crisis could only be solved by changes in the international financial system.     Speaking to a business conference he said \"It is not Brazil that has to make adjustments with the IMF (International Monetary Fund). It is the international financial community that is taking away resources from the developing countries.\"     \"The crisis is not in Brazil, a country that has had the third biggest trade surplus ...In the past two years Brazil had remitted 24 billion dlrs in debt servicing and received only two billion in fresh funds,\" he added.     Funaro said that during his recent trip to the U.S., Europe and Japan to explain Brazil\'s decision last month to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt, he stressed the country\'s commitment to growth.     \"We need to and will make the effort (to solve the debt problem) but we cannot make an effort that means we stop growing,\" he said, adding that political and not purely commercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis.     Brazil, whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largest in the developing world, has been under pressure from official and private creditors to work out an economic adjustment program with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreign payments problems.     President Jose Sarney\'s government has repeatedly refused to approach the Fund, arguing that an IMF programme would lead to recession. Funaro said that in his talks with creditors he had tried to restore credibility in the country in the hope of finding a lasting solution to the debt problem.     \"We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be one of continuous crisis.\"     To sustain internal growth Brazil would have to import more machinery and equipment this year and export fewer raw materials. The country was thus targetting a fall in this year\'s trade surplus to 8.0 billion dlrs from 1986\'s 9.5 billion.     Domestically, Funaro said economies had led to a reduction in the public sector deficit to 2.7 pct of gross domestic product in 1986, the lowest for many years and that this should fall to 1.5 pct this year.  \n',trade
'The trade surplus doubled in february to 261 mln dlrs from January\'s 129 mln, but was  below the 628 mln of February 1986, official figures show.

Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln in February 1986 because of lower prices, he added.     Fendt said that although the February results were lower than the average expected for the rest of the year, the government\'s target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9.5 billion dlrs.     Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled 22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.     Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with government plans to foster economic growth.     Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above the traditional average for Brazil.     In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oil and wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in the same 1986 period.     This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilian industry to equip to raise production and is perfectly compatible with the government\'s program for economic growth, Fendt added.  \n',trade

Brazilian and U.S. Trade officials held the first of a three-day meeting today in Brasilia to discuss the issue.

The 1984 restraints established that for 1987 Brazil\'s steel exports to the U.S. Could not exceed 632,000 tonnes, increasing to 640,000 tonnes in 1988 and 670,000 tonnes in 1989, the last of the five-year deadline set by the agreements.

'Britain today called on Japan to increase foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism and the harm it would bring to it and other trading nations.     British Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon said Japan must heed a report issued by a Japanese government advisory body in December calling for faster domestic demand to help cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy.     \"I recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to Japan\'s domestic economy,\" he told a group of Japanese businessmen in London.     \"But these short term difficulties should not be allowed to deflect Japan from the fundamental reforms necessary,\" he said.     \"It is not just a domestic issue for Japan. If import propensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from protectionist lobbies, particularly in the U.S. With whom Japan has so massive a surplus,\" he said.     \"They may well succeed in securing action by governments which would be highly injurious to trading nations like Japan and the U.K.\"     Channon said there had been substantial growth in the volume of trade between Japan and Britain, amounting to 6.2 billion sterling (9.8 billion dlrs) last year.     But he added: \"Regrettably too much of it was in one direction, with the Japanese selling us 3.7 billion sterling (5.8 billion dlrs) more than we sold them.\"  \n',trade

British frustration over the lopsided trade balance - nearly six billion dlrs in Japan\'s favour last year - has reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howard said.     Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and Wireless from having a major role in the international telephone market in Japan.     \"I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading relations,\" Howard said. \"We simply aren\'t prepared to continue to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a long time.\"     Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable to comment on Howard\'s meeting with their minister.     But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are increasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade.     Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied.     Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the telecommunications issue.     \"There are measures which are under consideration if we continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,\" he added, but gave no details.     He said he had received a reassuring response from the Japanese he has spoken with.     \"But of course we\'ve had reassuring signs from the Japanese for quite some time,\" he added. \"What I\'ve made plain is we expect to see action.\"     Howard ruled out using powers in Britain\'s Financial Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices.

'A senior British official said that protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the global trading system.     Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers, \"the community would have to retaliate.\"     His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.     Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress.     De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.     Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.     Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.     Channon said Japan\'s trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.     \"The more united pressure there could be, the better,\" he said.     Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes.     He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.     \"But if both sides drew back from the brink that time,\" he said, \"\"it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion.\"     Channon added that \"There is increasing reesentment in Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines.\"     He said other potential conflicts are already in sight - alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils - and \"the commuity and the United States must therefore learn to manage their relations better.\"     He said another bill to let the United States retaliate against a nation if that nation\'s market was not open to U.S. goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.     He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not by the United States, adding \"if the (trade) law is to be interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is to happen to the rest of us?\"      \n',trade

Jopling also criticized a recent proposal still under consideration by the EC for a tax on vegetable and fish oils.

The Agriculture committee tomorrow will begin drafting amendments to an omnibus trade bill now before the House.     Responding to the Republican plan, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said they favor a flexible, targeted use of EEP instead of an across-the-board program which they termed too costly.     The Republican Congressmen also said they will offer an amendment to the trade bill instructing the U.S. Agriculture Department to value the bonus commodities used for EEP at the market value, rather than the cost of acquisition.     But Lyng said USDA already plans to change to market value accounting rather than acquisition value, in order to avoid hitting a funding ceiling for eep of 1.5 billion dlrs.

'Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time.     She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices, Carney said.     Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively.     Carney later tolds the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.     European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the European Community, voiced reservations about some of the principles.     Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way.     \"The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion,\" she said.

'External Affairs Minister Joe Clark today vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. action against Canadian potash exports, but also warned against raising the alarm too early in the dispute.     In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimously Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million U.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry.     \"We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that Canadian interests are well protected,\" Clark told the House of Commons in the daily question period.     But he said the opposition parties should be careful \"not to raise false alarms too early.\"     The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department\'s trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potash producers from New Mexico, claiming unfair government subsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada\'s shipments.     Canada, the world\'s largest potash producer, exported 9.8 mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a third going to the U.S.     Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer, comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan.     In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the ruling as just another \"trade harrassment\" from the U.S. and criticized Clark\'s assurances the country\'s interests would be protected.     \"We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,\" Axworthy said.     Canada\'s Progressive Conservative government agreed to impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with the U.S.     Axworthy urged the government to present Canada\'s case to world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade.     But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the U.S.     \"What we are seeking to do is put in place a better system,\" Clark said.     Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed confidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problem stems from low international commodity prices and not government subsidies.     \"The reality of the problem and the injury is caused worldwide,\" he said. \"It\'s caused by a downturn in the commodity price for fertilizer, whether it\'s potash fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer or whatever.\"  \n',trade

Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting for more than a year in an effort to work out an agreement.     \"The most urgent problem now is the trade question because that has to be decided within the next 10 months,\" Clark told the Commonwealth Club of California. \"We have a fast track authority from your Congress for approval or rejection of whatever the negotiators achieve.\"     Clark said that, as a practical matter, an initial agreement must be reached by late September or early October.     He listed environmental questions, particularly acid rain, and defense as the second and third most important bilateral issues facing Ottawa and Washington.     On Wednesday, President Reagan announced that he will seek 2.5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rain problem. Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in advance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.     In a question-and-answer session with the public affairs group, Clark said that the two countries must find better mechanisms for resolving their trade disputes.     \"This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted on corn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were quasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in place now are not working adequately in either of our interests,\" he said.     Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington\'s rules on government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, he said.     \"There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order to secure substantial contracts in the United States, have had to move their head offices out of our country into your country because you have national procurement requirements,\" he said.     In turn, he added, the United States would like to change some of the procurement requirements that exist at the provincial government level in Canada.     Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions.     \"What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, in the first instance, to propose, and then governments and congresses will have judge,\" he said.     In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United States has tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports to its northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan. \"Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last year than you bought from Canada,\" he said.  \n',trade

'A group of Canadian lawmakers from Ontario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major trade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress.     At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, an organization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of the Ontario Parliament\'s Select Committee on Economic Affairs, said the exemption would help trade relations.     The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would harm the U.S. economy.     Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any grounds.     Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S. congressmen, \"I can understand (the trade bill).

Canada is the United States\' largest trading partner, with two-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985, according to the coalition. But the U.S. ran up a 23 billion dlr deficit in manufactured goods that year compared to a 14 billion dlr surplus in services trade with its neighbour.  \n',trade
'China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.     But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports.     The official International Business newspaper today published China\'s demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.     \"It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports,\" the editorial said.     \"The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).     \"Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries,\" it added.     The paper also printed an article by China\'s commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that \"all kinds of difficulties and restrictions\" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.     He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.  \n',trade

The New China News Agency quoted the Bureau as saying foreign trade totalled 9.3 billion dlrs in the period, of which exports were worth 4.3 billion dlrs.     The bureau said total trade volume was up 2.5 pct on the same 1986 period, with exports up 18.1 pct, but it gave no other comparative figures.

'China should tighten imports of ordinary goods and restrict or even forbid import of goods which can be made domestically, Premier Zhao Ziyang said.     He told the National People\'s Congress, China\'s parliament, that the country\'s foreign exchange is limited and must be used where it is most needed.     \"We should expand production of import substitutes and increase their proportion,\" he said.     On exports, China should increase its proportion of manufactured goods, especially textiles, light industrial goods, electronics and machinery, he said.     Zhao said China should lower the cost of exports and control the export of goods that incur too much loss. In 1986 China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs, down from a record 14 billion in 1985.     Zhao said China should work to provide a more favourable investment environment for foreign businessmen. It should use foreign funds for production and construction, with stress on firms making goods for export or import substitutes.     China should also earn more foreign exchange from tourists and contracted labour abroad, he added.  \n',trade

'French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on superpower arms control moves and trade issues.     French officials said a major aim of Chirac\'s visit was to present France\'s concern that the United States might ignore European security interests in any accord with Moscow on removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent.     But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats said.     France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets, conventional forces and chemical weapons.     Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position saying: \"Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.\"     Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a dispute between two leading research institutes over patent rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS.     In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).     \"This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,\" Reagan said at the signing ceremony.      He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80 per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation.     The foundation would also raise private funds and would donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less developed countries.      Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House East Room, with Reagan describing France as \"America\'s oldest ally in war and peace.\"      \"I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new diseases and drugs,\" Chirac replied.     But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on over the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise in protectionism in the U.S. Congress.      A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to sell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of lessening surplus stocks.     Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume, during his two-day visit to Washington.     The U.S. official described the idea as a \"grain producers\' OPEC\" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- and said it went against the Reagan administration\'s desire to lessen government intervention in trade.  \n',trade
'World Bank President Barber Conable expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread throughout the industrial world.     But in an interview withs, Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war.     Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth.     \"We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn\'t close at the same time,\" he said.     He said the U.S. action against Japan was \"a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy.\"     The interview came just before next week\'s semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.     Referring to Brazil\'s recent interest payments moratorium, Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched.     He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform.     The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment and reducing government\'s role in the economy.     \"We\'re comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect, however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,\" Conable said.     He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time.     He noted, \"the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt.\"     Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October, 1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank.     Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank\'s organization to be completed in the next several weeks.     He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency.     the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency\'s 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities.     \"I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow,\" Conable said.     However, he said \"I don\'t believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I don\'t believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose.\"     He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis.     Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues.     On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that \"I don\'t have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development.\"     He added, \"so I don\'t feel a great calling to personalize the institution.\"     On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank\'s International Development Association was earmarked for Africa.     Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those in the Sub-Sahara, during next week\'s meetings.  \n',trade
'Top U.S. and European farm trade and government representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance.     Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production.     \"It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful,\" U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Administrator William Bailey said.     Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment.     The need for urgent reforms is justified by the \"imbalance and tensions of the world economy,\" the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Jean-Claude Paye said.     And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he noted.     Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas.     Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of Cargill (USA), one of the world\'s largest cereal houses.     Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.     However, \"differentiated policy treatment is required\" to take account of large disparities in the situation around the EC, he said.     \"Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the Community,\" he said.  \n',trade

'Already strained relations between the U.S. And the European Community (EC) are likely to get worse before they get better, director general of the Dutch Economics Ministry\'s foreign affairs division Frans Engering said.     Speaking at an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in The Hague, Engering noted the developing history of crises over steel, citrus and pasta, and warned of more to come.     \"I consider the strident tone of US declarations on Airbus ill-advised, and the EC fats and oils tax proposal a dangerous provocation,\" he said. \"I feel that we shall probably have to deal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future.\"     Not only is the US Congress clearly very determined to get the American balance of payments into better shape, but the risks of brinkmanship are all the greater because the EC has its own constraints in meeting outside pressure, Engering noted.     \"If we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable that we keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war, then I think the answer is probably yes,\" he said.     In order to reduce these tensions, decision-making in the EC must become less self-centred, and the US Administration will have to exercise the authority to convince Congress and pressure groups of the need for accommodation, he added.  \n',trade

'The European Community (EC) and Soviet-led Comecon ended talks here, having made progress on setting up formal trade relations, but no breakthrough because of Comecon\'s refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of the EC, delegates said.     Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of a joint declaration setting up official relations after 30 years of mutual non-recognition. John Maslen, head of the EC delegation, tolds as he emerged from the final session: \"We made some progress, but we have called for another meeting.\"     Officials, who asked not to be named, said the Comecon team had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC.     Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An EC negotiator taking part in the three-day talks said: \"We wanted the territorial clause in, but Comecon said no.\"     A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was made towards clarifying positions, but another meeting would be necessary to complete the work.     Any decision in principle to set up relations would require approval by the Community\'s Council of Ministers and by the executive committee of Comecon.     Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads the East bloc delegation, tolds ahead of today\'s session: \"We have narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but not on all questions.\"     Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the Community, he replied: \"This question is not contained in the draft which our side presented.\"     West German diplomats said they would insist on including the clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement.     The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading blocs here last September and the first-ever direct talks between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic relations in January.     The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite non-recognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a five billion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about half the deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price of Soviet oil imported by the EC.  \n',trade

'The European Community (EC) considers talks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks on other trade reform in the present GATT round, Willy de Clercq, external relations commissioner of the EC, said.     He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to reach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade.     He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That included agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT.     Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT round include reform of trade in merchandise and services.     De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand.     Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter, also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade reform was reached as early as possible.     But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after long and hard negotiations, and the EC did not want changes.     \"We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached, and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one undertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks, no fast track, no slow track. It has just one track, the track - and that\'s all,\" de Clercq said.     \"If you start selecting priorities, your priority is not my priority. We say that agriculture is urgent, but it\'s not the only urgent thing,\" he said.

'Sir Roy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, said pending U.S. trade legislation is a misguided attempt to deal with the nation\'s trade deficit and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form.     \"To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by legislation is a mistake,\" he told the Foreign Trade Association here.     Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which he warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on a product-for-product basis.     \"Retaliation does not have to be matched product to product,\" Denman said.     He said in the case of textiles import restrictions, however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports.     \"Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on European exports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likely to retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports to Europe,\" Denman said.     He also took exception to U.S. proposals to require countries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. to cut those surpluses or face special tariffs.     \"This would conflict with international obligations, throw a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and could easily boomerang,\" he warned of the tariff proposals.     Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seek reciprocity in specific trade sectors.     \"Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers would simply lead to retaliation from the other party,\" he said, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in another.  \n',trade
'The European Community Commission has charged the United States with breaking international trade rules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market and said it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT.     In the latest of a series of trade disputes with Washington, the executive authority alleged that a section of the U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminated against imported products in favour of domestically-produced goods.     The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to rule on whether the section in question, which officials said had proved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules.     Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures if, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed to bring the disputed section into line with international rules.     The executive\'s decision to go to GATT follows a complaint to it by the Dutch company Akzo AKZO.AS, whose \"aramid\" synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market because of charges by the U.S. Firm Dupont that the fibres violate the American company\'s patents.     Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), was discriminatory and incompatible with GATT provisions.     The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the U.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over imported products. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the ITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court.     \"Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourable than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods produced in the United States,\" it said in a statement.  \n',trade
'The European Community (EC) has warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S. trading partners.     The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.     A copy of the letter was made available tos.     Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry.     But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices.     Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved.     He said \"If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory, then the United States would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners.\"     Denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws, saying \"in the last resort, any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest.\"     Otherwise, he said, \"the risk would be counter-reaction by trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the United States.\"     Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims.     Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.     \"Changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States alone on the world trading system,\" he said.     House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by President Reagan.

'The European Community (EC) yesterday warned Japan and the United States, its main trading partners, that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC\'s relations with both countries.     EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan\'s continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make a greater effort to open up its markets. They also said they were disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress that would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were prepared to react. The U.S. Administration has already distanced itself from the bill.     EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written to his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, outlining the EC\'s concerns.     The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S. Moves towards protectionism. \"The adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateral relations,\" it said.     Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it said.     In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said they \"deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more.\"     The statement said the EC would continue to insist that Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand.     Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take appropriate action where necessary.     One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. \"It will be back on the table again and again,\" the diplomat said.     De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said, \"There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the Community concerning trade relations with Japan.\"     But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war, and the ministers called for more cooperation with Japan in industry and research.  \n',trade
'Japanese microchip makers are being strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan\'s market to foreign chips, industry analysts said.     But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space, they said.     U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.     \"MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) associate vice president Peter Wolffe.     Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject to the pact\'s price controls.     The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.     U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.     But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp said it would cut production in line with MITI\'s request.     \"NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI\'s demands,\" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. \"Once NEC cuts production, it means they all have.\"     Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.     \"The best way to lower cost is to produce more,\" said Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.     Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt Aizawa said.     Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new restrictions, some industry officials said.     \"It\'s like tax avoidance schemes,\" said Steve Donovan, head of MMI Japan K.K. \"As soon as you close one route, another opens.\"     MITI\'s pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier shrugged off MITI guidance.     \"It\'s getting to be like communism,\" said one.     But analysts said output cuts could help by making it easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.     \"They\'re going to have to start running their businesses like businesses,\" Bache\'s Wolffe said.     MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry officials said response has been mixed at best.     \"There has been some change, but it\'s not across the board,\" said one U.S. Spokesman. \"The companies have a varying degree of urgency.\"     The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.     Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.     Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they said.     Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S. Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.     Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S. Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.     \"The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn\'t even have an office here,\" a source close to the industry said. \"You could question just how committed they are.\"     In addition, some industry analysts question the effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third country chipmakers such as those in South Korea.     \"(South) Korea\'s gaining market share,\" said one analyst. \"They\'re the real winners from the agreement.\"  \n',trade
'Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago.     Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. Some of them are \"too sophisticated to convert into financial terms,\" one banking source said.     But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate.     They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland\'s economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.     \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said.     The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission.     According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders.     But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation.\"     A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed.     Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.     Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons.  \"Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons,\" said one expert. \"It\'s an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy.\"     \"There\'s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today\'s reality.     Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry.     \"MFN doesn\'t really mean anything, only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now,\" said one Western envoy.     He said Polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland\'s efforts to regain entry.     Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently.     Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\"     While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said \"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won\'t cut any ice. The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity.\"     Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States.     He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States, \"but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners.\"     He stressed that the U.S. \"had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland\'s partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt.\"     Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role.     \"As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations,\" he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.  \n',trade
'The U.S. Congress is making Japan, with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around America\'s record trade deficit.     \"Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers to our exports,\" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said.     \"If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,\" the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the trade bill.     Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging bill is being readied for probable House approval next month.     Japan\'s bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.     Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to the dollar\'s decline in world currency markets as a reason to press Japan to buy more U.S. goods.     They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.     In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S. semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for Japan\'s failure to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.     Congress also has been been angered by the administration\'s lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications goods, and financial services.     The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and measures to force the administration take tough action against foreign trade barriers and unfair competition.     Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese products or make them more expensive with higher duties.     The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win temporary relief from surges in imports.     The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.     Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key Democrats to press for passage of the amendment.     The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per cent a year for three years.     \"I\'m tired of going into companies and having managers say to me, \'We\'re not over competing in Japan because we can\'t compete in the marketplace.\' That argument needs to be taken away from American business,\" Gephardt said.     The administration has said it could not support a trade bill containing such a provision.      \n',trade
'The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, economists said.     \"The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in 1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be screaming at those countries about their exports,\" said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.     Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S. after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.     Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress, the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.     The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar\'s steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods.     U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan\'s trade surplus this year.     But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.     \"In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing. Now it\'s NIC-bashing,\" said Robert Chandross, of Lloyds Bank PLC.     Asia\'s four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.     The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.     And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6 billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.     Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.     Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.     For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan\'s trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.     The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the area of \"big-ticket\" manufactured goods, notably cars.     Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.     \"The NICs\' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,\" said Bob Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.     The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea\'s computer products exports, 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment.     A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.     While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.     But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.     Morgan expects Taiwan\'s overall trade surplus to grow to 18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and Korea\'s to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.     Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.     \"A lot of Korea and Taiwan\'s exports to the U.S. have been at Japan\'s expense,\" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.     February\'s Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.     But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work with a sizeable lag, economists say.     The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan\'s and Korea\'s currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.     But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.     \"We\'ve not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes,\" said Bethlehem Steel\'s Wendt.     And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.     Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will get given the administration\'s free-trade stance. \"It\'s hard to see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then the question is, will it have teeth?\" one economist said.      \n',trade
'Egypt and the Soviet Union are expected to sign an agreement in Moscow next week settling Cairo\'s three billion dlr military debt, Egyptian officials said.     One official, who asked to remain anonymous, tolds a draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future interest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 year repayment term.     Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday.     Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow on Tuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue.     One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate for trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on a rate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar which Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar.     The officials said part of the debt would be paid in exports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture.     Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the door for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built steel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year development plan ending June 30 1992.     Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprint and glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military hardware, the officials said.     An estimated 65 pct of Egypt\'s arsenal is still made up of Soviet-supplied equipment, one official said.     Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977 when then-president Anwar Sadat broke with its long-standing ally and turned to the U.S..  \n',trade
'The Japanese ambassador to the U.S. Suggested that Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone make efforts to present \"advanced\' proposals on trade issues when he visits Washington next month.     Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga made the recommendation at a meeting with Nakasone, Kyodo News Service said.     Matsunaga also advised that the prime minister should be prepared to discuss U.S.-Japan economic issues.     Matsunaga cited issues such as a U.S.-Japan micro chip trade pact, foreign access to the Kansai international airport project, and a new international telecommunications firm.     Matsunaga returned on Sunday to report to Japanese leaders on recent U.S. Developments over trade, in preparation for Nakasone\'s visit to Washington, April 29 to May 5.     Kyodo quoted Nakasone as telling reporters after meeting the envoy, \"I entirely accept what ambassador Matsunaga recommended.\" Nakasone did not elaborate.     The U.S.-Japan trade dispute intensified last week when President Ronald Reagan said the U.S. Would impose heavy tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation against alleged Japanese breach of the computer chip trade pact.     Meanwhile, Nakasone\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is to consider measures to boost imports and open up the Japanese market, such as government purchase of supercomputers and expanding foreign access to the Kansai airport project, party sources said.     The LDP international economic affairs council was responding to Nakasone\'s request for measures to reduce Japan\'s increasing trade surpluses with the U.S. And Europe, they said.  \n',trade
'Africa may have to follow Brazil in halting foreign debt payments unless industrialised nations are prepared to be more flexible in trade and economic policy, Ethiopian trade minister Tesfay Dinka said.     Growing protectionism and declining commodity prices had caused a major deterioration in the export earnings of all developing countries, he said in an opening speech to a meeting of African trade ministers in Addis Ababa.     Unless there was an early improvement in developing countries\' terms of trade \"the only choice is to follow the route that Brazil appears to have taken,\" Tesfay said.    The two-day meeting of delegates from 50 African states was called to work out a consensus ahead of the Group of 77 ministerial meeting in Havana next month, when the developing countries will debate their strategy in economic negotiations with the West.     Tesfay accused the West of intransigence in the negotiation of recent commodity agreements.     The failure of the International Coffee Organisation to agree on the reintroduction of export quotas would mean \"several African countries will not have the foreign exchange to import essential items,\" he said.     Coffee accounts for 60 pct of Ethiopian exports and the recent fall in world coffee prices has sharply reduced the country\'s foreign exchange earnings.     Adebayo Adedeji, the executive secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, told the meeting that there was an increasing net outflow of resources from Africa.     He blamed this on high interest rates, debt servicing and the repatriation of profits by foreign investors.     Africa paid 13 billion dlrs to service its total foreign debt last year and by 1990 annual service payments are expected to rise to between 16 and 24 billion, Adedeji said.     He accused industrialised countries of failing to provide more resources to implement the U.N. Program for Africa\'s economic recovery and development, despite Africa\'s willingness to raise two thirds of the capital from domestic sources.     The U.N. Program, approved last year, calls for 128 billion dlrs of economic investment in Africa over five years.     Western donors were asked to contribute 46 billion dlrs, with the rest being raised from local resources, but Adedeji said the donors had not responded as hoped.    In view of this poor response, he said \"it is possible that by the year 2,000 nearly all African countries, except a few, will be categorised as least developed countries.\"     At present, 27 of Africa\'s 50-odd states are officially listed in this category.  \n',trade
'Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest trade row between the United States and Japan.     Japan\'s huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe, as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold.     The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said.     But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting with the U.S. To do something about Japan\'s huge trade surplus.     \"The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the U.S.,\" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy Research Centre in London. \"Basically, their policies are pretty much the same.\"     But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically, Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said.     \"In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,\" he added. \"In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich.\"     Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington\'s tendency to impose so-called \"countervailing duties\" - an import tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair.     In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said.     In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade.     But the European Community has challenged the agreement as a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) practices that discriminates against its microchip producers.     \"It follows that they\'re not likely to rally to the side of the United States in defence of the agreement,\" said Wolf.     Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest of Europe told correspondents they would let the EC take the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row.     A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels tolds there has been no change in the Community\'s position since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances.     In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign ministers deplored Japan\'s continued trade imbalance and appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets.     EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC.     Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a trade war, they said.     Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits, cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to try to improve the situation, the diplomats said.     In Britain, where the government is angered over the difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said last week that retaliatory action is being considered.     But government officials said last night, \"We are not talking about days or weeks. This is going to take time.\"     They said the government would consider its options at a cabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions were expected. The main thing the British would threaten the Japan with is denial of access to London\'s booming financial markets, government officials said.  \n',trade

'The Reagan administration wants to encourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not believe Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said.     \"It seems to me that more trade between us is better than less trade,\" he told a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations.     To that end, the administration in January allowed foreign policy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the Soviet Union to lapse, he said.     Also, Washington and its allies are reviewing remaining export controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibited items and speeding up the licensing process, he said.     Whitehead said, however, the prefential treatment that comes with most-favored-nation status is out for the moment.     U.S. law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countries that restrict emigration and other rights.     \"What we have seen so far (in improved rights under Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev) are promising trends,\" he said.

'The ruling GATT Council deferred a decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.     David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.     The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips, officially known as semiconductors.     The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.     The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.     Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland, Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC complaint during the heated Council debate.

'A successful new GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.     Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, tolds bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.     \"That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round,\" he said. \"The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.\"     The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time.     The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said.     \"Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that\'s the basic objective of the new GATT round,\" he said.     But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.     \"It\'s a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,\" he said.     \"They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future,\" he said.  \n',trade
'The ruling GATT Council set up a formal dispute panel to examine a U.S. Complaint that a Canadian law prohibiting export of unprocessed herring and salmon was discriminatory.     David Wood, official spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing the decision was taken after bilateral consultations failed to resolve the row.     U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels charged during the Council debate that Canada was trying to preserve domestic jobs by insisting that herring and salmon be processed at home.     Robert White, Canada\'s deputy chief of delegation, replied the law was in line with GATT rules, and was for conservations reasons. But he agreed to setting up the dispute panel.  \n',trade
'Long term pressure by trade ministers is necessary if the current Uruguay round of talks on the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) is to succeed, New Zealand\'s Overseas Trade minister Mike Moore said.     Moore told the opening meeting of trade ministers from 22 nations gathered for informal talks on the GATT that ministers \"need opportunities to keep in touch and to consider how the political problems inherent in an exercise like this one can be faced and resolved.\"     Moore said the Taupo meeting is one of a series of such international gatherings, which includes the OECD ministerial meeting in May and the G-7 meeting in Venice in June, enabling ministers to maintain contact.

He said New Zealand is \"moving rapidly and of our own initiative in the direction of liberalisation, and I warn you we shall be looking for partners.\"  \n',trade
'The U.S. Will pursue its complaint that European governments unfairly subsidise the Airbus Industrie aircraft consortium in proceedings at the GATT civil aircraft committee, a GATT spokesman said today.     The U.S. Presented its case for the first time to the aircraft committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) during a special two-day session ending today. GATT rules cover some 80 pct of world commerce.     The 20-member committee agreed to open debate on the U.S. Complaint, starting with informal consultations and then holding a special session in July, trade officials said.     \"The tension has eased,\" the permanent trade ambassador of the 12-member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters. \"The U.S. Has decided to go through proper channels.\"     U.S. Trade officials again made clear their anger over what they call unfair government support for Airbus, voiced during a visit to European capitals in February.     In a letter calling for the special committee meeting, Washington charged France, West Germany, the U.K., Spain and the EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus.     The U.S. Charges that the Europeans are violating rules laid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.     Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines during the special session and asked the committee to confirm its view.     Official sources in the delegations said the U.S. Views would be considered during the informal consultations but the Europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against American civil aircraft practices.     Some delegates said the U.S. Position appeared to give such broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil aircraft accord needed re-negotiating. All these matters would be considered during the informal meetings.  \n',trade
'The United States\' emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country\'s real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.      By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual report.     The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt, it said.     GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years.     GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit.     Raising U.S. Trade barriers \"would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however, increase inflation and reduce world trade,\" it said.     \"The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain,\" the report said.     GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism.     The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.     The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.     \"Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year,\" the report said.     GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar.     \"Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in turn, would adversely affect world trade.\"     But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States, despite the dollar\'s depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive.     It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad.     World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986, about half of the rate of the previous year.     Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct, continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT said.     Developing countries\' exports declined significantly, while their imports increased moderately, although full statistics are not available yet, GATT said.     The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia, Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports.  \n',trade

'National Bank of Hungary first vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year\'s severe trade deficit with the West.     Fekete tolds in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade.     \"It is useful to have a devaluation,\" he said. \"There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports.\"     The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today. Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow.     He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5.5 pct in 1986).     This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s, he added.     Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year.     But the country\'s hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3 mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.     Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.     One Western commercial attache here said: \"Devaluation of itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods.\"     Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry.     It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market.     Hungary\'s net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen.     He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation.     \"I am for credits to invest for that purpose,\" he said. \"I am against credits for consumption.\" He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.    Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he considered rates to be low.     Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints.  \n',trade
'Amid new concerns about inflation, interest rate increases and trade confrontations, finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss a deteriorating global debt and economic situation.     The meetings, under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further, upsetting bond and stock markets.     Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new assistance.     Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works.     The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil, which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans.     Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to the very poorest states.     The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers in detail during next week\'s meetings and will undoubtedly be embraced by the developing countries.     \"There\'s interest on the part of some countries for looking at the support of the special problems of the very poorest countries, because their position is so extreme,\" a Reagan administration official said.     He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue.     The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor countries grow out of their problems.     The largest industrial countries have been attempting to coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other problems.     At the same time, the industrial countries see little evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct.     The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself,  continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other industrial countries to stimulate their economies.     These issues directly affect the debt problem and the ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their difficulties.     In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit, running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others to import more from developing countries.     The discussions, from April six to 10, will be wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the impact of development loans on the environment, according to monetary sources.     The talks will include an examination of trade protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on microchip products from Japan, the sources said.     The move accelerated the dollar\'s decline as financial markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing.     There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair market value and has kept its own market closed to imports, further undermining the international trading system.     At the same time, the ministers will discuss the fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export mainstay of many developing countries.     The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris, where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further.     The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for further debate on economic policy coordination.     As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America said it would reduce its federal budget deficit.     Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and economic policy changes in debtor nations.     Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more account of the environment when making loan for dams and other projects.     The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization plan for the Bank, now being prepared.  \n',trade
'India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange.     Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources tolds.     Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).     \"The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading.

Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country\'s large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.     The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year.     But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.     One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering.     The MMTC\'s recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.     \"MMTC\'s recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India,\" a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible.     \"We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India,\" the trade official said.     Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said.     Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.  \n',trade

'Indonesia cannot spend its way out of recession and has very limited economic options due to lower world oil prices, Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar was quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency.     \"If Indonesia spurs its economic growth too much, such as through expansionary monetary and budgetary policies, it might create negative effects not only on price increases, but also on the balance of payments,\" he told bankers and businessmen in the North Sumatran city of Medan.

To move towards increased deregulation of the economy,\" Conable told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Jakarta.     Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia\'s hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency.     The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted.     But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes.     \"The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government. We are not here to dictate to them,\" he stated.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly hit by last year\'s slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half.     Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto.     He voiced support for measures already taken, including September\'s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports.     \"The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today\'s world,\" he said.     The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year.     The World Bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce Indonesia\'s protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics and cement, western bankers and diplomats said.     The government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also considering selling off loss-making state companies.

'Japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17, industry analysts said.     The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks, the analysts said.     \"Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of the Japanese semiconductor industry,\" analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said.     But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far, and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run.     Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs.     \"We\'ve seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, and it has virtually dried up for EPROMS,\" said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers.     \"Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching,\" Kurlack added.     Industry analysts said Japan\'s Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year\'s semiconductor accord with the U.S.     The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the U.S. market.     But some analysts said Japan\'s attempt to mollify the U.S. was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S.     As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.     \"The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from Washington, but at the same time they\'re demonstating their muscle,\" analyst Peck said.     The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to benefit U.S. chip makers.     \"I think this could be a very important factor for U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,\" industry analyst Elliot Levine of Ladenburg Thalmann Co said.     But analyst Peck said, \"it will take a few weeks to see whether Japan has genuinely cut production.\"     He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI\'s request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in plant and equipment.   \n',trade

He said the high semiconductor prices recommended by the agreement were leaving Japanese manufacturers piling up stocks of unsellable products. \"We are aiming to reduce production in Japan but of course this takes time,\" he said.     The spokesman said some Japanese companies were selling chips in Europe and Asia below stipulated prices, but added: \"It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem.\"     The eight month old pact aims to stop Japan selling large quantities of chips at knock-down prices to the United States and other countries and to increase U.S. Semiconductor sales in Japan.

'Agriculture Ministry officials said they are not considering cuts in import duties on chocolate to help ease friction with the United States over agricultural trade.     Japan has already lowered the duties sharply and we must consider domestic market conditions, an official said.     Duties on chocolate were cut to 20 pct from 31.9 pct in April 1983.     Washington has been demanding a cut to seven pct, equivalent to its own duties, ministry sources said.     Japanese chocolate imports rose to 8,285 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 5,908 in 1985, official statistics show.     However, the ministry sources added it is possible the government may make further cuts in response to strong U.S. And European demand.     \"Due to concern about the farm trade row with the U.S., Top-level government officials may press the ministry to cut the duties,\" one said.     But he said it would be difficult for Japan to resolve its overall trade row with Washington and reduce its trade surplus, which reached 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986.     Agricultural trade issues between Japan and the U.S. Include Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products.  \n',trade

The long-term capital account deficit widened to 11.40 billion dlrs from 8.06 billion a year ago, but it narrowed from 12.32 billion in January, the Ministry said.     Japan\'s February exports rose to 16.74 billion dlrs from 14.89 billion in February 1986 and from 14.65 billion in January, the Ministry said. Imports fell to 8.61 billion from 10.12 billion a year earlier and 8.94 billion in January.     The invisible trade deficit fell to 617 mln dlrs in February from 693 mln a year earlier, but was up from a 527 mln deficit in January.     Figures do not tally exactly because of rounding.     Transfer payments narrowed to a 140 mln dlr deficit last month from a 185 mln deficit a year earlier and a 225 mln deficit in January.     The basic balance of payments deficit in February fell to 4.02 billion dlrs from 4.17 billion in February 1986 and 7.37 billion in January. Short-term capital account payments swung to a 1.28 billion dlr deficit in February from a 1.60 billion surplus a year earlier and a 1.44 billion dlr surplus in January.

'The Japanese government appears to have little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.     The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In retaliation for Japan\'s alleged failure to keep a pact on the microchip trade signed last September.     A Foreign Ministry official tolds \"Japan has done what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait for those steps to take effect.\"     The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S. Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.      Analysts noted Japan\'s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in third countries at non-regulated prices.     \"I\'m not sure MITI can do much more than it has,\" said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.     A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.     Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in imports was not likely.     Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be levied on consumer electronics products rather than on microchips themselves.     \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time, there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,\" said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.     \"The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be delayed for another year,\" he said.     Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.     \"The American approach is full of contradictions,\" Jardine Fleming\'s Edwards said.     \"If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that hurts the final market,\" Edwards said.     But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S. Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also frustration with Japan\'s vast trade surplus. Some analysts argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.     Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd, said \"The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic economy and move away from an export-dependent economy.\"  \n',trade
'Japan has launched a last-ditch effort to salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States - sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further.     \"We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,\" Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters.     \"If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will create very serious problems.\"     The Reagan Administration\'s Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors.     Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory action.     In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.     Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year.     He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so-called grey market.     \"We have almost no grey market,\" he said. \"Supply is diminishing.\"     To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI called in the president of Japan\'s largest semiconductor maker, NEC Corp NIPN.T last week, he said. It is also issuing specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary of Texas Instruments Inc.     Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for U.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers.     The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are expected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker Micron Technology Inc DRAM.O of cut-price Japanese sales in Hong Kong.     Yamamoto admitted that Oki Electric Industry Co\'s Hong Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices.     \"If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We will present our rebuttal,\" he said.     The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI\'s advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said.     He also called the case \"strange,\" but he stopped short of endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been trapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micron publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.  \n',trade
'Japan is becoming dangerously isolated again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth, officials and businessmen from around the world said.     As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen, making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.     The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.     The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation\'s lifestyle. There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation.\"     Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.     The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact.     British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture.     On Friday, European currency dealers said European central banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.     Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community. \"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report,\" he said.     \"We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demand...Would take time,\" Saito said.     Saito\'s words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I only know that your government, under the leadership of Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\"     And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And we hope to see changes occur in the near future,\" visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.     Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa\'s report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.     Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem.     \"We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,\" said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.     \"The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour,\" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers.     Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.     Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue.     He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and steel industries.     A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy. Europeans are confused about this, underlined by von Moltke\'s reference to the \"leadership\" of the Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last September\'s government programme of new economic measures. \"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report,\" the ambassador said.  \n',trade

'The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness.     A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters.     Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate, but those without it will not automatically be denied licences, he said.     But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak.     U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement.     Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement.     The MITI spokesman said, \"If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure.\"     MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.     But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. \"As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money,\" a Hitachi Ltd HIT.T spokesman said.  \n',trade
'Japan has agreed to drop barriers to American-caught herring and pollock, opening the way for shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced.     Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo.     He said the Commerce Department estimated U.S. shipments of processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later years.     There was no immediate assessment of the value of current U.S. shipments, but officials said the pact would lift quotas to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms.     At the same time, Yeutter said Washington was temporarily suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the two fish.

'Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, is still under way and will be completed sometime next month.     The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far, and they said Japan would comment on the final results.     A report from Washington yesterday said the study has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies. The study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries.     Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said. OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid-May.     One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy, and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said.     \"The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country, such as geography,\" the source said.     He said it is highly likely that the final study will show Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world.     \"This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan\'s farm market further, but this would have little impact on Japan\'s agriculture policy,\" he said, without giving further details.     A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations like the United States and the European Community, but Japan is a major importer, he said.  \n',trade
'Japanese officials sought to convince the U.S. That a U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead of an April 1 deadline set by the U.S. For them to prove their case.     \"We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact,\" Osamu Watanabe, Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry\'s (MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division, told foreign reporters.     \"The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place,\" he said.     U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States.     The agreement, signed last September, aimed at halting predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S. Semiconductor firms\' access to the Japanese market.     The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said.     Yukio Honda, director of MITI\'s Industrial Electronics Division, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries.     MITI\'s call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non-regulated grey market, Honda said.     \"The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, but in contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices,\" Honda said.     MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor exports to the United States, he added.     The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said.     Despite businessmen\'s ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls, regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results, Watanabe said. \"I am optimistic,\" he added.  \n',trade
'The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its semiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said.     The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price Japanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to take retaliatory action after April 1.     The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus.     MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has been pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export.     Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to reduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request, they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks of the first quarter.     If that reduced production level were maintained through to the end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct below that of the first three months of the year.     MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second quarter cutback.     One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there are picking up.     MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attempts to ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact.  \n',trade
'Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips from next month in line with government attempts to ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.     The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the sanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the plans, analysts said.     The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of products and are in retaliation for Japan\'s alleged failure to honour a semiconductor trade pact.     In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory pricing and open Japan\'s market to foreign products.     But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop the tariffs if Japan shows a \"clear indication\" that it will open its markets to U.S. Goods.     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the second quarter, following a call to reduce production by more than 20 pct the previous quarter.     MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports.     Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to cancel the tariffs ahead of next month\'s meeting between Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan.     \"The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword and shown that it can and will do business,\" said analyst Nick Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo.     But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can cut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal of the sanctions -- is more difficult.     \"The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC\'s (integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumer products. They\'re well supplied here,\" said Richard May, senior analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo.     The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC\'s, but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end production skills, the analysts said.     \"The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on semiconductors in return for free access to other areas,\" said Edwards.     A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd HIT.T, said the firm\'s reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory (256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI\'s efforts to ward off the trade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of the company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM\'s, he said.     Company officials unveiled the following plans -     - NEC Corp NESI.T, Japan\'s largest chipmaker, plans to slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last quarter.      In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chip imports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip consumption the year before.     - Hitachi Ltd\'s HIT.T April output of 256K DRAM\'s will fall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. The company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific target. Imports are currently very low.     - Toshiba Corp TSBA.T will reduce April 256K DRAM production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is considering ways to boost imports, a company official said.     Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sell the U.S. Firm\'s chips in Japan. The firms are planning a joint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern Japan.     - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim second quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln chips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased imports but an official said \"boosting imports will be difficult as it depends on sales demand.\"     - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord with MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels.     - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce April production by 10 pct from March\'s 3.2 mln. Oki is studying ways to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning April 1 from the previous year\'s total of more than five billion yen, a company official said.  \n',trade
'Japan\'s economic policies face fierce international attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its trade surplus, international monetary sources said.     At a meeting this week in Paris, senior government officials from major nations are considering an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) staff report that forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus, they said.     Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the yen\'s sharp rise against the dollar, they still tend to surge when growth picks up, according to the OECD.     As a solution, the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect its export-driven economy, boosting domestic demand and imports by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy, they said.     That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret meetings of the International Monetary Fund\'s executive board.     The monetary sources said Japan\'s policy was criticized when the board met to consider the country\'s economy under the annual consultations it holds with each of its members.     The United States, which until recently has been reluctant to criticize Japan\'s fiscal stance, joined in the attack, he said.     The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese government\'s forecast of 3.5 pct economic growth in the fiscal year beginning April 1. Most independent forecasters, including the IMF, believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below three pct, monetary sources said.     The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic pressure to boost an economy hard-hit by the yen\'s rise. The yen\'s climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge American market.     Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus, which last year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs.     Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said recently. The yen closed here today at 151.53 to the dollar. Most Japanese politicians, including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, are clearly hoping the yen will weaken, government officials said.     At a meeting in Paris last month, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the United States and West Germany, agreed to cooperate to hold currencies at around current levels.     Officials said that wording represented a compromise. Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few months, before it weakens later in the year.     Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value for the dollar, perhaps by substituting the word \"recent\" for \"current,\" while the United States wanted it to more clearly point to the dollar\'s weaker levels now, perhaps by use of the word \"present,\" they said.     In the months leading up the February 22 agreement, the dollar dropped some 10 yen.     The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the market that recent U.S. Action to prevent the dollar from rising above 1.87 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for the U.S. Currency.     Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts, which it says do not take account of the structural changes in the Japanese economy that will be triggered by the strong yen.     Officials said there are already signs of that. More and more companies have announced plans to move production facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad, they said.  \n',trade

The meeting was unveiled as part of a plan to boost imports and help head off protectionist legislation in the U.S.     Senior officials from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry told reporters that such personal appeals appeared to have paid off in the past, as Japanese imports of manufactured goods have climbed.     Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips next month in an attempt to help ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.     The officials also said they expect the government\'s new trade insurance law to boost imports and encourage Japanese companies to set up production facilities overseas.     Under the new law, the government will insure Japanese companies who pre-pay for imports against loss arising from everything from war to bankruptcy of the foreign firm they are dealing with. MITI estimated that it would help solve Japan\'s trade problem to the tune of about $10 billion dlrs a year.  \n',trade
'Japanese computer chip makers reacted angrily to news the United States plans to take retaliatory action against them for allegedly failing to live up to an agreement on trade in computer microchips.     Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) Chairman Shoichi Saba stated: \"EIAJ believes that it is premature and even irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of the agreement and our efforts to comply with it only six months after concluding the agreement.\"     \"We urge U.S. Governmental authorities to reconsider the decision made, to evaluate fairly the results of Japanese efforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement, and to resist emotional biases,\" he said.     Yesterday, Washington announced plans to slap as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation for what is sees as Japan\'s failure to comply with the terms of the pact.     The agreement, struck late last year after months of heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips on world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.     To salvage the pact, Tokyo has instructed its chip makers to slash production and has helped establish a multi-lateral organisation designed to promote chip imports.     Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged three mln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation and expressed regret that no American company has seen fit to join.     \"This suggests that American semiconductor manufacturers may not be really interested in participating in the Japanese market,\" he said.  \n',trade
'Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other.     The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz\'s one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.     Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.     \"We appreciate their frustration,\" a senior Japanese government official said. \"But we are also frustrated.\"     The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said.     He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress.     \"It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments,\" a senior U.S. Official replied.     The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan\'s favour.     On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers.     The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow\'s topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.     These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.     Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.     Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports.     Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. \"It condemns Japan without due process,\" one Japanese official said.     That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.     Japan is also not totally happy with the administration\'s trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said.     Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them.     \"We have no leverage,\" one official admitted.     As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers.     The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market.     The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said.  \n',trade

'Treasurer Paul Keating forecast economic growth at slightly under two pct in the financial year ending June this year, down from the 2.25 pct forecast contained in the 1986/87 budget delivered last August.     Australia\'s terms of trade also fell, by 18 pct, over the past two years, he told Parliament. Terms of trade are the difference between import and export price indexes.     Despite the figures, the budget forecast of about 1.75 pct annual growth in employment would be met, Keating said.     Unemployment is currently at 8.2 pct of the workforce.     \"This government is dragging Australia through a trading holocaust the kind of which we have not seen since the Second World War,\" Keating said.     \"We are not pushing this place into a recession.

'Australian Treasurer Paul Keating said he expects the country\'s 1986/87 current account deficit to be one billion dlrs lower than the 14.7 billion forecast in the August budget. Keating told a financiers\' dinner that February\'s 750 mln dlr deficit, against January\'s 1.23 billion, was \"in the groove\" of the government\'s expectations.     \"We will probably bring the current account this year under 14 billion, I think, which will probably be about a billion dollars less than we forecast in the budget,\" Keating said. \"I am sure we will see a lower current account deficit for next year ... And a fall as proportion of GDP.\"     Australia posted a 13.82 billion dlr current account deficit in 1985/86 and Keating said the latest monthly figures showed an encouraging trend.     Keating said the government would maintain responsible economic management regardless of whether it was drawn into an election, because it would take time to stabilise Australia\'s 80 billion dlr foreign debt.     \"We have to build the import competing sector back,\" he said. \"We are now trying to rebuild our capital structure. We are trying to rebuild the culture of productivity and manufacturing.\"     Keating said the foundation for a transition of the economy had been laid with the floating of the Australian dollar and continued with wage restraint and deregulation.     The Government would follow with spending cuts in its economic statement on May 14, he said.  \n',trade
'The House Ways and Means Committee completed action on legislation to toughen U.S. trade laws, chairman Dan Rostenkowski said.     The committee\'s consideration of one of the most controversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surplus countries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States, was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, its sponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said.     Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, tolds he was not certain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposal would take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10 pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries such as Japan.     The Ways and Means Committess\' trade bill forces President Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate international trade agreements but it allows him to wave retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S. economy.     The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions to grant domestic industries import relief.     It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade practices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These powers are currently held by President Reagan.     The administration has strongly objected to this transfer of authority from Reagan to Yeutter.     The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiate multilateral trade agreements. The bill will be wrapped into other trade legislation and voted on in the House in April.  \n',trade
'South Korea will further open its market to help cut its trade surplus with the U.S. And to fight off pressure to revalue the won against the dollar, a government spokesman said.     The spokesman said Korean trade minister Rha Woong-Bae\'s stand in Washington yesterday against pressure from industrial nations to revalue the won underlined the government\'s determination to stand firm.     Rha told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \"Demands that Korea carry out a drastic and sudden currency revaluation of five or 10 pct are, I believe, extremely ill-advised.\"     Deputy prime minister Kim Mahn-Je told a meeting of local businessmen \"The government\'s policy on the question of revaluing the won is to maintain a steadfast position.\"     Kim said South Korea was ready to move slowly to raise the won\'s value because of its heavy foreign debt which stood at 44.5 billion dlrs at the end of 1986.     Six industrialised nations agreed in Paris last month that newly industrialising countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, should allow their currencies to appreciate.     But local businessmen have said won/dollar parity has already reached \"a crisis level.\"     An official of the Korea Traders\' Association (KTA) said if the won strengthened another five pct, this would mean the loss of profitability for nearly half of all South Korean exporters.     \"We are determined not to go the way of Latin American debtor nations which have suspended interest payments of their debts,\" the spokesman said. \"The only way to keep our good record is to maintain our exports.+     The trade minister said yesterday should Seoul revalue the won suddenly Korea would run \"a tremendous trade deficit and could degenerate into a country, like many other developing countries, which is reneging on its international obligations.\"     The spokesman said South Korea had been gradually appreciating its currency, ruling out a major revaluation. So far this year, the won has gone up by 0.8 pct against the dollar after a 3.34 pct revaluation in 1986.     He said South Korea was selecting \"many\" of 122 items on which Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. No further details were given.     Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158 items, including sensitive agricultural products and large cars, effective from July.     South Korea posted its first ever current account surplus last year, due largely to a trade surplus with the U.S. Of 7.1 billion dlrs, against a 4.3 billion deficit in 1985. It earlier forecast that its current account surplus could reach eight billion dlrs this year.     But the government official said the surplus would be held at around five billion dlrs to avoid further pressure by industrialised nations to push up the value of its currency.  \n',trade

'A panel of four leading economists told a congressional hearing today that foreign economies will need to expand to avoid recession as the U.S. trade deficit declines.     C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury Department official, and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the major exporting countries risk recession if they do not expand because U.S. demand for imports is expected to fall.     \"They need to beef up domestic demand as their trade surplus falls,\" or unemployment will keep growing, Bergsten said.     Bergsten predicted the U.S. trade deficit, which hit 169 billion dlrs last year, will fall 30-40 billion dlrs a year for the next two years as a result of the dollar\'s 35-40 pct decline since September 1985.     The government should intervene to push the dollar down further if the previous declines do not lead to an improvement in the trade picture, if the U.S. budget deficit is not reduced and if foreign expansion does not occur, he added.     Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate for the huge interest payments required on U.S. foreign debt. The Paris agreement between the major industrialized countries provided only for a pause in its decline, he said.     Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., said the U.S. trade deficit problem is a problem of lagging growth in industrial economies, prolonged currency misalignment, debt problems of the developing countries, and unbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries.     John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, suggested foreign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack from the U.S. trade deficit fall.  \n',trade

'Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S. Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim.     Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S. President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said.     News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier.     It also came one day after the Reagan Administration\'s Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips.     Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one designed to pep up Japan\'s sagging economy and imports in the short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth.     But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day.     Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.     But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.     Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own measures.     He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the government\'s plans, without losing face in parliament over the budget, political analysts said.     Officials working on the government\'s short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.     They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first half, probably over 80 pct.     Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit.     To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japan\'s longer-term economic plans.     A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.     Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawa\'s report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy, officials said.     While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible, they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee\'s recommendations.     A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japan\'s total output, or gross national product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct of gnp.     The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993, from 150 now.  \n',trade

Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     \"We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system,\" he said.     \"We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all,\" Moore said.    \"The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000,\" he added.     The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the \"Uruguay round\" talks last September. The talks are  also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice.     The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round.     The southerners\' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met.     The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected.     Moore said one aim was to \"instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.\"     Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits, as well as preventing \"bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.\"     The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.     The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.

'Firms need not be pessimistic about export prospects even though foreign markets have become more difficult because of the mark\'s strength the Economics Ministry said.      The ministry\'s parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georg von Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports could start rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing the lower export trend which emerged in mid-1986.     But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be no need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of exports did not affect currently good domestic demand.     Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. \"This is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for stimulative steps,\" he said.     The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to work actively to promote free world trade, he added.     Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good export opportunities. Price alone was not the only factor in international competitiveness, he said, adding German firms have a reputation for high quality standards, prompt delivery times and good service.     Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficult position on its trade figures.  It faced international pressure to reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worried about the effect of the mark\'s strength on the country\'s exporters.     Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas, tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to a record 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise was due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the decline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports have in fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.  \n',trade
'Norway\'s parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.     The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway\'s minority Labour government, gives domestic companies until late September to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and Namibia.     \"The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an isolated measure, but as a step in an international process,\" Norway\'s foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament.     Government officials said they hope the move will intensify international pressure against the Pretoria regime\'s apartheid policies. Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to halt all trade with South Africa by October.     Norway\'s boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an important exception for ships whose final destination is decided while they are at sea.     Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading, making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships\' final port at the start of a voyage.     Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued oil shipments to South Africa. They called for stricter sanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa.     Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said.     The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure.     \"Many would say that the law has already had its effect because of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and Norway,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust tolds.     \"Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring its relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law.     \"No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on international trade with South Africa, but it is an important political statement by the Norwegian government,\" he said.     The Oslo government said it will review the effects of the ban on Norwegian industry after two years and may propose amendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law.     Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly to high-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it ferro-alloys and light metals industries.     Metals manufacturers estimate some 2,000 jobs could be affected by the boycott is suitable replacements for these ores are not found.     The legislation now goes on to the upper house for formal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said.  \n',trade

'The western industrialised nations have agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to subsidise export credits in so-called \"mixed credits,\" the OECD said.     The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for credits covering exports to the world\'s least developed nations.     Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD, which hosted the reform negotiations, said.     Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by July next year.     The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.     OECD officials said the agreement was based on a provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.     By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too costly for frequent use.     \"A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been closed today,\" a senior U.S. Official here commented.  \n',trade
'The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.     The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December.     It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year.     The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.     It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.     It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.     It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.     The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged.     It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year\'s 18.4 pct drop.     The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.     \"This is not a crash scenario but the dollar\'s steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing,\" the EIU said.     \"Talking will not stop the dollar\'s slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter U.S. Fiscal policy,\" it said.     It said the key to the dollar\'s fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.     \"Thus far they have been willing,\" the EIC said, adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would collapse.     To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis, it said.     On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look \"increasingly sick.\"     Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said.     The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December, the EIU said.     On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while Japan\'s exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar.     It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.     However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984, the EIU said.     After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.     It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6 pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986.  \n',trade

'Philippine Secretary of Trade and Industry Jose Concepcion, who two days ago expressed doubts about agreements produced at international conferences, said he was pleased with the latest gathering here.     Concepcion tolds in an interview that the informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.     \"Also, the role of the developing countries has been emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich countries,\" he added in an interview withs.     \"In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be of more benefit to the developed countries,\" he said.     Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the Uruguay round was meant to be a \"shining act of faith\" in the world trade system.     Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery to make it more responsive.     He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but faced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very high duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South Korea as examples.     He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New Zealand, which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines, to encourage it to switch imports from other countries. He noted that New Zealand bought its bananas from Ecuador.  \n',trade
'Philippines Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community (EC) imposed a levy on vegetable oils.     Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted.     He said the EC not only ignored Manila\'s request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but introduced a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries.     Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers, he noted that \"I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value.\"     He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services.     \"The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed,\" he said.  \n',trade

'President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States, White House officials said.     There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States, but officials said the move could come today or early next week.     Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan include tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors.     The sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal computers, television receivers and laser-printers, with the aim of penalizing Japan\'s major electronic firms, including NEC Corp, Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Fujitsu Ltd.     They said Reaan could also delay invoking sanctions for a week or two, giving Japan a final opportunity to end the dumping practice, but added that negotiators had already held extensive talks with the Japanese to no avail.  \n',trade
'House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.     In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.     But he warned that his \"conciliatory message\" on the trade bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn other countries their access to the American market would be curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.     \"Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,\" Rostenkowski said.     \"It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the American market,\" he added.     However, he said there would likely be changes in the market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.  \n',trade
'House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan\'s support.     He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget.     However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year\'s tax reform bill unchanged.     There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the 1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.     Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his 1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax increases.     On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry for special protection.     \"To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,\" he said.

They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month alleging South Korea\'s plan to import less from Japan and more from the U.S. And elsewhere was tantamount to creating non-tariff trade barriers.     South Korea unveiled the plan in November. It said it hoped to narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by 1991.

He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng.     He said Doumeng\'s Interagra company was preparing proposals for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of goods.     Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union\'s food production capacity.  \n',trade
'China\'s application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is seen as a test case by the Soviet Union, which will probably demand to follow China, a top European Community official said.     Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of the European Communities, told a news conference that China\'s application would involve long and difficult negotiations.     China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and in February presented a memorandum backing its application, which De Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then be presented to China.     \"After China, other important state-trading countries including the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession. China\'s application could be considered a test case,\" he said.     He said the EC strongly backed China\'s application, but others among GATT\'s 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.     Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economy entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and the expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy without trade discrimination, de Clercq added.     De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two current Socialist GATT members.     On China\'s import potential, he said a foreign exchange shortage would force China to import less this year and next than in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipment and capital.     During his visit, De Clercq has met top Chinese leaders and today signed an agreement to open a European Community Commission office in Peking.  \n',trade
'Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European Community levels, director-general of the INFE export institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.     \"The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now,\" he said.      \"This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy, which have a similar productive structure,\" he said.     The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain\'s presence in international trade fairs.     Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted.     Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20 billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the government\'s development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant.     The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.     Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand, which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.     He added that 80 pct of Spain\'s exports went to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries.     The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.     \"The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of EC competition,\" he said.     He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while turning their backs on foreign markets.     \"They have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation,\" he said. \"Foreign companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and it is it vital to secure a market share abroad.\"  \n',trade
'Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president\'s council of economic advisors, said stronger domestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to help stimulate U.S. exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines.     \"Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of U.S. export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation,\" he told the Futures Industry Association.     Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war period.     \"Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery,\" he said.     Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners, he said recent figures showed Japan\'s economy grew by about 0.5 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, \"Not enough to sustain employment growth.\"     However, Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies, including tax reform. \"I suspect there will be further moves,\" he said.     Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U.S. government spending and for resistance to tax increases.     \"Reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform,\" he said, adding that \"a vote to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax reform.\"     Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored U.S. cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the U.S. trade balance appeared to have abated.     However, he said that \"sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable,\" as it risks inflation in the United States and recession abroad.     \"I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987,\" he said. Improvements in the U.S. trade balance, he said, will come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and present \"serious adjustment problems for U.S. trading partners.\"     Western Europe, where manufactures output and employment have been weak, promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the U.S. trade balance, Sprinkel said.     He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them.  \n',trade
'A free trade pact between the United States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially, according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics.     The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada\'s gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S. export\'s by about seven pct.     He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.     The United States and Canada - the world\'s two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150 billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They are aiming for a pact by next October.     Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of Maryland, said an agreement should include:     - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased in over a five to 10-year period;     - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries, replacing current \"Buy America\" and \"Buy Canada\" provisions with a \"Buy North America\" provision;     - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance and transportation;     - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers;     - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.      Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to 2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.     The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.     He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage.     Wonnacott said \"bilateral free trade would contribute to the efficiency of the North American economies and to their competitiveness in facing overseas producers.     He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass production.     Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to Canada proportionately, he said, because of the already large U.S. gross national product.     Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areas as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write new and more liberal global trading regulations.  \n',trade
'Sweden announced its promised program of unilateral economic sanctions against South Africa and gave firms an October deadline to cut trading links.     Foreign Trade Minister Anita Gradin said a trade boycott of South Africa and neighbouring Namibia would take effect from July 1, followed by a three-month period of grace to give companies time to wind down their operations.     From October 1, no direct trade would be allowed in either direction, with certain exceptions covering medical supplies and printed matter, Gradin told a news conference.     She said exceptions would also be granted in cases where a Swedish trade boycott would benefit South African firms and disadvantage South Africa\'s black-ruled neighbours, the front-line states.

Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development, tolds Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second half of this year.     Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.     \"We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially,\" he said.     The United States, Taiwan\'s main trading partner, has said the island\'s import tariffs, still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as too selective.      Taiwan\'s trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.     Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan\'s position in talks with Washington over export quotas, particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are among the island\'s main export-earners.

'Canada\'s decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policy study group said      \"It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period, when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world,\" the Washington-based Atlantic Council said.     U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries, the world\'s biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually.     The council\'s study said the trade talks, with a deadline of October for an agreement, are the biggest issue in U.S.-Canadian relations.    The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties.     The council said \"in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population.\"     But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world.     The council said that in the talks, Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against  allegedly subsidized exports.     A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized.     The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending curbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and the so-called \"cultural industries\" - publishing, broadcasting and films.

'Tense trade relations with the U.S. And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed European Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here tomorrow.     EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the EC Executive Commission\'s proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations.     The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform package, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this month, of the EC\'s Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as the root cause of the EC\'s persistent financial problems and of tensions with major trading partners.     The proposal is described by its promoters as a stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut cereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward tax.     They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by a fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two billion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm costs.     It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as well as foreign exporters, led by the United States.     The diplomats said the protests had been received from most corners of the developing and developed world, ranging from Senegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Iceland and Norway.     The proposal had little chance of approval by EC governments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as Britain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.     Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and Greece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to the list of products affected.     But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S. And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote anti-EC action, and the foreign ministers\' debate should demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument.     The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the U.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a bill that would curb EC textile exports.     The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, if enacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation.  \n',trade

On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo\'s alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.     That agreement, reached last year after heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.     Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s planned trip to Washington at the end of April.     While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip\'s success, they said.     \"The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,\" one official tolds. \"We would very much like to do something to respond to that.\"     In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government.

They said that it was an open secret that Japan\'s largest chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact, included enforced production cuts.     The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action.     \"Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the U.S./Japan agreement,\" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan.     He accused the U.S. of being \"irrational.\" He said the U.S. action had made the bilateral chip pact \"meaningless.\"     Saba\'s comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations.     Japan is expected to send a high-level official to Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to go ahead with the tariffs on April 17.

'Japan is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale trade war, government officials said.     \"We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won\'t have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States,\" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said.      On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo\'s alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.     That agreement, reached last year after heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.     Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s planned trip to Washington at the end of April.     While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip\'s success, they said.     \"The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,\" one official tolds. \"We would very much like to do something to respond to that.\"     In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government.     Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute, trade analysts said.     They said that it was an open secret that Japan\'s largest chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact, included enforced production cuts.

'The House Ways and Means Committee is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws.     The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign unfair trade practices against other domestic industries.     The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge.     The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be approved.      In investigations involving a processed agricultural product, trade associations of processors or producers would have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair duties.      The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture, seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and non-tariff barriers.      President Reagan\'s authority to negotiate a new GATT agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended through January 3, 1991.     The bill extends Reagan\'s authority to negotiate an international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.     It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur before Octoer 1, 1991.     Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be processed within three years after import and exported within five years.     Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from imports.  \n',trade
'Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen\'s renewed rapid rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States, political analysts said.     Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), they said.     \"The close relationship between Nakasone and President Reagan was an important element of Nakasone\'s power base,\" Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida tolds. \"So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages Nakasone.\"     Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax.     \"Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from Nakasone,\" Uchida said. \"His position within the LDP itself is not so strongly established today.\"     Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support eroded, the analysts said.     The yen\'s rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in retaliation for Japan\'s alleged violation of a microchip trade pact are now giving Nakasone\'s critics fresh ammunition, the analysts said.     \"Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and Nakasone hasn\'t worked effectively,\" Rei Shiratori, director of the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said.     This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone\'s credibility, Shiratori tolds.     The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen\'s rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said.     \"If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to resign early,\" Shiratori said.     But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29, some analysts said.     However, \"unless the Japanese political system can move more quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very hostile audience,\" said Merrill Lynch Securities economist William Sterling.     \"If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the final nail in his coffin,\" he said.     Reagan\'s own weakened domestic position, and growing Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts said.     But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid Nakasone, they said.     \"One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave,\" Sterling said.  \n',trade
'U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April.     In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices.     The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year\'s record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.     Generally, the bill\'s provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws.     The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products in the United States at prices below cost of production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence.     In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.     Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products.     But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties Reagan\'s hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers.     Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee\'s bill was not one \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\" but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse.     The goal of trade legislation was \"to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements,\" he said.     In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.     It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy.     Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.     Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill\'s provisions, but he added, \"Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well.\"     The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S.     The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation.     Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.     AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress.

I\'m trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president.\"     Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year.     House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.  \n',trade

'Japan today announced another mammoth monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action.     \"The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not moving more quickly,\" Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economist Eric Rasmussen said.     The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus soared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion in January and 4.77 billion a year ago.     The current account surplus, which includes trade in services as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs last month from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago.     After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figures look a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the trade surplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs from a record 9.58 billion in January.     \"In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off further protectionism or further yen strength,\" said William Stirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.     A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on world markets while making imports into the country cheaper.     \"On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making some progress on getting exports down,\" Jardine\'s Rasmussen said.     But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the Japanese economy remains sluggish, he said.     Finance Ministry officials blamed last month\'s slower import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked off stocks they had built up in January.     The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of exports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increase in January.     This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen against the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact on exports, they said.     But economists warned that may not be soon enough for Japan\'s trading partners.  \n',trade
'The threatened trade war between the United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin.     But they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip, or whether this week\'s falling share prices mark the start of a \"bear\" market.     \"It\'s the billion dollar question,\" said Richard O\'Brien, economist at American Express International Bank in London.     Japan\'s trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods, may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit.    And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S. Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O\'Brien said. The subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets.     \"A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,\" said O\'Brien. \"Now, it is much less certain.\"     Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O\'Brien.     Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith Barney Harris Upham said  \"We\'re still in a bull market,\" adding that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and \"The bear usually strikes slowly.\"     Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in London, said the huge sums of money going through the world financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.     Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it\'s very difficult to see where else they can put their money than in U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market, according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd\'s bond operation in London.

In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and the dollar\'s slide will mean for securities markets.  \n',trade

'Britain and West Germany told their European Community partners they would strongly oppose major elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses.     At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for a full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led protests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said.     West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, will advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance other proposals that could hit German farmers, they added.     They said West Germany\'s objections were put in a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, the president of the EC\'s Executive Commission which had put forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC cash crisis.     Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) - a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports.     Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German farmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult to export to weaker currency states, which means virtually all other 11 EC states, diplomats said.     Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it could seriously damage EC trade relations.     The diplomats said the United States had been the most outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing it as a breach of the EC\'s obligations under the world trade body GATT.     But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC, such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, Iceland and Norway, they added.     Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that could spark a damaging trade war with the U.S.     Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today, diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear that neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this month, they added.  \n',trade
'Export Credits Guarantee Department has named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay\'s Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17 years, to the post of executive director, a department spokesman said.     Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.     A drop in the ECGD\'s business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years.     Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern, adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services.

Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.     The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis, he said. \"Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at.\"     \"You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,\" Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients.

'Britain had a visible trade deficit of 2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official statistics show.     Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third quarter shortfall of 930 mln.     For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3 billion stg, sharply up from 1985\'s 2.2. Billion shortfall and a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.     Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday.     The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to 1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion.     In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.     The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO said.     However, 1986\'s surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade increased by 2.1 billion.     The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.     The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions, particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to substantial revisions as later information becomes available.  \n',trade

'The release of U.K. February trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.

Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.     Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.     However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the Chancellor\'s Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture on imported goods.     However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.     He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry.     The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if January\'s bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres, Harwood said.     U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2 point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries about the figures evaporated.     Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1.5960.     However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.     Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government\'s support was slipping.     The Marplan poll, published in \"Today,\" showed Conservative support had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31 pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party, whose own support fell from 38 pct.     The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent, political observers said.     Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn that today\'s improved sentiment could be dented if support for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.     This upsetting of the markets\' political perceptions, which are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data, Harwood said. \"The news did come as a very, very substantial relief,\" he said.     However, on the interest rate front, economists caution that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed.  \n',trade
'Britain\'s visible trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department said.     The current account balance of payments in February showed a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January.     Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln surplus, the same as in January.     Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January.     Trade Department officials said the improvement in Britain\'s current account contrasted with most private forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been expected.     The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January reduced exports that month and that there had been an element of catching up in the February figures.     The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from 114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5.     The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751 mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425 mln from 352 mln.  \n',trade
'The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said.     The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by Congress.     Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito.     Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S. Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.     He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three, the spokesman said.     Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S. Complaints about Japan\'s agricultural policy.  \n',trade
'The United States has appealed for stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to enforce world trade rules.     The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by the 93-nation body to promote fair trade.     Today\'s meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers 13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and services will take four years to negotiate.     Smith called for boosting GATT\'s links with financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round.     \"The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the world trading system and the global economy,\" Smith said.     \"Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak, or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy.\"     He also also urged that member states be accountable to each other for their trade policies.     Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European Community (EC) officials, tolds the committee wanted to stress GATT\'s importance and did not discuss specifics.     \"We are interested in more periodic ministerial involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings,\" he said.     GATT\'s ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the 12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute panel be set up to review the agreement.     President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay trade round to promote freer trade, has said Washington will impose tariffs against Japanese electronic goods.     He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets to U.S. Exports.  \n',trade
'The Semiconductor Industry Association urged the U.S. government to impose trade sanctions against Japan for violating the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement.     In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as of April 1 and continue until the U.S. is satisfied there is full compliance with the agreement.     The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor exports is not what is required.     \"America\'s interests require that agreements be honored and that U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to deliver on its commitments,\" the trade group said.     The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled for Thursday.     The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to foreign-based manufacturers.  \n',trade
'The U.S. House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open foreign markets to more U.S. goods.     The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means Committee next week, but major changes are not expected, congressional sources said.     \"This product could very well be toughening our trade policy and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this frightening word \'protectionism\',\" Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.     The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.     But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.     Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House approved his idea to force an annual 10 pct trade surplus cut by those countries.  \n',trade
'The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now kept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a threat to U.S. national security.     The Democratic-controlled committee said the administration\'s export control policies, which restrict shipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year\'s record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit.     The committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries.     Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic Policy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year.     \"This is Congress\' number one opportunity to attack the trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more,\" the Washington Democrat said.     The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls.     Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments.     It would also give the Commerce Department primary authority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit the Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing requests to export highly-sensitive technology.  \n',trade
'House trade lawmakers took their first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on controversial plans to protect American industries.     Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United States.     The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year\'s effort to force President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs.     Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific trade penalties.     The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it.     Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking his party\'s 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods.     This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances.     \"My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the trade deficit down,\" he told reporters.     The trade law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more competitive.     House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill.     \"I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective bill,\" he told reporters.     The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and to improve education and worker training.     The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S. industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining, safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the country\'s economic development.     They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and whether an injured industry deserves import relief.     They agreed to make it easier for a company to get temporary relief from import competition but agreed the industry should provide a plan to become competitive.     The administration has not announced its support but Yeutter said yesterday, \"I am cautiously optimistic,\" that the Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill.  \n',trade
'A key House panel voted to greatly ease government controls on exports as several House committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes.     The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no longer considered important to U.S. military security.     Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S. companies could not sell abroad.     The issue has been the subject of administration debate. The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current controls should be retained but better administered.     Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices.     Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full House in late April.     Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling interest in Schlumberger Ltd\'s Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to expand Reagan\'s authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies.     Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests.     \"We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security,\" subcommittee chairman James Florio, a New Jersey Democrat said.     The subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive government procurement practices.     The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction.     At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese product--digital audio recorders.     Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S. telecommunications products.      Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S. companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and patent laws.                                            \n',trade
'The U.S. Is willing to drop tariffs on Japanese electronic imports if Japan shows it will abide by an agreemement opening its markets to American goods, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a TV interview.     \"But there has to be a clear indication that they are willing to act,\" he said.     Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused by the U.S. Tariffs and the yen\'s rise against the dollar are problems \"they have brought on themselves.\"     The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today.     \"Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economic turmoil in Japan,\" he said. \"My only response is that we have gone through about five years with the dollar going in just the opposite direction. Although I can sympathise, it\'s occurred for only a few weeks or months in Japan.\"     The tarriffs, announced on Friday by President Reagan, will affect about 300 million dlrs worth of products, only a tiny fraction of Japan\'s total exports to the U.S.     Even so, Reagan\'s decision \"doesn\'t give us any joy. We don\'t want to take retaliatory action here if we don\'t have to,\" Yeutter said.     Yeutter said the meetings scheduled next month in Washington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will include \"some difficult items on the agenda.\"     Japan has failed to implement two parts of a three-part semiconductor agreement, Yeutter said.     Japan has stopped dumping chips in the U.S. But it has failed to open its domestic markets to U.S.-made chips and has failed to end predatory pricing in Third World countries, undercutting U.S. Products, he said.  \n',trade

'Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost will visit Tokyo next week for meetings with high-level officials that will include talks on the growing trade row over Japanese semiconductor electronics products.

Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the trip is set for April 6 to 8.     U.S.-Japanese talks of this kind are regularly held each year at this time, she told reporters.     The Armacost discussions with Deputy Foreign Minister Ryohei Murata and other senior Japanese officials will focus on U.S.-Japanese foreign aid programs and political security issues of mutual concern, she added.     \"Although an exchange of views on bilateral relations is expected, the talks are not directly related to U.S.-Japanese trade relations,\" she insisted.     But, in response to questions, Oakley acknowledged that trade will be discussed.

'The dollar will decline over the next two to three years, but this is unlikely to result in a complete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, said Anthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.     In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon said without elaboration that he expects a \"significant decline in the dollar,\" within the next three years.     \"The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficit will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,\" he said.     Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited several factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit.     For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.     In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes.     Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but said it could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil prices are stable and commodity values remain low.  \n',trade
'The U.S. Expects more harmonious talks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac\'s first official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes between the two countries begin to fade.     \"The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade war didn\'t happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation on terrorism,\" one U.S. Official tolds.     \"It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect, more harmonious than usual.\"     Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the United States.     During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in Libya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S. Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a circuitous route. That angered Washington.     The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong enough action against terrorism. \"Now they are. We\'re pleased and they are pleased that we are pleased,\" one said.     More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European Community  threatened to become a trade war.     In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.     Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad, supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases in northern Chad.     A French official added: \"There is also a common interest in getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the world by opening up its markets.\"     Although relations have improved markedly between the two countries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the Community\'s common agricultural policy (CAP).     To Washington, as one official put it, \"CAP is the root of all evil\" in international food trade because it subsidises farmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world prices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.  \n',trade

'The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee approved a bill that would establish farm trade and aid missions to promote the use of U.S. food aid, donation, credit and export subsidy programs by overseas customers.     The bill, approved by voice vote, would establish trade missions made up of representatives of the Departments of Agriculture and State, the Agency for International Development, the Overseas Private Investment Corp, market development cooperatives and private voluntary organizations.     At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one year after enactment of the bill. The missions would promote U.S. programs, including PL480, Section 416 donations, Export Enhancement Program, the dairy export incentive program, and export credit guarantee programs (GSM-102, GSM-103).     The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill, offered by Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), that would have required the U.S. Agriculture Department to donate at least one mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries.     Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750,000 tonnes of surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 food donation program.     The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up to 50 mln dlrs per year, Senate staff said.     The committee also dropped a provision identifying which countries would be the focus of the trade missions\' activities.     Under the bill adopted by the committee, countries \"friendly to the United States\" would be eligible to host the trade missions.     Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico, the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Nigeria, Peru, Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco.

'The chairman of the U.S. Senate committee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concerned about a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted by the Canadian House of Commons last week.     The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading agreement with the United States while protecting Canadian political sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketing systems, the auto industry and Canada\'s cultural identity.     Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free trade agreement between the two countries, which are each other\'s largest trading partners.     \"We need a truly free trade agreement, which means both countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually beneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement,\" the Texas Democrat said in a statement.     \"I do not question Canada\'s right to protect its political sovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrases mean the government of Canada means to take important economic issues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeply concerned,\" he added.     Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways while the United States uses only six trade restriction methods. He said if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries get rid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fair and might not win Senate approval.     \"I am deeply concerned that when the President visits Prime Minister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented with this kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear -- as I did when I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficial agreement will be successful,\" Bentsen said.

'The United States will likely impose sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators said today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige.     Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision would be taken until a final determination is made on whether Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they said they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties.     President Reagan\'s trade policy advisory group, of which Baldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday.     \"I am confident we will see action taken,\" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, told reporters.     \"I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more than sanctions,\" Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said.     The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department officials to discuss Japan\'s alleged violations of a September 1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United States and other countries.     They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for continuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100 mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said.     Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen. Pete Wilson told reporters, \"The clear import of what he said is that there will be.\"     \"Japan can\'t just say they will comply. We think sanctions must be applied,\" for past violations of the agreement, the California Republican said.     The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips which are used in high technology products ranging from radios to defence missile guidance systems.     Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige told them the administration had not made a final determination that Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below the cost of production in the United States or other countries.     But McClure said senators told him, \"There is no doubt dumping is going on,\" based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the Japanese products.     The two countries signed a pact last September in which Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United States and other countries below production costs and to allow the U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market.     In return, the United States waived its right to impose import duties on the Japanese microchips.     Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact and have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to save the pact.     Japan has frequently been the target of congressional discouragement over last year\'s record 169-billion-dlr trade deficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United States last year and had large surpluses with other countries.     The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution calling for action against Japan for violations of the pact since September. The resolution will be introduced in the House next week by Rep.

Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies to recoup export markets lost to competing nations\' unfair trading practices.     Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be eligible for the subsidies, sources said.

The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), would clarify the definition of \"industry\" in determining whether or not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers.     Grassley\'s bill stems from a 1985 decision by the International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live swine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harming U.S. producers.

Speaking to reporters prior to testifying at a House Agriculture Committee hearing, Yeutter said it is \"difficult to comprehend\" that a trade decision affecting only 300 mln dlrs in goods caused the stock market collapse yesterday.     \"I have a hunch a lot of other things were involved in that (stock market fall), including simple profit-taking,\" Yeutter said.     Yeutter said Japan would be sending a senior official from its trade ministry to Washington next week for talks on the computer chip dispute.     \"We will be glad to have him here, but that\'s not going to affect a decision that\'s already been made,\" Yeutter said.     The decision announced last week would apply higher tariffs on a range of Japanese products in retaliation for the alleged failure of Tokyo to honor an agreement with the U.S. on semiconductor trade.  \n',trade
'U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to reduce its large trade surplus with the United States.     \"Our central message to Japan this week was that while we have made progress in some areas, much needs to be done,\" he told a press conference after three days of talks.     \"What we need is a resolution of trade issues, we need visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more imports and we need greater domestic-led growth.\"     Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year, Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce its trade surplus, which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986.     He named several areas of particular concern to Washington -- computer microchips, supercomputers, Kansai airport, agricultural products and car telephones.     He warned that the U.S./Japan agreement governing trade in semiconductors was in jeopardy. Despite the pact, Japanese producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other than the United States while U.S. Penetration of the Japanese market has not increased, he said.  \n',trade
'A high level U.S. trade official said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor electronics products.     Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliate against U.S. exports, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce Smart replied, \"That would be the height of foolishness.\"     In addition, he doubted Japan could show enough progress in meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual imposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17.     Japan\'s 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986.     President Reagan\'s sanctions decision won praise today from the two Democratic leaders of Congress.     \"I think it\'s about time,\" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House session, \"It just shows we were right all along when we said something needs doing.\"     Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing that last Friday\'s U.S. trade action would help U.S. negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts.     Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up Japan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Last year, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States in these products.     Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987.     \"It\'s amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. I hope it will persuade them we\'re serious,\" Smart said of the White House trade sanctions.     The United States has tried to convince Japanese car companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers.     \"All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading them we can do better than our reputation seems to be,\" he said.     Measured per car, each American-made car contained about 700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car contained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said.  \n',trade
'U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said an agreement has been reached by members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to control the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promote trade.     He said in a statement the agreement culminates the Reagan administration\'s effot to negotiate a virtual end to export credit subsidies.     The practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed credits to promote exports has cost the United States lost jobs and lost exports, the Treasury said.     The agreement to be implemented in two stages by July, 1988 would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries and place limits on permitted aid by developing countries.     It would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor countries, the Treasury said.     Baker said the agreement imposes particular sacrifices on Japan and praised Japan\'s willingness to accept the pact as a demonstration of the Japanese government\'s willingness to take concrete steps to resolve important trade issues.  \n',trade
'U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said that he opposes a Federal tax increase to help reduce the budget deficit and favors spending cuts instead.     \"I don\'t think it\'s (a tax increase) is a very good idea and I\'m quite confident that President Reagan doesn\'t think it\'s a very good idea,\" Baker said in an interview on Cable News Network\'s \"Moneyline\" television program.     He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP which is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker said spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.     Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes.     \"The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate approach to take,\" the Treasury Secretary said. He said the United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in the world and new taxes would impair efficiency.     On the international front, Baker said banks must do more lending to developing countries. He was questioned about this after the Standard and Poor\'s Corp downgrading today of the debt of six major money center bank holding companies, largely because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure.     Baker said that developing countries must adopt free market economic policies such as in the United States. He said capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the economic systems of those countries.     The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker said that developing nations\' \"investment regimes do not support enough equity investment, so you\'ve got to have some debt there.\"     Commenting on the U.S. trade deficit, Baker said \"I think you\'re going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction this year.\"  \n',trade

It has been successful and continues to be succesfull,\" a senior U.S. Treasury official told reporters.     In a briefing ahead of this week\'s semiannual IMF and World Bank meetings, he also said the U.S. was looking to West Germany and Japan to bolster their economic growth.     The official said both surplus countries, like West Germany and Japan, and deficit countries, like the U.S., agreed to play a role in bringing about more balanced economic growth.     He reaffirmed the U.S. would press ahead with efforts to reduce its budget deficit, resist protectionism and boost U.S. competitiveness.     The official also said that he expected trade issues, like the dispute between the U.S. and Japan over microchips, to be included in the discussions.     The official made no direct comment on the content or schedule of forthcoming Group of Five and Group of Seven discussions. He said that industrial countries are concerned that the large external imbalances remain a threat to the international monetary system.     He added that the meetings will also provide an opportunity to discuss economic policy coordination efforts.     The official said indicators would be used to measure policy objectives of industrial countries and their economic projections.     They would also be used to assess progress of policy goals.     Asked whether the U.S. was proposing a new initiative regarding the indicators, the official said the issue would be reported to the Venice Summit in June.

'U.S. and Japanese officials meet tomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor trade and to cut short the 300 mln dlr penalty tariffs President Reagan has ordered imposed on Japanese exports.     But U.S. officials held out little hope that any accord could be reached before the tariffs of 100 per cent - up from about five per cent - are to take effect on April 17.     The Customs Bureau last week started to levy a bond on the Japanese goods that Reagan ordered penalized. The penalties would be retroactive to March 31.     Reagan said on March 27 when ordering the tariffs that he hoped the Japanese would soon end their unfair practices in semiconductor trade and that sanctions could be lifted.     Technical meetings are to be held today and tomorrow, with meetings at a more senior level scheduled for Thursday and Friday. Public hearings on the sanctions are set for April 13.

'The British government may revoke the licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London\'s financial City when they come up for renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up Japan\'s markets to foreign competition, government sources said.     \"We can\'t say \"yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)\" but this is definitely being considered,\" an official said.     His comments came after the government was formally urged today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint retaliatory action with the United States against Japan.     Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese trade practices. \"There\'s a sense of urgency here now, but the emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in Japan,\" another government official tolds.     Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access.     She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said.     The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7 billion stg, official figures show.     A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged the U.K. Government to \"coordinate action with the President of the United States, and through the Department of Trade and Industry, to suspend all further applications from Japanese communications companies for equipment approval by the British Approvals Board for Telecommunications, and all further applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences\" until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called \"restrictive conditions\" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC) (cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in Japan\'s international telecommunications market.     The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section of MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament. Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on the Conservative government to take firm action.     Officials said another option now being considered by the U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese institutions. That could be done under the government\'s proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.     58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.     The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied under legally-binding international trade agreements.     \"The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in investment, banking and insurance,\" one official said.     \"This point has been made to the Japanese at official level a number times,\" the official added.     Britain and France are now working together to urge that the European Community take collective action against Japan, but by working within EC treaties, another official said.     British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio interview that the European Community should build barriers against Japanese imports through certification procedures similar to those facing European exporters in Japan.     \"There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer,\" he said, adding \"(such barriers) can\'t be put in place overnight.\" Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade \"strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness.\"     The situation is only likely to worsen following news that Japan\'s trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.     But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.     Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global business centre, government sources said. Japan\'s four largest securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.     In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.     There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the move could come today or early next week.     Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors.    \n',trade

Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in solving the row over a U.K. firm\'s bid to win a significant role in Japan\'s telecommunications market, government sources said.     Tensions have risen following Britain\'s decision to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain Japanese financial institutions.     Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc, government officials said.     But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo that Nakasone\'s assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of British anger, they added.  \n',trade

The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to end selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to forego antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.     But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.     Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action, ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to force prices up and end the dumping.     Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the U.S. industory more competitive.     But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to pass and that action was required now to help the depressed electronic industry.

Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Yeutter said \"Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now.     \"Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the trade deficit down.\"     He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits.     Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S. budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser extent, other U.S. securities as well.     \"We\'ll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987, but there\'s still a long way to go,\" Yeutter said.     He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and the establishment of a \"level playing field\" for trade.     The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down.     On the fiscal side, Yeutter said \"the budget deficit is still our biggest problem\" and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit.     In the international area, he said that \"our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth.\" Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said \"Japan is just not doing the job on the import side.\"     Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner.     In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.     \"The market will determine the dollar\'s proper value in the end,\" Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S. trade deficit, \"the dollar will be the equalizer.\"     Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers.     He said \"there\'s relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem.\"     Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said.     \"There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation,\" Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems.  \n',trade
'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining U.S.-Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April.     \"We are having high level discussions on them (the issues) within the United States...The relationship on some of those is very strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date,\" he said.     \"I am not sure we can wait until late April,\" he added.     Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT).     He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries.     Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors, Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy U.S. Super-computers and the barring of U.S. Firms from the eight billion U.S. Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka.     The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country.     \"I am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction. The question is how far and how fast,\" Yeutter said.  \n',trade
'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).     Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture.     Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.     Yeutter said \"at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.\"     There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and \"a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there,\" Yeutter said.     However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.     \"It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy,\" he said.     He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he said.     Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process, but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.     It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources, he said.     Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations, he said \"one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it\'s going to have to be as part of a larger package.\"  \n',trade
'The United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade, especially over semiconductors, Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U.S. Super-computers, and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.     He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks.     European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world\'s three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT.     Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes.     New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts.     Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. \"Countries don\'t get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future.\"     He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. \"That\'s a very healthy development,\" he added.\"If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist.\"     \"Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit,\" Yeutter said.     \"They\'ve also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago.\"     He added, \"Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter.\"  \n',trade
'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter stressed the importance of trade negotiations to open foreign markets rather than trade restrictions in a statement to the Senate Finance Committee.     \"In the long term we cannot repeatedly bludgeon other nations into opening their markets with threats of U.S. restrictions. Rather, we must be able to negotiate credibly for global liberalization,\" Yeutter said.     Yeutter did not mention the recent U.S. trade sanctions against Japanese semiconductors in his testimony on the pending trade bill.     Yeutter said the trade bill should increase U.S. competitiveness, aid U.S. trade negotiating leverage, and avoid provoking foreign retaliation.     He urged Congress to reject provisions that would mandate U.S. retaliation against foreign unfair trade practices.     Yeutter emphasized the importance of the new multilateral trade negotiating round and called on Congress to quickly approve an extension of U.S. negotiating authority.     \"We want to open foreign markets and establish and enforce rules of international competition, not foster dependence on protection and subsidies,\" he said.  \n',trade

'The government must announce harsh cuts in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give an adequate response to Australia\'s economic problems, the ANZ Banking Group Ltd ANZA.S said.     Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14 billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthly Business Indicators publication.     \"For the past two years, the government has struggled with an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it sees as politically practicable,\" it said.     The political climate meant there would be a continued over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and maintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.     \"The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival of business investment will be further postponed,\" it said.     The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by export and import-replacement industries which had created a false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of payments crisis were past. \"Unfortunately, successful adjustment to Australia\'s deep-seated economic problems remains a long-term process,\" it said.     In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderate overall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP) rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.     The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP this year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion at end-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.     Inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988 from 8.9 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were expected, ANZ said.  \n',bop

'South Korea has decided on major changes in its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducing the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a trade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.     Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports could make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase &#127;nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which means abandoning Seoul\'s goal of rapidly reducing its foreign debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.     Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation and rationalising exports.     He said Seoul would try to limit its current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few years, although trade volume would continue to grow.     \"This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP (gross national product) from the current five pct level to three pct by 1991,\" he added.     Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea\'s foreign debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5 billion dlrs at end-1986.     \"But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,\" he said.     The policy change was announced two days before the scheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.     South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.     Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing in South Korea\'s current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose 36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.     The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5 billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw materials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.     \"The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at 1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are considerable incentives given to increase imports,\" Koo said.     Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency. \"It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean currency continues to rise in value,\" he said.     He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the dollar gradually, but added \"We do not believe in rapid one-shot changes in the value of the won.\"     The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen six pct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986.  \n',bop

'Portugal\'s consumer prices rose 1.4 pct in March after a one pct increase in February and a 1.2 pct rise in March 1986, the National Statistics Institute said.     The consumer price index (base 100 for 1976) rose to 772.0 from 761.3 in February and compared with 703.4 in March 1986.     This gave a year-on-year March inflation rate of 9.8 pct against 9.5 pct in February and 12.2 pct in March 1986.     Measured as an annual average rate, inflation in March was 10.9 pct compared with 11.1 pct in February. The government forecasts annual inflation of about eight pct this year.  \n',cpi

'South Africa is expected to unveil tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year in a bid to boost the nation\'s flagging economic growth rate, economic analysts said.     Faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is expected to raise significantly the government\'s overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament, the analysts said.     Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.     \"Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,\" said Rob Lee, chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.     South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct.     Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5 pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over 30 pct.     Economists estimate that the government\'s spending target will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of GDP.     The government, having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget, analysts said.     \"The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,\" said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.     Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets.     South African Mutual\'s Lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49 billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5 pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the IMF.     \"The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,\" predicted one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past two years.     The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in September 1985.     Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation, government officials say economic growth is the prime objective.     But private-sector economists caution that the government\'s ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the current account of the country\'s balance of payments.     Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5 billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the nation\'s estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks.     Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has little room to manoeuvre.     Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and South African Transport Services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.     Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.     \"This will not be a very exciting budget,\" commented Harry Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive Federal Party. \"I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the sweets were given out before the election.\"  \n',cpi
'The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese energy demand, ministry officials said.     MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600 mln, they said.     The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen and a decline in domestic electric power demand.     MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.     They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.     Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan\'s electric power in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27 pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.  \n',crude
'The official Soviet news agency Tass denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would bring no dividends to the Reagan administration.     Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.     \"The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that the latest military adventure will not bring political dividends to the American administration,\" Krutikhin said.     Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.     Soviet officials have previously criticized the United States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their presence serves to increase tension.     Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought broader contacts with Iran in the last year.     Krutikhin said: \"The United States has undertaken an act of armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has long been spoken of by Washington officials.\"  \n',crude
'Australia\'s economy should manage modest growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but unemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     The organisation\'s latest half-yearly report says Gross Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.     The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.     The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.     While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year, however, the report revises downwards the OECD\'s earlier growth forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.     The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is struggling to recover from a major economic crisis.     The country\'s GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year, should again show growth over the next two years, rising by 0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.  \n',gnp
'West German Economics Minister Martin Bangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country\'s leading economic research institutes for early introduction of a major tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.     In a statement reacting to the five institutes\' joint spring report, Bangemann said that as far as the call for bringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --     \"The government points out that the positive effects for growth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budget deficit) must not be allowed to be endangered.\"     Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned for 1988 had already been increased.     Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987, with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.     Bangemann said \"The government, agreeing with the majority, sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for exports expressed by the minority.\"     He said there was reason to believe that export demand would start to rise in the course of the year, partly because of a further increase in world trade.  \n',gnp
'A trade-led boom in the U.S. is unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its latest economic report.     Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year, after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.     As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5 pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke, the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.     \"Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause a falloff in the growth of disposable income,\" Van Dyke said.     Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8 pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.     The report was released before the Commerce Department reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May, after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with a 0.6 pct increase the month before.     The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9 pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.     This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income  growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.     As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.     The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in 1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.     \"For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988 or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,\" Van Dyke said.     Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an improvement in trade. \"However, with protectionist attitudes on the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,\" he added.  \n',gnp
'The Philippines\' first quarter growth figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose Fernandez said in an interview.     The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter from a year earlier.     \"I don\'t see anything on the horizon that should cut it (growth) short,\" Fernandez said.      NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year\'s GNP growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.     \"Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block,\" Fernandez said.     \"I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power, showed that the economy was on a different track from last year,\" he said.     Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it could drop off in the third quarter.     He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in 1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.     \"That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,\" he said.     He said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.     The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling 58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988. Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or August to review performance in the January-June period.     He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs. Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.     \"It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA (official development assistance) accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line,\" he said.     It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.     The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28 billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.     Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984 to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in October last year, had almost been completed.     He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well. \"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,\" he said.     Commenting on the country\'s foreign debt Fernandez said, \"I think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable.\"     The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach 29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.     NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.     Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.     Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country\'s exports more competitive.     \"By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country\'s trading partners,\" he said.     On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the Code.     The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has been delayed by objections from some business groups.     \"I think any central bank, certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and I\'m not about to do that,\" Fernandez said.     \"It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free,\" he said.     \"We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external availabilities simply by servicing our debts.\"  \n',gnp
'Economic growth will remain sluggish in the Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may rise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast.     Belgium\'s GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.     While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming its borrowing requirement, \"it will probably be insufficient to check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,\" the OECD said.     In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5 pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming less competitive and imports rising. \"Employment is forecast to decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the private sector and budgetary cuts,\" the report said.     Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987 and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining domestic gas prices.     Luxembourg\'s economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in wages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year. \n',gnp
'Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax reform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.     \"Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,\" Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.     Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he forecast in the February budget.     And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32 billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.     Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated revenues.     But finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system.     The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1 billion dlrs in 1991.     Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an actual 3.1 pct.     Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around the current four pct level over the next two years.  \n',gnp
'The West German government\'s independent council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said.     A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two pct was achievable.     It added the council believed \"an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for.\"     Ost\'s statement said experts believed further pressure on West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase.     The government regularly uses the term \"changed external economic factors\" when referring to the fall of the dollar, which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but could still fall below the 1986 level.     Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.     The stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the West German government ahead of next week\'s seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.     West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.     The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.     The experts\' prediction for economic growth this year of between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.     Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987 predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct, compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.  \n',gnp
'Figures for first quarter 1987 West German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal Statistics Office said.     The official said there had been a delay in gathering information for the data, which are expected to show that the West German economy contracted in the period.     A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.     \"There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical matter,\" he added.     The West German government is expected to come under pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.     However, government officials have ruled out any further tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.     Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the widest measure of a country\'s economic activity, fell in real terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.      The government has confirmed that growth was negative in the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to be about two pct.     Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank\'s reluctance to cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate, at three pct, is just above historical lows.     West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad, is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over two years.     The government has pointed out that depressed exports are the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will compensate for this setback.     It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.  \n',gnp
'The global economy is expected to weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook, economic analysts said.     For finance ministers and central bankers attending this week\'s semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern.     The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.     In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.     For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product, another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year.     The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt.     IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.     Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.     Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations\'  economies poses fundamental worries.     Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange, including the key one of exports.     The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion, has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only 2.3 pct, according to the IMF.     For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success.     The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade deficit.     Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much slower than expected.     The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect.\"     The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion.\"^M \n',gnp
'France\'s growth rate is expected to strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly higher than in the first half of this year.     The OECD said France\'s economic situation has deteriorated somewhat during the early months of 1987.      Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.     The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.     The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct for the whole year, sharply up from last year\'s 2.2 pct.  \n',gnp
'Malaysia\'s recovery from the worst recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988 after seven years of austerity, economists said.     \"Our country is walking on one leg now,\" said Ismail Salleh, an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International Studies. \"It has to depend on public sector investment for faster growth if the private sector is not moving.\"     Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.     The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply. Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.     The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.     Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.     Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.     One businessman said too many politicians give the impression that Malaysia was unstable.     \"If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential to recover strongly is great,\" a banker said.     Malaysia\'s 1987 current account is expected to be in the black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit surplus compared with last year\'s 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.     The government has said its fiscal policies will balance the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.     The government will also repay some of its external debt, which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.     Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential goods are unlikely to change.     Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to compete for investors with neighbouring states.  \n',gnp
'The five leading West German economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.     The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen predicted in the institutes\' joint spring report that gross national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast three pct 1987 growth in October last year.     Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin and Munich\'s Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.     The joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the DIW and Ifo were \"markedly less favourable\" than those of the other three.     The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year. \"In the second half of 1987 there will, however, only be a weak upward movement,\" they said.     The two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year.     The other three institutes, however, wrote: \"The decline in demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.\"     They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans. But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off. \"It can be presumed that the braking actions (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.\"     They added: \"The domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable.\"     These three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring.     However, this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar.     Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in 1987, \"there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year.\" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.     The three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986, while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.     They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in 1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.     All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23 mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about 200,000.     These three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures. The construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980 but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.     The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector, while \"the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline.\"     The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to 2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.     They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58 billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around 100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.     The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.  \n',gnp
'The five leading West German economic research institutes, which have revised down their forecasts for 1987 growth, do not predict a recession in West Germany, their spokesman, Hans-Juergen Schmahl said.     The institutes were divided in their spring report on forecasts for 1987, with three predicting two pct growth and two seeing only one pct expansion. Growth was 2.4 pct in 1986.     Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said, \"None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the beginning of a recession.\" He added, however, that exports remained the weak point of the economy .     Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect further encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets.     Arthur Krumper of Munich\'s Ifo institute, which with the DIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of the economy, said, \"The braking effects (on the economy) produced by external factors will remain considerable for most of the year.\"  \n',gnp
'Italy\'s economic outlook for 1987 and 1988 is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly lower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade deficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last year Italy ranked as one of the OECD\'s fastest growing economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.     The OECD said Italy\'s GDP may grow by three pct in 1987, but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.     The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report said.     This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.     Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in Italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.  \n',gnp
'Italy\'s Gross Domestic Product, calculated at 1980 prices, rose 2.4 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, compared with the same period in 1985, National Statistics Institute ISTAT said.     ISTAT said in a statement that GDP growth in fourth quarter 1986 was zero compared with the preceding quarter. Italy\'s budget ministry said last month that 1986 GDP rose 2.7 pct in real terms from 1985.     Imports in the fourth quarter totalled 26,361 billion lire, down 1.4 pct from the 1985 fourth quarter and down 6.6 pct from the third 1986 quarter, ISTAT said.     Istat said exports totaled 23,190 billion lire in the fourth quarter, down 4.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter and down 6.7 pct from the third quarter in 1986.     Fixed investments were 23,438 billion lire in the fourth quarter, down 0.7 pct from the preceding quarter and up 1.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter.  \n',gnp
'Prospects for world economic growth remain very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize currencies and encourage investment, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.     \"The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months, and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments imbalances are likely to persist,\" it said in one of its gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.     The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only 2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year\'s 2.5 pct growth rate.     \"We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area comfortably exceeding three pct,\" David Henderson, head of the OECD\'s economics and statistics department, said.     The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S., Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic downturn.     \"At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth remain favorable,\" it said, citing low inflation in most major countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible labor markets.     But private sector confidence had been undermined by uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that \"for confidence to be restored, it is important for governments swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.\"     This was a clear reference to last February\'s Louvre accord of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.     The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.     Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this process, though it was too early to estimate its precise impact.     He said the measures will help strengthen Japan\'s domestic demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.     The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct increase in 1986.     There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last year.     The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from price guarantees and other measures linked to production towards direct income support for farmers.  \n',gnp
'High wage settlements in Nordic countries threaten to cut exports and reduce the international competitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration in competitiveness. Sweden\'s competitive position was also seen at risk from accelerating wages.     The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as Norway, Sweden and Finland.     Overall economic growth will vary in the different countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report said.     After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark and Norway.     Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained and balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.  \n',gnp
'West German economic growth will slow to 1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic demand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its semi-annual review of the world economy.     This view is less favourable than the West German government\'s forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.     The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year, with the gross national product rising by two pct in real terms.     The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some recovery in business confidence in the near future.     But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by 2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986\'s 3.7 pct.     While noting that the government is bringing forward a five billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that \"the medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow relatively lower tax rates.\"     Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of 1986.     Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.     West Germany\'s current account surplus, the target of considerable criticism by the Reagan administration, is expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from 35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in 1988.  \n',gnp
'The United States should take urgent action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on growth of the defense budget, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy, said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit \"could seriously affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere.\"     It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987, running until September 30 this year, would substantially overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act\'s target of 144 billion dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.     \"The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190 billion dollars,\" it said.     While this would be 30 billion lower than last year\'s deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.     The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to 2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.     In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.     Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.     \"Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors behind the avoidance of recession,\" the report said.     The current account balance of payments deficit is expected to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.     In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year, unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct this year.     Canada\'s current account deficit is projected to shrink to around four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about that level in 1988.  \n',gnp
'Pakistan says its economy has continued its recent outstanding performance during the financial year 1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments, investments and energy were causing concern.     GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980 and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according to a government economic survey.      The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum and there was an impressive performance in a five point government program for rural uplift, education and poverty alleviation, said the survey.     Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.     The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.     Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from 2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.     More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in home remittances, he said.     The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to 2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of the boost in exports.     He said national investment continued to be small because of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the present growth rate and to finance the country\'s seventh five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.  \n',gnp
'Portugal\'s economy, which has been enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade, may now be strong enough to shrug off the country\'s latest government crisis, analysts said.     But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva\'s government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.     Cavaco Silva\'s minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.     The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office.     In 1986, Portugal\'s economy grew four pct, its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.     Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken.     \"The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation,\" said Fritz Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.     \"The market doesn\'t see this as a real crisis yet,\" economist Jorge Braga de Macedo tolds.     Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress.     The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution.     Portugal\'s developing stock markets, however, remain buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.     Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell, predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year.     But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development.     Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month, can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament.     Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution. \"There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections,\" Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said.     He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year.     The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority.     A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.     Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms.     The left-wingers said Portugal\'s positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD policies.  \n',gnp
'South Africa recorded annualised real growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this year and the economy should achieve the government\'s target of three pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.     The South African central bank said in its quarterly bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the nation\'s gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement in the rand\'s exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.     It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the third and fourth quarters of last year.     It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement reached with international creditors in March as evidence of improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.     The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa\'s short term foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.     South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of 7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus of 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninth consecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985.  \n',gnp
'South Korea\'s gross national product (GNP) will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise further as long as the current account surplus continues to widen, Deputy Prime Minister Chun In-Yong told reporters.     Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said his GNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will remain stable.     The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct.     GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and 1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures.     GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.     In the first four months of this year, the current account swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period.     \"What the Minister said does not imply any major economic policy change,\" a Ministry spokesman tolds. \"But he tried to urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic (future) ... A high won era.\"     South Korean manufacturers, who have insisted the won should not rise more than seven pct this year, have said they plan to ask the government to slow down its appreciation against the dollar.     The Bank of Korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05 against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986.     The won strengthened by 6.60 won to the dollar in three days earlier this month while an International Monetary Fund team held talks here to discuss revaluation.  \n',gnp
'Strong growth in domestic demand was a key feature of the economies of southern European countries in 1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal\'s total domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption.     Turkey\'s economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year.     In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment, had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong.     The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European Community and declining competitiveness.     In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather.  \n',gnp
'The economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.     Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.     \"These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?\" said Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.     The Commerce Department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.     Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending rose a weak 0.1 per cent.     \"Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing -- are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, \" Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics, tolds.     Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages.     To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise, returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption, he says.     \"I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,\" Gramley said.     Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia.     Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, \"The pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy\" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be accommodative.     Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession.     Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an inventory overhang still exists.     He says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.     \"They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a recession,\" Mauro said.     In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve.     \"Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable,\" he said.     But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation.     Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.     The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.     \"The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle, it continues to persist,\" he said, adding he would like the Fed to tighten credit.     A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says a prominent international banker.     Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National Press Club that the dollar\'s downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the United States is the world\'s largest debtor nation.     The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever. \"It is very difficult to be optimistic,\" Gut said.  \n',gnp
'The five leading West German economic research institutes said the government should do more to stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of tax cuts planned for 1990.     In their joint spring report the institutes were divided about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national product grew 2.4 pct last year.     But the report said all the institutes believed that \"more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created.\"     The institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. \"From this point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be brought forward.\"     The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.     However, the institutes criticised the government, not only for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of its financing had been left open.     The government has not specified how the remaining 19 billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for, though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.     The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government.     They also said the government should reduce tax preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value-added tax.     The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.     They referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this as an increase in subsidies.     The institutes said total subsidies, including tax preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it should be possible \"despite ... Major political difficulties\" to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.     The institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.     The report also noted that the government was progressing only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim for more competition, it said.  \n',gnp

'The Agriculture Ministry declined comment on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.     \"We have no idea about the report and cannot comment,\" a spokesman tolds.     Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources, said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for farm talks.     The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.     Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff Control Act.

'The Pakistani government allowed the private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy announced to cover the next three years.     Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn.     Cotton and rice are Pakistan\'s main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and rice along with the state corporations.     He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and to enable them to compete effectively in the world market.

'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.     Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry\'s Economic Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help Japan as well as the United States.     The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.     However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was already the world\'s largest grain importer.     Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food requirements in 1985.     Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on beef, citrus products and rice.     Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice because potential production is higher than domestic demand.     The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of rising production by exporting countries, he added.     Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product output with expensive programs, Maki said.     Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter will join.  \n',grain
'White House Budget chief James Miller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might \"overreact\" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession next year.     \"Our greatest danger is overreaction,\" Miller told newspaper reporters yesterday. \"I\'m concerned about the Fed\'s overreaction. I\'m concerned about what I see in recent data showing a substantial fall in the money supply.\"     Edwin Dale, Miller\'s spokesman, said the remarks, published in the New York Times today, were accurate.     Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he said could have \"political consequences.\"     The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential and congressional elections next year.     \"My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep soup, and there is no question about it,\" he said.     Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax revenues and a widening of the budget deficit.     Miller\'s remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of bolstering the dollar.     Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize global growth prospects.     U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist pressures in the United States.  \n',interest
'Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.     With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark, Schlesinger tolds that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed.     The economy is picking up, after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth, he added. \"We may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter,\" he said in an interview.     Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.     Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in 1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.     He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct.    \"It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly,\" he said, noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.     Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank\'s three to six pct target.     He said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.     \"There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed,\" Schlesinger said.     A major reason for the inflows was the market\'s conviction that the mark was headed higher. \"As we can see from the market, expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished,\" Schlesinger said.     The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.     Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87 marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.     At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.     \"Central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,\" Schelsinger said.     \"One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,\" he said, adding, \"It is not only our own case, it is also the American case.\"     He said that the West German export industry has been hit hard by the dollar\'s sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now. \"But it wouldn\'t be good to have short-term fluctuations,\" he said. \"Let us wait and see.\"     \"It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level (of rates) as such,\" Schlesinger said.     The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West German inflation down year.     Although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.     Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term, in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.     The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16 months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank\'s council, Schlesigner said.     But he added: \"I don\'t see any great pressure to go away from it.\"  \n',interest
'The head of Spain\'s employers\' federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried about the government\'s monetary policies because high real interest rates were hampering investment.     He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this year were not endangering the government\'s five pct inflation target. The government\'s perceived need to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.     High real interest rates were attracting an influx of speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the government\'s target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.     Spain\'s most closely-watched measure of money supply, liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17 pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.     To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from 11.8 at end-1986.     Cuevas said employers were heeding the government\'s call to hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year, with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.     These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.     He said Spain\'s current wave of strikes mainly affected the state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five pct wage ceiling.     Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in Spain\'s foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct increase over the corresponding period last year.     However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the peseta to correct the imbalance.  \n',interest
'Today\'s U.K. Economic data have pushed the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.     A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing production data showed that the economy is still strong and does not need a fillip from lower rates.     News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually, taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist arguments against easier credit, they said.     \"The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near term,\" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.     Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday\'s mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K. Rates.     It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such optimistic economic news as May\'s record reserves rise which mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling\'s strength.     The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm about May\'s 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying average earnings in April, dealers said.     The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset the impact on domestic money supply of its current intervention.     \"The gilt market reaction was correct,\" said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.     \"That\'s very important ... It shows the economy in a very good state indeed,\" Skeoch said.     \"There\'s no reason to get worries about inflationary pressures because they\'re very subdued.\" Unit wage cost rises were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings which were potentially inflationary, he added.     \"I don\'t think these average earnings numbers are a major problem,\" agreed Chase Manhattan\'s Marshall.     But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried about the funding implications of recent intervention.     He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that the ruling Conservatives would win last week\'s election, now looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.     However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still trigger a base rate cut and that today\'s figures did not signal higher inflation this year.     \"Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As long as that continues we\'re okay,\" he added.  \n',interest
'The Federal Reserve will promote lower interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth, First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.     As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without subverting national U.S. economic policy.     \"On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and, because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its part by moving rates down,\" Wojnilower said in a report.     \"Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants have seen little to fear,\" Wojnilower said.     He said last week\'s \"hiccup\" in money and currency rates and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.     Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.  \n',interest

'An income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.     Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies.     The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech. He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could be much higher than the government\'s 1.3 billion dlr forecast.     Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.     He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986, but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact. Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation.     The government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.     New Zealand\'s inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.     The major deficiency in the government\'s anti-inflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.     \"The widespread belief that (New Zealand\'s) problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based -- primarily because the government\'s macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,\" Bayliss said.  \n',money-fx
'Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support the dollar, other than foreign exchange intervention.

Yesterday\'s intervention was large in terms of the countries involved and the amounts expended, he said.

'Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an advisory panel to the government\'s Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said.     The advisory body said in its report that the yen would soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global basis were delayed.     An EPA official tolds the dollar could fall to slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to restructure their economies.     The dollar\'s fall without structural adjustments would cut Japan\'s current account surplus to two pct of gross national product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually during the seven-year period to 1993.     If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan\'s current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This scenario put Japan\'s GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.     It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.  \n',money-fx
'The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.     Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth.?#5;&#30;side measures to boost growth, he said.      \"I think it is possible that there may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in Germany,\" he added, but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.     Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on \"a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.\"     He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced \"satisfactory exchange rate stability,\" in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and he was \"content\" with sterling\'s exchange rate.     Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May currency reserves announced today he said, \"we have been playing a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.\"     Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic commitments underlying the accord.     \"Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in Paris ... In this respect.\" He said the U.S. Budget deficit was \"very important.\"     Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson said, \"what is really needed in Japan is an increase in merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.\"     \"There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified,\" he said.     Lawson doubted that Tokyo\'s partners would indulge in \"Japan bashing\" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of Nakasone\'s plans to increase Japanese development aid over the next three years.     Japan\'s more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.     He said he thought West Germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth.     In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of German national industries.     On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to make progress in Venice.     The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.     Lawson said he would seek \"to consolidate political backing for the plan at the Venice summit\" and hoped the programme would be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.     He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt provisions.     \"First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,\" he said.     U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations, strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions. \"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,\" Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions.     He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit. \"There is a consensus, which we have to push further.\"  \n',money-fx
'Analysts said they were surprised at the government\'s announcement of a forecast budget surplus for fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy statements and positive for the economy.     Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.     Analysts polled bys said the forecast budget surplus was even more positive than the most bullish analysts\' forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.     Market expectations among analysts questioned bys before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a 2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.     The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically, the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.     However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will move lower.     The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget release.     Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share market, despite an increase in the contribution of company taxation to revenue figures.     One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus announcement could push the share market up by 50 points tomorrow.     The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a continuation of existing policies, and the absence of traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively by overseas investors, another said.     But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share market, particularly multi-national companies.     The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements, through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.     Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely credible.     \"Altogether it looks good for Labour\'s election prospects,\" he said.     An election is due before the end of September.  \n',money-fx

In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here, Poehl said \"It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit.\"     He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route.     Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth.     He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament.     But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.     Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home.     \"A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth,\" he said.     Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.     But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy.     The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.     \"For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful,\" he said.     He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan\'s trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States.     Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated.     All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said.     \"This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues,\" he said.     But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar\'s value could overshoot.  \n',money-fx

'New U.S. Banking data suggest the Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists said.     But they also said that if money supply growth remains weak, as this week\'s unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary policy.     A survey of 17 money market economists produced a forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June 8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.     Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for the week ended June 1, this means the nation\'s money supply has fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks, economists said.     \"M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,\" said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.     While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen as better gauges of economic growth.     Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed\'s 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.     If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials, concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging, could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.     \"Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open market position? No,\" Sullivan said. \"But does this mean the end of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.\"     Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.     But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day net miss in the Fed\'s reserve projections, the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached.     A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging, while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.     \"If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed easing at some point,\" he said.     Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth. \"It has been a number of years since M-1 has given good signs of what\'s going on in the economy,\" one said. \"I don\'t think M-1 shows that the economy is falling apart and the Fed should ease.\"     Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary policy.     They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke off econmomic growth.     But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late April. \"The Fed has to determine if this represents a fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives them more room to ease,\" he said.  \n',money-supply
'Robert Heller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said he expects \"more modest levels\" of growth in the money supply this year.     \"In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a most desireable development,\" he said in a speech prepared for delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange, Calif.     A text was released in Washington.     He said the effect of lower inflation and financial deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.     \"Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest levels,\" Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed after mid-January.     \"I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as well,\" he added.     Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.     \"The pricing behavior of American producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future,\" he said.     Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would \"generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector\" and might not gain more market share for U.S. producers.     \"A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be the result of such a behavior pattern,\" Heller warned.     He said \"we at the Federal Reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy.\"      Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes.     \"The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets,\" Heller said.     He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.     A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with Canada \"would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American producers to compete more effectively in that country,\" Heller said.  \n',money-supply
'Four of West Germany\'s five leading economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.     But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin, echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not necessarily threaten stability.     The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.     The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.     Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may seem exaggerated, they said.     \"But it has often turned out in the past that the price climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into a restrictive policy,\" they said.     The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.     The four institutes disputed the view that monetary expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market investments following lower interest rates.     \"Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a smaller expansion of money supply,\" they said.     A return to growth and stability did not require spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.     The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic weakness other factors should be taken into account.     Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat in itself to price stability.     The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the falling mark.  \n',money-supply

'The U.S. is drafting options including possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over the differential between soybean and product  taxes which Buenos Aires levies on exports.

A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), which seeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the north to Lesotho in the south, said the governments would make the first tariff cut next year.     In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariff reductions and work out a new timetable for the complete elimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000.     The PTA, set up in 1982, groups Burnudi, the Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Somalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.     PTA sources said the agreement averted a split between members wanting more progress towards free trade and weaker states concerned about the effects on customs revenue.     The reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widely traded commodities and goods but PTA sources said the organisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items.  \n',trade
'Talks between the European Community (EC) and the United States have failed to settle a trade dispute over pasta, an EC Commission spokesman said.     Diplomatic sources said the dispute could provoke new trade friction unless it was settled soon.     Washington is insisting that the EC comply with what it regards as an unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and cut export subsidies which have allowed Italy to take an increasing share of the U.S. pasta market.     The EC provides subsidies of about 16 cents a pound on pasta exports. The spokeswoman said the talks foundered on the question of how much the subsidy should be cut.  \n',trade
'Mounting trade friction between the U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia\'s exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said.     They told correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S. Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.     But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo\'s loss might be their gain.     The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in retaliation for Japan\'s alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.     Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes.     \"We wouldn\'t be able to do business,\" said a spokesman for leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd MC.T.     \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,\" said Tom Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker James Capel and Co.     In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.     \"We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to us,\" said a senior Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.     Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.     The surplus helped swell Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world\'s largest.     \"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,\" said Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters Taiwan Safe Group.     A senior official of South Korea\'s trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports are similar to those of Japan.     Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.     In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U.S.     In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further U.S. Pressure to block imports.     \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.     \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said.     The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong\'s biggest export market, accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.     The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern, Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.     \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very serious matter,\" Button said.     He said Australia\'s concerns centred on coal and beef, Australia\'s two largest exports to Japan and also significant U.S. Exports to that country.     Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the trade stand-off continue.     Japan\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.     The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget and record public works spending in the first half of the financial year.     They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s avowed fiscal reform program.     Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto Kuroda, Japan\'s deputy minister of International Trade and Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an effort to end the dispute.  \n',trade

'Brazil\'s September trade surplus was the best so far this year, totalling 1.494 billion dlrs, compared with 1.434 billion dlrs in August and 540 mln dlrs in September last year, Banco do Brasil\'s Foreign Trade Department (Cacex) director Namir Salek said in a news conference.     September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down from 2.76 billion dlrs in August. Imports in September amounted to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August.     Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a similar 1986 period.     Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222 mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986, Salek said.     The Cacex director said he expected the country\'s trade surplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three months of the year, estimating the year\'s overall surplus to reach 10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and 15.4 billion dlrs of imports.     He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured and semimanufactured goods. He mentioned car exports, which accounted alone with sales of 617 mln dlrs in the Jan-Sept period, against 194 mln dlrs in a similar 1986 period.  \n',trade
'A British minister said he had given the Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its internal markets \"and it was clearly understood.\"     Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were beginning to appreciate the need to be \"fair and open\" about access to their own markets.     At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition charges that his trip had been a failure because he had returned empty-handed.     \"I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very clearly, and it has been clearly understood.\"     Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in Britain.     \"It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing them to carry out other kinds.\"     \"I hope we don\'t have to use these powers, but I made it clear in Japan that if our timetable isn\'t met, we shall use them.\"     He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.     \"I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to be fair and open about access to their own markets.\"     On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L, which is trying to win a significant share of telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.     He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday, he said.     Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan, but would have to coordinate action with its European Community partners.

'Australian Minister for Trade Negotiations Michael Duffy said his country and Third World commodity producers have formed an effective lobby group against farm export subsidies and market access restrictions.     Duffy told a press conference the Cairns Group of 14 major agricultural producers, to which Australia and Thailand belong, has emerged as an important third force in any multilateral trade talks. \"There\'s no doubt that the Cairns Group is being seen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in other international trade negotiations,\" he said.     Duffy, here on a three-day visit after talks in the United States, The European Community (EC) and Latin America, said considerable progress has been made by the group towards fighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed countries.

'Canada has threatened to stop imports of Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish agriculture ministry official tolds.     The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached for support.     Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: \"Denmark will not accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC.\"     Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.     Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.     But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC regulations. \"Canadian officials are very concerned about the trade implications.

Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to exercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries were considering establishing a joint commission to study the growing steel problem.

The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from several countries in the face of a decline in the domestic steel industry.

'Canada\'s trade picture has brightened considerably, underscoring economists\' predictions the sector would post a long awaited recovery this year.     The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February, double January\'s 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986\'s 189 mln dlr tally.     \"Hopefully it\'s the beginning of a trend,\" said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.     Economists generally don\'t expect such large gains over the next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year.     \"We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year, and it certainly looks as if this morning\'s figure is indicative of that,\" commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.     Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month.     \"Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in February,\" the agency said in its monthly report.     Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.     Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year\'s dismal 10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion dlrs.     Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.     The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading.

Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.     The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading.     Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy.     They say the country\'s consumers, who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country.     Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United States, by far the country\'s largest market, is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.     \"We maintain what\'s going to drive Canada\'s export performance is income growth in the U.S.,\" said Midland\'s Donegan.     But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February\'s trade upturn.     Jestin said, \"Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate that part of the strength (in Canada\'s trade figures) is probably transitory.\"  \n',trade

He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only 350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their level at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.     Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.     Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved incentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain more foreign exchange from the goods they sell.     He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose 35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46 billion.

'The European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC officials said.     Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat, fish and cereals by-products.     But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the officials said.     The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.     Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat, saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500 tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.     Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.     The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal\'s entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).     But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country\'s EC membership.     Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada.     Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC claims that Spain and Portugal\'s entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation.     Japan\'s main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.

'The European Community (EC) has effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its market to imports before it decides on possible tough retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.     They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26 to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.     The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are \"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.\"     Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese exports.     The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action.     They said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.     In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.

Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the U.S.     The EC Executive Commission said today the European Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.     Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the Japanese.     The Commission said it believed the Association had given sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found the complaints were justified.

When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT jargon as \"standstill and rollback.\"     Tran criticised Washington for the \"superfund\" tax on oil imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government procurement list for reasons of national security.     Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.     The surveillance body will send a record of today\'s talks to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round, to decide any further action on the charges.     The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.     The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel\'s report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its legislation.     Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community, brought the dispute to the GATT last year.  \n',trade
'Colombian exports other than coffee rose 55 pct in January compared with the same period last year, figures from the government statistics institute show.     Non-coffee exports amounted to 180.8 mln dlrs fob compared with 147.5 mln dlrs for coffee, a drop of 42 pct from last year.     The trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared with a 56 mln dlr surplus in January 1986.     The national planning department forecast that in 1987 coffee, Colombia\'s traditional major export, will account for only one third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs.  \n',trade
'The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm\'s total annual export earnings for export promotion abroad.     The move is designed by the government to improve India\'s trade deficit.     Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.     The scheme replaces current rules which allow different amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.     RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value of annual export earnings.     These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil, psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.     RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.     Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.  \n',trade
'With more private investment, not more protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two congressional agencies said today.     The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S. textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for optimism than a few years ago.     \"While textile producers are making significant investments, they could do more,\" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.     The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than increased trade protection which could lead to foreign retaliation.     CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections, first imposed in the 1950\'s have had only a small benefit for profits and investments of domestic firms.     Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against congressional approval of protectionist textile quota legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other Asian textile producing countries.     President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is expected to be voted on in the House this year.     However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles showed a weakening of support for the legislation.     Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic markets, Kelly said.     He added that private investment in the textile and clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.     Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.     \"The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered, and that exports can be expanded,\" Kelly said.  \n',trade
'Israel\'s exports to the U.S. can and must double over the next five years if the mideast nation\'s goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad Yaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.     Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S. were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel\'s total exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.     \"I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis on product quality,\" Yaacobi said.     While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European currencies is a \"bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,\" Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend toward higher U.S. exports.     In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.     Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.      He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would continue to facilitate the desired export growth.     Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S. firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.     Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able to achieve its economic potential.     Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing military conflicts \"which were imposed on Israel,\" he said.     Short of achieving Israel\'s full growth potential, however, Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.  \n',trade
'Italy\'s Foreign Trade Minister Mario Sarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press, said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign securities.     Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month\'s overall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April\'s 2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign securities purchases.    \"The deficit can be better attributed to premature and delayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags) rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment,\" Sarcinelli said in a statement.     Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by the Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and said it had been partly caused by \"non-banking capital outflows.\"     \"In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flow of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our borders,\" said the newspaper.     But the newspaper added that it was still not possible to say how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchase deposits had affected Italy\'s balance of payments.  \n',trade
'Japan is disappointed at the recent threats of trade retaliation from the European Community (EC) just as the trade situation between the two is improving, Japanese Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura said.     \"I am deeply concerned that the EC has moved to take a harsher line toward Japan despite this tangible improvement,\" he said in a speech prepared for delivery at the opening of a new centre designed to improve understanding between the two sides.     Last week, foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations agreed to impose tariffs on a range of unspecified Japanese electrical goods unless Tokyo opened its markets more to EC exports.     Tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in Japanese imports of EC manufactured goods in the year ended March 31.     \"I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance through expansion.\"     \"While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficit between Japan and the EC, I believe it should be rectified not by reducing trade through import restrictions or export restraints, but by expanding the (overall) trade,\" Tamura said.  \n',trade
'Japan\'s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of the committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said.     The plan will also urge the government to double 1985\'s official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior LDP officials said at a press conference.     LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain the plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.     Abe\'s visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.     Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated. However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe will be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.     The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by the government will probably include the purchase of super computers, LDP officials said.     According to the plan, Japan will also strive to solve specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.     The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and lessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.     The basic ideas of the LDP\'s plan were presented to and welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial nations in Washington last week, they said.     The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be unveiled by the government in late May.  \n',trade
'Basic reform of Japan\'s protected farm sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade surplus, securities analysts said.     The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they said.     \"In economic terms, reform would be a plus,\" said Christopher Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.     The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S., The analysts said.     Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the average household\'s budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.     Reducing these prices could increase household spending power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on products which would have a more direct impact in boosting domestic growth, it added.     \"There\'s a lot of slack,\" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo said. \"All that money could be spent on something else.\"     Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37 billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.     Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential development would also give a boost to domestic spending, economists said.     \"Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the expansion of domestic demand,\" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor at Kyoto Gakuen University.     Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the farm sector. Employers groups also want change. \"If you really want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,\" Bumpei Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers\' Associations told a recent press conference.     External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade deficits with Japan.     But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.     Although the full-time farm population is falling and there are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.     The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon, the analysts said.     Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for national food security, they said.     Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.     Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.  \n',trade
'A top U.S. Official said Japan has little chance of persuading the U.S. to drop threatened trade sanctions, despite the efforts of a Japanese team that left for Washington today.     Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, was asked at a press conference whether Japan\'s moves to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could persuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports said, and replied: \"...It is probably too early for the figures to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to permit the result you have described.\"     Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.     \"There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area, but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on security and political issues,\" he said.     \"The question is whether through cooperative actions between our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist legislation,\" he said.  \n',trade
'Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports.     Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan\'s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.     The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japan\'s failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.     They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers.     Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.     President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement.     In making the annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade.\"     Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan\'s semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.     Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan\'s inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.     About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.     Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.     Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.     He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan\'s decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI\'s power to control Japanese traders.     \"The United States has excessive expectations.,\" he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.\"     He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.  \n',trade
'Japan\'s Agriculture Ministry, angered by U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan, a senior ministry official said.     \"Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers,\" the official, who declined to be named, said. \"Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market,\" he said.     Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S. Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers.     Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said. End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.     U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.     Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31.     Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.     U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.     An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S. Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business.     The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices, purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts, prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.     To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan\'s top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products.     But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector.     \"Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these issues should not be discussed on the same table,\" the official said.  \n',trade
'Japan must try harder to reduce its trade surplus or the yen will come under renewed upward pressure, Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo.     He told a press luncheon he hoped Japan could cut its current account surplus by some 10 billion dlrs a year until it is reduced to some 50 to 60 billion dlrs. In the fiscal year ended March 31 the surplus totalled 93.76 billion dlrs, or about 4.5 pct of GNP.     The 6,000 billion yen economic stimulation package the government unveiled late last month would help slash Japan\'s current account surplus by five to six billion dlrs, he said.  \n',trade
'Japan\'s trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct.     But it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988, \"thus weakening the international adjustment process.\"     It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.     The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.     The OECD outlook said, \"Continued large current account surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen.\" It said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth.     The OECD said Japan\'s Gross National Product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986\'s 2.5 pct growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a 0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.  \n',trade

However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.     Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called Japan\'s failure to honour a July 1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the United States and to open its home market to American goods.

'The tough trade sanctions President Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across Japan\'s bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.     But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings Institution, a think tank, said \"a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern.\"     He said it left the United States open to retaliation.     The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws, and no new protectionist legislation is needed.     In the past year tough trade action had been taken against the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights, patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a \"serious signal\" to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.     Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers, television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the American consumer, Fitzwater said.     Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.     The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.     The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about one-third of America\'s overall deficit.     But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all.     Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that \"I regret that these actions are necessary,\" but that the health and vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to American competitiveness in world markets.     \"We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices,\" Reagan added in the statement from his California vacation home at Santa Barbara.     He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan abided by the agreement.     U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress - which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.     The White House aide said of the tariff action, \"it wasn\'t done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade practice.\"     The aide added, however, \"on another plane, it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws.\"     But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the United States, and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.     \"It\'s very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,\" he said, \"because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade.\"     Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country, and therefore its impact on Congress.\"     He said, \"I don\'t think it makes a lot of sense.\"     But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress, and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.     Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don\'t want a trade war,\" but the imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.     Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country, and therefore its impact on Congress.\"     He said, \"I don\'t think it makes a lot of sense.\"     But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress, and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.

'A group of Latin American and Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.     Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of American States special committee on trade, said he was aware of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added \"the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills.\"     He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit, and \"it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests.\"     Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.     Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large, annual trade surpluses with the United States.     Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States, but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2 billion dlrs, against Japan\'s of 58.6 billion dlrs.     The European Community has also opposed the bills.     Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration\'s opposition to many of the sections in the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.     He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor, expected next week.     Rodriguez said \"the region needs trade to continue development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation.\"     Rodriguez said: \"we need to keep the market opens - especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress.\"     President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed \"protectionist,\" and his aides now are mounting a effort to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the legislation.     Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez said as yet \"the administration is not in a veto frame of mind.\"  \n',trade
'Malaysia\'s manufacturing exports rose by 24.5 pct to 15.1 billion ringgit in 1986, chairman of the Export Promotion Council Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamind said.     The improved export performance was led by electrical and electronic products, textiles, footwear, clothing, processed food, timber, chemical and rubber products, he told a news conference.     However, total gross exports for the year declined by 5.6 pct to 35.9 billion ringgit from 38 billion in 1985 due to a fall in major commodity exports and weak prices, he said.  \n',trade
'Pakistani government allowed freer cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed at narrowing the country\'s yawning trade gap.     Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech the government had also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of Pakistani products.         Cotton and rice are Pakistan\'s main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s.     But Haq said now the private sector would also export cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a long-standing demand of the local traders.     The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries compete effectively in the world market, he said.         Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but reviewed every year.     It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a longer period.     He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided for the export of engineering goods to selected third world countries on soft credit terms.         Pakistan\'s 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23 billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.     He said the government policy was to rationalise and streamline import controls.     \"It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports, specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,\" he said. \"Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise to smuggling and hampering of exports.\"         He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed from import restrictions.     Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.  \n',trade

'President Reagan called for continued nondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United States in the face of congressional opposition because of the Bucharest government\'s record on human rights.     A White House statement said Reagan\'s decision to press for continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for Romania had been \"exceptionally difficult\" and came after \"all options were seriously considered.\"     But the statement said that despite concerns about human rights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president had decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on human rights practices there.     The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress requests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungary and China.     The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill legislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending certification by Reagan that the country had made progress on human rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFN for Hungary and China.  \n',trade
'President Reagan today is to announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls Japan\'s failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade.     The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative\'s Office.     Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film.     The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.     In his March annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.\"     He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.     U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagan\'s plan to invoke the sanctions.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  \"we do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action.\"     Reagan\'s move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits, with last year\'s hitting a record $169.8 billion.     About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.     Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.     He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.     Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation.     The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the results showed up.     U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.     Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT).     It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.     U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States.  \n',trade
'South Korea will cut import taxes on 50 goods, including construction equipment, cigarettes and tobacco, to help reduce its trade surplus with the United States, the Finance Ministry said today. The tariff cuts of between five and 30 pct will take effect on July 1.     South Korea ran a trade surplus of 7.3 billion dlrs with Washington in 1986, sharply up from 4.3 billion in 1985.     Today\'s announcement brings to 157 the number of goods for which similar measures were taken this year, a ministry official said.

The U.S. Deficit, which we all decry, has been in a sense the place into which everyone\'s export-led strategy for growth has gone.\"     \"The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed on this deficit, so something will have to give and it will be possibly a traumatic experience,\" he added.     \"While you must keep up the pressure on us to eschew protectionist policies, you must act too,\" Shultz said.     \"I can do a better job of convincing the Congress to leave our door open to imports if more of our trading partners open their doors wider,\" he told the group, which included representatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the European Community.  \n',trade

Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand the U.S. Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many now believed.     He said ASEAN\'s looming trade problems would not necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being contemplated by Congress, \"but simply because of the adjustments the U.S. Economy will have to make in order to service our large and growing external debt.\"     Shultz said the U.S. Deficit had resulted not from falling exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth.  \n',trade
'U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last week went further than the U.S. Had expected.     But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.     Speaking in a televised news conference linking several European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and global demand.      \"There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was originally thought,\" said Shultz, speaking from Washington.     \"It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.     \"It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the economy,\" he added.     But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might decide at next week\'s Venice summit to lift its sanctions on some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:     \"These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an agreement that had been reached between the United States and Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip market.     \"They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the agreement that it made become evident.\"     He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a trend on only one month\'s data.     The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that Japan had violated last September\'s bilateral agreement by selling computer chips at below fair market value.     Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.     Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the problem.     He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would contain a major reduction.  \n',trade

'South Korea\'s trade surplus is growing too fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.     He told a press conference the government planned to increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus \"at a proper level.\"     But he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.     The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.     Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years.     \"Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now the surplus is growing faster than we expected,\" he said.     Trade ministry officials said South Korea\'s exports rose 35 pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.     Kim said the swing of South Korea\'s current account to a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time.     South Korea\'s foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest in Asia.     \"This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development... Last year was a major turning point for the Korean economy,\" Kim said.     Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country\'s GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from about 50 pct in 1986.     \"The government, however, does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,\" he said.     Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with Seoul\'s major trading partners, particularly the United States.     \"We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a proper level,\" Kim said.  \n',trade

'Taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with Washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the United States.     Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry\'s Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington.     \"The move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United States,\" he said.

The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added.     Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the island\'s largest trading partner.     Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with Taipei.     Washington\'s deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year earlier, Taiwan\'s official figures show.

The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.     Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they should pay about the same rates of duties.     Yeutter said, \"American exporters will find it far easier to deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of differing systems which they now face.\"     He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.

'The Commerce Department said on that insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1 billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.     The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after the initial trade report to issue a second report on a \"customs value\" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance charges from the cost of imports.     Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.     A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been revised downward.     The Commerce department would like to have the law changed to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.     \"My feeling is the second one is a better report but there\'s legislation that requires us to delay it two days,\" said Robert Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.     \"But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays any attention to the second figure.\"     The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.

Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison with other countries that reported their trade balances on the same basis.

'The United States may lift an additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later this month, Reagan Administration officials said.     President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.     The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and portable computers.     Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at below production costs.     Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.     The Administration officials said Commerce Department  monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking sales away from American-made semiconductors.     They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would be lifted by the end of the month.     The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.     U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan\'s compliance with the agreement earlier this week.

'The use of tariffs and quotas to reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do little to cut the nation\'s swelling trade deficit, a government study said.     In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said, such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re-exported in different forms.     \"Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,\" it said.

Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.     \"Although each industry\'s competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find that there have been no significant industry-specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit,\" the study said.     \"To the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,\" the FTC study said.     Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.     It also said it found a \"fairly direct relationship\" between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign consumer demand.     The study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.     In each case, the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.  \n',trade
'The United States is prepared to \"pull out all the stops\" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador to GATT Michael Samuels said.     Those rights are now being challenged by the European Community\'s (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.     He reiterated Washington\'s firm intention to retaliate if the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.     The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat shipments into the EC.     The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S. trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed prices over the current market level and which may be extended to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.     Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies, an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade negotiations, \"is meaningless if import barriers continue to be erected,\" Samuels said.     Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, \"visionary\" and \"very serious.\"  The EC and Japan have said it is unrealistic.     The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally next week.     The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of farm subsidies.     The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major trade distortions, Samuels said.     Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally submitted and respond to it officially then.     \"We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,\" the U.S. Ambassador said.     The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.     The key difference between the two approaches is that the U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.     If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze, there would be little incentive for the Community to work to correct the international trade situation, he added.     Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.  \n',trade
'A trade bill before the United States House of Representatives \"is a very dangerous bill for Canadian industry,\" Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told reporters.     By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S. countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3 removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.     \"Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language,\" he said.     The Canadian forest lobby\'s Zimmerman also said the House of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian resource exports to the U.S.     Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber to the U.S., Zimmerman added.     Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S. forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.     \"We represent the first victim of the move to price other countries\' natural resources according to the U.S. system,\" Zimmerman said.     \"If we\'re an example, than other resource industries had better watch out,\" he added.     Zimmerman said the Canadian Forest Industry Council plans to discuss concerns about the U.S. trade bill with lobby groups from other Canadian resource industries.  \n',trade
'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.     Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry\'s Economic Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help Japan as well as the United States.     The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.     However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was already the world\'s largest grain importer.     Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food requirements in 1985.     Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on beef, citrus products and rice.     Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice because potential production is higher than domestic demand.     The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of rising production by exporting countries, he added.     Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product output with expensive programs, Maki said.     Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter will join.  \n',trade
'The White House has completed a new review of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan last April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.     They said the president\'s Economic Policy Council looked at Japan\'s adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.     But there was no hint what the announcement might be.     Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.     But they also noted that the White House has said it was unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the world\'s seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.     The officials added that while the curbs complicated U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt  Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.     Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for Japan\'s failure to honor commitments to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs and to open its own market to U.S. goods.     The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television sets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.     Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted as soon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adhering to the pact.  \n',trade
'U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact, according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy research groups.     The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross border trade would benefit both countries.     But Cato chairman William Niskanen added \"the two nations\' generally harmonious trade relations are probably not sustainable without a new agreement.\"     The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers remaining between their two countries.     The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining remained.     Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and this could hit some Canadian trade practices.     He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.     Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S. exports to Canada.     A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.     It would also increase the gross national products of both countries.     Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.  \n',trade
'The United Arab Emirates (UAE) recorded a 1986 trade surplus of 12.2 billion dirhams, narrowing from 30.2 billion in 1985, the central bank\'s latest bulletin shows.     The central bank said the lower surplus was mainly due to the decline in the value of exports and reexports to 37.2 billion dirhams from 54.2 billion in 1985. This reflected the decline in oil prices last year and difficulties in marketing UAE oil, the central bank added.     The surplus on the current account narrowed to 6.8 billion dirhams from 25.5 billion in 1985. The overall balance showed a surplus of 4.8 billion after 2.6 billion in 1985.  \n',trade
'Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the global trading system.     He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.     The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it trade in agriculture and services such as banking.     Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.     The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and many services.     Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli pacts \"other countries have realized that if they want to continue to have access to the world\'s largest market, they had better get serious about improving the GATT.\"     The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially increase the gross national products in both countries.     Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.     Yeutter said, \"increasing trade is one of the keys to enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.\"     He said, \"a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries that need to increase trade in order to better their standards of living.\"     Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to protectionism.     He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions against nations with large trade surpluses with the United States if the countries practiced unfair trade.     The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still rising.     Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President Reagan\'s efforts to liberalize the world trade.     Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.     He said, \"President Reagan will veto any bill that contains serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.\"  \n',trade

'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was almost sure Japan would not retaliate against tariffs President Reagan slapped on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese electronic goods today.     \"I\'d say it\'s 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) will not provoke a retaliation on American products,\" Yeutter told Cable News Network.     \"Japan has far too much at stake in this relationship (with the United States) to seriously entertain thoughts of retaliation,\" Yeutter said.     Earlier today, Reagan  imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan\'s alleged violation of a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade.     Yeutter did say that U.S. farm products would be targeted if Tokyo decided to hit back.     \"If they (Japan) were to retaliate, it would probably be on something like American agricultural products,\" he said.     \"But I really think the chances of that happening are between slim and none,\" he added.  \n',trade
'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.     Asked in a television interview what the chance was for Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese electronic exports, he said \"slim to none.\"     Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to retaliate for Japan\'s failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.     Yeutter, on the NBC program \"Today,\" said the United States did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.     He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take time to monitor any compliance.     Asked how long that would take, he said \"We want to see a pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would take a few weeks.\"     Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods because the items selected are also readily available from other countries and manufacturers.     He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.     \"It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that full well,\" Yeutter said.     He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but \"that\'s more of a paper kind of exercise and I don\'t really expect to see any adverse impact on U.S. trade.\"     Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.     He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a major issue, would be productive but \"I don\'t see any practical way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his visit.\"  \n',trade
'National Bank economic data for 1986 shows that Yugoslavia\'s trade deficit grew, the inflation rate rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and the value of the dinar fell.     The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.     Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.     Yugoslavia\'s balance of payments surplus with the convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344 mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.     Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank\'s data showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.     Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.     Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages were too high given the level of productivity.     Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.     Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9 billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs abroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.     The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard currencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against the Swiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar, 46.2 pct.  \n',trade
'Developing countries said the European Community (EC) would breach two international agreements if it went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.     Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the exports of 26 ACP countries.     They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect trade between the two sides.     They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.     The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could raise up to two billion Ecus a year.     EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax, are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on June 15.     Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its member country exports.     \"We can\'t believe the EC would willingly take measures to undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these measures,\" Wilson said.     The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it is approved.     Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only \"as a very last resort,\" but added that the ACP is in touch with other countries which oppose the plan.     Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats.     Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast, Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.  \n',veg-oil
'A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for soybeans should help boost 1987 U.S. Soybean exports to Taiwan, a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers tolds.     He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by the cabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.

Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from the U.S. And the rest from South America.
