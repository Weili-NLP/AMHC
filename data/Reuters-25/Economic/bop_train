'Australia\'s current deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in February from 1.23 billion (revised from 1.29 billion) in January, the Statistics Bureau said.     This compared with an 897 mln dlr shortfall a year earlier.     February merchandise trade recorded a 42 mln dlr surplus against a 246 mln shortfall (revised from 287 mln) in January and a 162 mln deficit in February 1986.     The current account deficit fell at the lower end of the range of forecasts of 700 mln to one billion dlrs made by market economists yesterday.     February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion dlrs from 2.74 billion (revised from 2.72 billion) in January and 2.54 billion a year earlier while FOB imports fell to 2.77 billion from 2.99 billion (revised from 3.01 billion) against 2.70 billion a year earlier, the Bureau said.     It said a four pct decline in rural exports, despite an 11 pct rise in wheat exports, was more than offset by a seven pct rise in non-rural exports, notably minerals and fuels.     On the import side, the main decreases were falls of 17 pct in machinery and transport equipment and 21 pct in fuels, the Bureau said.     The net services deficit narrowed to 146 mln dlrs from 253 mln (revised from 268 mln) in January and 192 mln a year earlier, the Bureau said.     This made a sharply lower deficit of 104 mln dlrs on the balance of goods and services against deficits of 499 mln in January and 354 mln a year earlier.     Deficit on net income and unrequited transfers was 646 mln dlrs against 736 mln in January and 543 mln a year earlier.     Official capital transactions in February showed a surplus of 786 mln dlrs against a 2.56 billion surplus in January and a 505 mln surplus a year earlier.     Non-official capital and balancing item showed a 36 mln dlr deficit against a 1.33 billion deficit in January and a 392 mln surplus in February 1986, the Bureau said.     The cumulative current account deficit for the first eight months of fiscal 1986/87 ending June 30 widened to 9.37 billion dlrs from 9.32 billion a year earlier.     The cumulative trade deficit narrowed to 2.09 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion and the services deficit to 2.25 billion from 2.75 billion but the transfers deficit widened to 5.03 billion from 4.36 billion. The cumulative official capital surplus narrowed to 2.90 billion dlrs from 3.86 billion.  \n',bop
'Australia\'s current account deficit for February is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln and one billion dlrs, from the unrevised January level of 1.29 billion, market economists polled bys said.     Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow.     The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January, after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598 mln dlrs.     As an example they quoted wheat export volume, which rose about 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January.     A lack of aircraft imports in February should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit, the economists said.     Other positive influences on the current account balance should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of certain official aid payments, they said.     They said the Australian dollar, which last week touched an eight-month high of 0.6900 U.S. Dlrs but is now around the 0.6800 level, should not react adversely to the figures unless the current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs.  \n',bop
'Canada\'s current account deficit widened to a seasonally adjusted 2.27 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter from a deficit of 1.94 billion dlrs in the third, Statistics Canada said.     The shortfall for the full year rose to 8.81 billion dlrs from 1985\'s 584 mln dlr deficit, the federal agency said.     The agency said the rise in the merchandise surplus, to 2.77 billion dlrs from 2.20 billion dlrs in the third quarter, was more than offset by high deficits in servicies and investment. The total non-merchandise deficit grew to 5.04 billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs.     The current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1985.     In the capital account, not seasonally adjusted, there was a total net inflow of 4.76 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, up from a net inflow of 3.22 billion dlrs in the third quarter quarter.     The total net capital inflow rose to 13.74 billion dlrs in 1986 from 7.68 billion dlr in 1985.  \n',bop
'Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said today\'s downgrading of Denmark\'s credit rating by Standard and Poor\'s Corp should not be over-dramatised.     Standard and Poor\'s said it had downgraded the Kingdom of Denmark\'s long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, following the country\'s loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983.     \"This change is regrettable but there is no reason to dramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor\'s defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top AAA rating,\" Simonsen said in a statement.     \"The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing capability is unlikely to be very great. But if, against expectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external account deficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and capability,\" he added.     \"Standard &amp; Poor\'s has noted that in 1986 there was a series of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and encourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect.     \"If and when it becomes necessary, the government will be ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives as it has in the past,\" Simonsen said.    Standard and Poor\'s said weaker international competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external debt.     The external current account deficit rose to a record preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in 1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns, according to government statistics.     Government economists forecast that the external current account deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year.     Denmark\'s net foreign debt rose to 129 pct of total exports in 1986 from 83 pct in 1983, S and P said.  \n',bop
'The Dutch current account surplus fell 5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billion guilders, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.     The surplus is expected to fall further in 1987, the statement said, but gave no details. Earlier today, the official planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus to fall to six billion guilders during 1987.     The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6 billion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining terms of exchange, while more goods were imported as consumer spending and investment increased.     While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion guilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay between the fall in oil and gas prices.     The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on invisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the Finance Ministry said, noting the surplus on transport services was reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price falls.     The fourth quarter current account showed a deficit, for the first time since 1980, of 700 mln guilders, it said.  \n',bop
'China\'s foreign debt reached 27 billion dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to short-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign bankers and Chinese officials tolds.     Foreign bankers said China\'s total debt rose sharply from an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low, between eight and 10 pct.     China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said.     Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on 1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct.     Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.     A Western banker said China\'s portfolio contains too much short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive low interest rates in the Japanese market.     The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.     A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the country\'s total debt at about 30 pct.     The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.     \"Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China, which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread,\" he said.     The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is in part a result of China\'s inexperience in the foreign capital markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.     \"Officials do not think of China but of their own department or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the full backing of the People\'s Republic of China,\" he said.     \"The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to exercise indirect controls,\" he said.     The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the past six weeks that China\'s foreign borrowing will not be affected by a drive against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a phrase meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16.     A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China\'s foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially stated figure of 10 billion dlrs.     \"The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in advance of an announcement the reserves were down,\" he said.     The banker said such buying has not been going on. \"Things are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in 1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development.\"     Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985.     A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official said this year\'s outlook for exports, which account for more than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier than a year ago.     The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It was quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago.     The official said China has taken measures to improve its export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and the establishment of export production bases.     \"We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year,\" he added.     Official estimates put China\'s 1986 export losses from the drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs.     A Western diplomat said China\'s foreign debt needs careful management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six to eight pct.     \"We base our assessment not on China\'s foreign exchange reserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a company on its performance, not its bank account,\" he said.     He said China performed very well in the export field last year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have few difficulties in increasing its borrowing.  \n',bop
'The net inflow of foreign investment into Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billion a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said.     The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08 billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billion turnaround in direct investment.     The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a 520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account of government foreign currency borrowings, it said.     Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billion dlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal in the third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourth quarter of 1985, the Bureau said.     It said the major part of the turnaround reflected an injection of funds, estimated at around 700 mln dlrs, associated with the previously reported restructuring of the Australian operations of General Motors Corp GM.     GM used the funds to pay out or take over certain Australian liabilities of its local unit General Motors-Holden\'s Ltd, it said.     However, net borrowings remained the major part of total inflow, accounting for 6.16 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter against 3.88 billion in the third quarter and 4.03 billion a year earlier, the Bureau said.     Net official borrowings comprised 1.52 billion dlrs against a net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mln inflow a year earlier.     Total private and semi-public authority net borrowings rose to 4.64 billion dlrs from 4.42 billion in the third quarter and 3.51 billion a year earlier.  \n',bop
'The French 1986 current account balance of payments surplus has been revised slightly upwards to 25.8 billion francs from the 25.4 billion franc figure announced last month, the Finance Ministry said.     This compares with a 1.5 billion deficit in 1985, and while it is the first surplus since 1979, is substantially lower than the 50 billion surplus forecast by the previous socialist government before they lost office in March last year.     Net long-term capital outflows rose sharply to 70.5 billion francs last year from 8.8 billion in 1985, largely due to a major program of foreign debt repayment, the ministry said.     In the fourth quarter alone the unadjusted surplus rose to 14.1 billion francs from 6.6 billion the previous quarter, but the adjusted surplus fell to 7.4 billion from 9.1 billion.     Fourth quarter medium and long-term foreign debt repayments exceeded new credits by 11 billion francs.  \n',bop
'France\'s current account payments surplus slipped to a provisional 300 mln francs, seasonally adjusted, in January from a downward revised surplus of 3.8 billion in December, the Finance Ministry said.     The December figure was revised from a provisional 4.8 billion franc surplus reported a month ago.     On an unadjusted basis, January payments showed a 5.2 billion franc deficit after a revised 7.1 billion December surplus. The December unadjusted surplus was revised down from a provisional 8.2 billion.     The Ministry said trade, measured on balance of payments criteria, showed an unadjusted 7.1 billion franc January deficit while services showed a 3.7 billion surplus.     Other items, mainly including unilateral transfers, showed a 1.8 billion deficit.     The current account showed an adjusted surplus of 6.1 billion francs in January last year, and an unadjusted deficit of one billion.

'West Germany\'s current account surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in February from a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, a spokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said.     The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4 billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.     The Statistics Office had originally put the January current account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.     The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billion mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the current account surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus recorded in February 1986.     A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the February current account surplus compared with January was due to seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current account figures are seasonally adjusted.     February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled 32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986 but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.     Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56 billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct compared with January.     The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate the real change in exports and imports in February. But for comparison purposes it noted that in January the average value of imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average value of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.     Within the current account, the services account had 300 mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark surplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark deficit.     Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in value terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a year earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks, a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.     The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for January/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1 billion marks in the year-ago period.     The cumulative current account surplus for January and February 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion marks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.     Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as seasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlier this week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against January while export prices were unchanged.     \"The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend that is not expected to change for several months at least,\" said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987 as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record 112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.     An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) in Frankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a more accurate picture of West Germany\'s trade position.     He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January and February together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus posted in November and December.     \"The trend is clearly lower,\" he said.     This economist, who declined to be named, said the February rise was also partly explained by special factors in January, when there had been a number of public holidays as well as extremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.  \n',bop
'The inflow of long-term capital into West Germany slumped to 606 mln marks in February from January\'s record 11.91 billion, with foreign purchases of German bonds and shares declining sharply, the Bundesbank said.     While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth of German bonds in February after 13 billion in January, they sold a net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of public authorities after sales worth 300 mln in January.     With German investors\' purchases of foreign securities steady around 1.3 billion marks, only 2.2 billion marks were imported through securities transactions, after 11.2 billion.     Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60 billion marks in February after 2.83 billion in January.     There was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short-term capital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January.     Banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds while domestic companies increased their short-term financial assets abroad by 700 mln. But public authorities received some one billion marks from abroad, the Bundesbank said in a statement.     Combining long and short term capital outflows, West Germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks in February against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January.     The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widened to 10.45 billion marks in February from January\'s 7.20 billion.     Taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. In terms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing of the surplus was progressing, the bank said.     Germany\'s current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion marks in February from 4.79 billion in January, but was down on the 7.26 billion figure for February 1986. Seasonally adjusted, the February current account surplus narrowed against January.     While exports in February fell a half pct against the same month last year, imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to the drop in prices. Exports grew three pct in volume and imports two pct.     In the balance of services, a fall in net investment income led to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln mark surplus in January.     The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion marks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3 billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the European Community budget.  \n',bop

'The Australian dollar rose more than 40 points and money market interest rates retreated on the better than expected improvement in the February current account deficit, but economists and dealers were cautious about identifying it as the start of a downward trend.     The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in February from 1.23 billion in January. It hit 13.82 billion dlrs in 1985/86 to end-June.     The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded as high as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69.     \"It\'s got 69 cents written all over it,\" one dealer said.     Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30 points to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release.     The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one billion dlrs for March.     Banque National de Paris BNPP.A senior dealer Peter Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and interest rates were too high for import substitution and export industries.     Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875 and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow.     Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at 2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January.     But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal exports remained poor. \"We should remember we are paying something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near term,\" Buttrose said.     Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln dlrs, and added \"Any figure under a billion dollars will be acceptable (to the markets).\"     ANZ Banking Group Ltd ANZA.S senior economist Ian Little said the big question was whether the improvement in exports could be sustained. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion dlrs from a revised 2.74 billion in January.     Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news, with 90-day bank bill yields falling to 16.42-16.45 pct from early highs of 16.50 and yields yesterday as high as 16.65.     Longer term yields fell with 10-year bonds at 13.66/68 pct from 13.74 before the release and highs of 13.87 yesterday.

'Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said.     He tolds the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985, which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.     Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year.     This year\'s target of 20 pct \"might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful,\" he said.     Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government\'s economic planning, said Turkey\'s creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.     \"We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years,\" he added.     His comment echoed last October\'s Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said Ankara\'s case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.     \"In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit,\" he said.     Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits.     Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.     \"We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,\" he said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986.     More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage exports, and production incentives were being considered.     \"We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned,\" Tigrel said.     He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible.  \n',bop
'The U.S. current account deficit widened to a record 36.84 billion dlrs on a balance of payments basis in the October-December fourth quarter of 1986 from a revised 35.29 billion dlrs in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said.     Previously, the department said the third-quarter deficit was 36.28 billion dlrs.     For the full year 1986, the current account, a broad measure of trade performance, was in deficit a record 140.57 billion dlrs after a 117.68 billion dlr deficit in 1985.     The department said an increase in the merchandise trade deficit during the fourth quarter to 38.4 billion dlrs from 37.1 billion dlrs in the third quarter was the main reason for the worsening deficit.     Net service receipts declined to 5.5 billion dlrs in the final quarter from six billion dlrs in the third quarter.     The current account includes trade in merchandise and services as well as U.S. financial transactions with the rest of the world.     The department said the merchandise trade deficit for all of 1986 grew to 147.7 billion from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985.     Net service receipts were 22.3 billion dlrs in 1986, compared with 21.7 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said.     Net unilateral transfers during the fourth quarter last year, covering foreign aid and government pensions, were down to 3.9 billion dlrs from 4.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter because of fewer U.S. government grants to Mideast countries.     Liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S. banks rose 35.3 billion dlrs between October and December after increasing 30.1 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     For the full year, these liabilities grew 77.4 billion dlrs after rising by 40.4 billion dlrs in 1985.     The department said inflows were boosted in the fourth quarter by international activities of Japanese banks and strong demand within the United States to finance acquisitions.     Net foreign sales of U.S. Treasury securities by foreigners were 2.7 billion dlrs in the quarter after purchases of 500 mln dlrs in the third quarter.     Net foreign purchases of securities other than U.S. Treasury securities in the fourth quarter were 11.8 billion dlrs, compared with 17.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     For all 1986, foreign purchases of securities excluding U.S. Treasury securities were a record 70.7 billion dlrs, surpassing the previous record 50.9 billion dlr total in 1985.    Claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks in the fourth quarter rose 29.9 billion dlrs after a 19.3 billion dlr third-quarter increase.     U.S. sales of foreign securities rose to 2.7 billion dlrs from 300 mln dlrs in the third quarter because of a sharp selloff of foreign stocks and bonds, the department said.     Outflows for U.S. direct investment abroad fell to 5.7 billion dlrs from eight billion dlrs in the third quarter.     Foreign direct investment in the United States increased 14.4 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.6 billion dlrs in the previous quarter, because of stepped-up acquisitions, the department said.     Foreign official assets in the United States increased 800 mln dlrs between October and December after rising 15.4 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     For the full year 1986, foreign official assets grew 33.4 billion dlrs after a 1985 decrease of 1.9 billion dlrs as foreign monetary authorities intervened heavily in exchange markets late in the year as the dollar fell, commerce said.  \n',bop
'The U.S. merchandise trade deficit on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said.     The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15 billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.     For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said.     During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78 billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.     The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and insurance.     The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose 1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.     Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18 pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars and a nine pct decrease from Japan.     On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.     Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were limited by drought.     Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700 mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200 mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.

In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3 billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.     Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6 billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs from 26.41 dlrs.     Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell 27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and soybeans nine pct.     The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1 billion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe increased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs.  \n',bop
