'Momentum in th U.S. economy may be picking up given solid across-the board increases in the February U.S. employment report, economists said.     U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February, twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a 319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 448,000 increase.     \"Even if you look at January and February together, this is still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in the market,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.     Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much larger gains in February U.S. production and income than previously forecast.     The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from 34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose 0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since November 1966, the Commerce Department said.     \"The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7 pct,\" said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4 pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.     Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour in February from 8.83 dlrs in January.     \"Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means we\'ll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis the wage and salary disbursement,\" he said.     Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.     He said the February employment gains are consistent with his firm\'s first quarter U.S. real gross national product growth forecast of 3.7 pct.     Economists agreed that the employment data were negative for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy and no easing in the Federal Reserve\'s monetary policy. But most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.     \"This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider easing,\" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.     \"It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,\" he said. \"If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so, but it\'s most likely they\'ll sit and wait.\"     \"The data have not been uniform,\" Stone added. \"Durable goods were weak in January and now employment is strong.\"     In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct, followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S. retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap widened to 14.8 billion dlrs.     \"Things just aren\'t adding up,\" said Steve Slifer of Lehman Goverment Securities Inc. \"Consumer spending, capital spending, goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first quarter GNP growth of one pct,\" he said.     \"The employment and production data point to a big inventory build-up, but that\'s what we thought in the fourth quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.\"     Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000 in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery industries returning to work.     Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains have resulted from an improving trade outlook.     Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S. trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve in the first quarter.     \"Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter, but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show that trade is improving,\" Benderley said.     \"The economy is moving between extremes,\" he said. \"Some reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.\"     A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater part of February\'s employment gain. Retail services employment rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in January, previously reported at 166,000.     Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 142,000 gain.     The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at 6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since March 1980, the Commerce Department noted.     \"The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,\" Carson said. \"This takes away the Fed\'s flexibility to ease, but there\'s no reason to tighten. It\'s way too early for that.\"         \n',jobs

'The government announced a three billion franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation among political and economic analysts that it is positioning itself for a period of economic reflation.     The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe Seguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc contingency fund announced on February 25.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a reflationary program.     Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third of French unemployed, government figures show.     The main measures of the employment program give employers financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term unemployed return to the labour market.     Training subsidies and exemptions from social security contributions are the main incentives for employers.     \"Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour market and that\'s why the proposals...Are costly,\" an aide to Seguin said.     The analysts said speculation the government is considering a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.     He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out economic stimulation despite the government\'s revision of its 1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.     Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin\'s remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate the economy through a boost to consumer spending although government policy allowed for increased industrial investment from the proceeds of France\'s five-year privatisation plan.     The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt and providing state enterprises with fresh capital.     Some political analysts said Baudouin\'s comments possibly reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on social issues ahead of next year\'s presidential elections.      Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with labour.      Officials said that after the success of the privatisation of Cie de Saint Gobain SGEP.PA and Cie Financiere de Paribas PARI.PA the government had decided to speed up its five-year privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in 1988.     The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted revenue to boost industrial and research investment and spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway network.    The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by improving the competitiveness of French industry.     The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of State.  \n',jobs
'The 1992 deadline for abolishing economic barriers within the European Community should help French economic growth and create jobs, president of the French employers\' federation CNPF Francois Perigot said.     \"Having a market at our disposal which is as homogeneous and accessible as that of Europe is an incredible piece of luck,\" he told Le Figaro in an interview.     He said that the majority of French business leaders were enthusiastic about the abolition of barriers and saw it as an opportunity rather than a danger for their companies.     \"It can permit us to return to a growth rate which is much better than we could achieve in isolation.

'The government plans to go ahead with a three billion franc package to help the long-term unemployed, with the aim of guaranteeing social security payments to everyone becoming redundant, government officials said.     At present only about one-third of the country\'s 2.6 mln jobless, corresponding to 10.9 pct of the workforce, receive unemployment benefit.     Prime Minister Jacques Chirac told a television interviewer, \"As soon as the law is approved, and it will be in a matter of weeks, all workers made redundant will have the right to social benefits.\"     The money, which will be used to alleviate unemployment through retraining or project finance, will come from a 7.5 billion franc government fund set up last month to finance spending on special areas of concern.

Labour Office President Heinrich Franke, announcing the figures, said the hesitant decline in the unadjusted jobless total reflected continuing bad weather, slack activity in the capital goods sector and structural changes in the coal and steel industry.     In a separate statement, the Federal Statistics Office said the rise in the overall number of people in employment had slowed in February.     The Office said that, according to estimates for February, 25.7 mln people were in work, a rise of around 240,000 or 0.9 pct compared with the same month in 1986.     It noted that in January the year-on-year rise was 250,000 or 1.0 pct and the number in work stood at 25.78 mln.

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.     The yen\'s surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said.     Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd\'s economics department.
