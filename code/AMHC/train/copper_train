'Chilean left-wing leaders were elected by the copper workers union for the first time since the left-wing government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in a 1973 coup.      Nicanor Araya, a member of the Popular Democratic Movement (MDP), was named president of the Chilean Confederation of Copperworkers (CTC), which groups 22,000 workers employed in the state-owned copper mines, union officials said.     Other members of the MDP, which includes the communist party and a faction of the socialist party, took five of the principal positions on the union\'s directorate.     The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) produces around 90 pct of the country\'s copper output of some one mln tonnes per year. Chile is the world\'s leading copper exporter and sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income.     The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union\'s directorate in elections earlier this month, with the christian democratic party holding five and the remainder being won by independents.     But the left-wing was left in control of the union after the christian democrats and independents failed to reach agreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrew from negotiations.     Union elections were called following the resignation of former president Rodolfo Seguel last October.     Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile\'s best-known union leader, said he was forced to step down after repeated court actions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating.     The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union national workers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCO following a strike in 1983.     The strike, the only copper industry stoppage staged in the past 13 years, marked the start of a wave of protests against the military rule of President Augusto Pinochet.      CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as union leader when no longer employed by the company.  \n',copper
'Representatives of the International Wrought Copper Council (IWCC) and major copper producers have told the London Metal Exchange (LME) a clear statement of its forward strategy would lead to a better understanding between industry and the LME.     In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new clearing house system, industry expressed grave concern about latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which will retain the prompt date settlement basis.     Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change (the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamental change in the function of the LME and in its service to the industry, the release said.     By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from non-trade orientated markets such as Comex.     The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should take a higher priority over customer satisfaction, industry delegates said.     The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on May 29. But it had indicated that consideration would be given in due course to the cash clearing proposal, made by Amalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week.     A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance of permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry fears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of review and change, the press release said.  \n',copper

'Finland\'s mining and metals group Outokumpu Oy OUTO.HE, which last week reported a 1986 loss of 83 mln markka after three successive years of profits, said it restructured its key copper processing division in an attempt to rationalize production and improve profitability.     Outokumpu\'s Managing Director Pertti Voutilainen told a news conference the reorganization involved a split of the division into a new independent division with six profit centres.     Outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and taxes of 83 mln markka after a profit of 355 mln in 1985. It had profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss, 171.2 mln, in 1982.     Outokumpu acquired two Swedish copper manufacturers in January 1986, Metallverken Ab and Wirsbo Bruks Ab, that were merged into its copper processing division.     The division had a turnover of 3.2 billion markka last year, 42 pct of Outokumpu\'s group turnover of 7.58 billion.

'The Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd RGFJ.S (RGC) Mt Lyell copper mine in Tasmania will stay open for an extra five years following a new aid package from the state government, RGC said in a statement.     The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40 series stopes were mined, but will now stay open until the deeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994.     The Australian dollar\'s fall since 1985 also improved the local dollar copper price, making the company profitable and justifying the mining of deeper reserves at a copper grade of about 1.95 pct against about 1.60 pct now, the firm said.     Ore output will be cut, but the higher grades will keep contained-copper output at current levels of about 24,000 tonnes a year, it said. Capital expenditure of about 18 mln dlrs will be required over the life of the new plan, RGC said.     The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC, a major employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coast of Tasmania.     The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10 mln dlrs in aid. The new package includes an eight mln dlr advance to RGC at the long-term bond rate, power concessions and deferred royalties and payroll taxes.  \n',copper

'Zambia has stopped sending its copper exports through South Africa, the official Times of Zambia said.     The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as saying the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) was diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa, but it did not say which alternative routes were being used.     ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, but Standwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), tolds recently virtually all Zambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA line to Dar es Salaam for the last three months.     During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped through Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only other available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said.     Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambian mineral ore, the line\'s record for any one month period, he added.     Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to 98 pct of Zambia\'s foreign exchange earnings and President Kenneth Kaunda tolds in a recent interview it was vital for his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding the traditional route through South Africa.     Referring to Zambia\'s preparations for a possible cut in economic links with South Africa, Kaunda tolds in an interview on March 1, \"My main concern, of course, is the mines because whatever happens we must continue to run the mines.\"     According to Mapara, TAZARA handled 1.1 mln tonnes of freight last year and is still working well below its present 1.4 mln capacity. Kaunda said that once preparations had been completed for evacuating Zambia\'s mineral exports on safe and dependable routes his government would look to increase its usage of TAZARA for other types of cargo.     The 1986 annual report of Zambia\'s state-run Metal Marketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country\'s metal exports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus 79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fell to 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985.     Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia\'s export routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed reservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira ports to handle all of Zambia\'s mineral exports, even if they could be hauled there by train.     \"The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form handle the huge exports of Zambian copper,\" one western diplomat said.     \"A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets could be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports which lack the facilities and space to handle the copper tonnage,\" he added.  \n',copper

A spokesman for the government-controlled mining company said the country\'s cobalt production fell 24 pct to 879 tonnes over the same period, while cobalt sales rose 92 pct to 1,734 tonnes.

Chitambala declined to say what volume of copper and other minerals were being shipped through these two ports, but he said there had not been any problem with the new arrangements.     \"So far our copper has been reaching its destinations without hindrance,\" he told the Times.     The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambia exported 100,000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and 17,000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986. Diplomatic sources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia\'s ability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam without causing massive bottlenecks at the ports.
