'The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover the sale of 2,750 head of dairy cattle to the Canary Islands, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The cattle are for delivery May, 1987-October, 1988, it said.     The bonus was 1,379.00 dlrs per head and was made to Holstein-Friesian, Inc and will be paid in the form of commodities from the CCC inventory.     An additional 175 headed of dairy cattle for still available to the Canary Islands under the Export Enhancement Program initiative announced July 28, 1986, it said.  \n',livestock
'The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has transferred 12.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees previously earmarked for sales of U.S. hatching eggs and 7.0 mln dlrs in guarantees for breeder livestock to increase coverage on sales of U.S. protein concentrates to Iraq, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The action was taken at the request of Iraq\'s State Trade Organization for Grains and Foodstuffs and reduces the line for hatching eggs to zero and the line for breeder livestock from 15.0 mln dlrs to 8.0 mln dlrs, the department said.     The guarantee line for sales of protein concentrates has been increased from 25.0 mln dlrs to 44.0 mln dlrs, it said.      \n',livestock
'Zimbabwe\'s beef exports to the European Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.     The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.     The outbreak in the country\'s main ranching province has already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export revenue.     \"The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of beef exports,\" one industry source said yesterday.      Commenting on EC policy, he explained, \"Depending on the seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are still awaiting their decision,\" he added, asking not to be identified.     Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.     Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.  \n',livestock
'All steers imported into the United States from Mexico must now be branded with the letter M on the right jaw, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said the branding is necessary to improve surveillance for bovine tuberculosis because it provides a permanent way to identify Mexican steers.     The requirement is not expected to affect the number of Mexican steers imported into the United States and the brand will be applied before the animals arrive at U.S. ports of entry.     Last November, the Mexican Government authorized an export quota of nearly 1.1 mln head of live cattle for the 1986/87 season (Aug-July), most of which goes to the United States.  \n',livestock
'An Iowa State University study showed pork contains considerably less fat than indicated by long-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said.     Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart Association guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained less than six pct fat, the NPPC said.     Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.     Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy between the study and the USDA handbook.     \"Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago, thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,\" Kline said.     The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money, evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat, moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.  \n',livestock
'The U.S. meat and poultry inspection programs are incapable of protecting consumers from contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and consumers charged.     \"The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated meat,\" Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.     \"The American consumer has little reason to feel confident about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him today,\" said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute.     \"Company management is less concerned about the risk to health than about raising plant output and company profits,\" Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.     Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose violations of federal law, demonstrating a \"serious breakdown in the entire inspection system.\"     Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being contaminated by \"intestines dragging in a water trough used to flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit, chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow their noses.\"     Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended the government\'s program, calling it \"one of the most respected public health programs in the world.\"     FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5 billion chicken and turkeys every year.     Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in the meat and poultry supply has increased.     He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time and much money to contain the growing problem.     Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.     The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20 years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.     \"We certainly really have not found an effective means of turning this disease around,\" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)     The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for detecting microoganisms.     But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls would cost too much.     \"Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and economical meat supply for consumers,\" Stanley Emerling, executive vice president of the National Association of Meat Purveyors, said.     Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at certain plants \"voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor legal recourse.\"     Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.  \n',livestock
'U.S. Agriculture Department inspectors have refused entry to parts of two lots of Australian beef because of pesticide residues, a spokeswoman for the department said.     She said USDA has notified Australia, which assured it that stricter controls would be implemented.     The Australian government had already imposed residue controls and it is believed the meat with the presticide residues was already in the pipeline before the controls were put in place, the spokeswoman said.     There have been five other cases of Australian meat which had residue levels above U.S. allowable limits this year, she said.  \n',livestock
'The U.S. Agriculture Department is preparing a proposal that would require all foreign meat products to be inspected at their point of arrival in the United States, a USDA official said.     Donald Houston, administrator of USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, told a House Agriculture subcommittee USDA was developing a proposed change in regulations that would put an end to the current practice of permitting foreign meat products to be unloaded at one port and inspected at another port.     Houston said the requirement would be phased in over several years to \"avoid disruptions and economic hardship.\"  \n',livestock
'West Virginia has been declared free of tuberculosis and brucellosis from its cattle population, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     It said a state is recognized as tuberculosis-free if no case of the disease is diagnosed for at least five years and if the state complies with the uniform methods and rules of the state-federal cooperative eradication program.     To achieve brucellosis-free status, a state\'s cattle population must remain uninfected for the previous 12 months.     There are 33 states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands, classified as free of bovine tuberculosis and 24 states, plus Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which have eradicated brucellosis. Only 20 states and the U.S. Virgin islands have eradicated both diseases, it noted.  \n',livestock
