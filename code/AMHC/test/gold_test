'Homestake Mining Co is considering acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company\'s exploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger tolds in an interview.     Conger said, \"the move to consider acquisitions represents a change in the company\'s acquistions policy.\"     Conger said all of Homestake\'s current cash position of 120 mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition, Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which have not been drawn on and could be used to finance an acquisition, he said.     Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs.     Conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than last year\'s spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year\'s 9.6 pct.     Conger said he sees Homestake\'s 1987 gold production about the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.     However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year\'s 45,400 ounces due to start-up production problems.     He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400 U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.  \n',gold
'The elimination of price limits on precious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange in New York appears to be having little effect on the market, analysts said.     \"There is nothing apparent from the change,\" said William O\'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc. \"The market has not approached the old price limits and trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,\" he added.     Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.     On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the two contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver futures at the end of April caused severe disruptions.     During the last week of April, silver futures traded up and down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts said.  As a result, Elders\' O\'Neill said, there was much confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.     The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.     Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.     O\'Neill said the elimination of price limits on all COMEX metals futures would add caution to trading since all contracts could move any distance.     \"This is amore realistic approach because the metals market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,\" O\'Neill said.     Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic buying or selling  and contribute to more orderly markets.      \n',gold

On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations, which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting of all daily limits, effective today.

Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.

'Gold bullion continued to move higher supported by good general buying and was fixed this morning at 436.50 dlrs, 268.368 stg, an ounce, up from Friday\'s close of 432.00/50, dealers said.     The setting was the highest since October 8 as gold built on Friday\'s gains, which had been based on the weakness of the dollar and fears of a trade war between the United States and Japan.     It opened slightly firmer at 433.50/434.00 and moved up steadily during the morning supported by commission house and trade buying, dealers said.     Dealers said there was resistance around 440.00 but with sentiment still firm some traders believe the rally may even take gold as high as 500 dlrs.     Platinum was fixed this morning at 583.50 dlrs an ounce, up from Friday\'s close of 578.50/580.50, and also the highest setting since October.  \n',gold

'Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd RGFJ.S (RGC) and explorer City Resources Ltd have agreed in principle on a joint venture to re-examine the Bulolo alluvial gold field in Papua New Guinea, City Resources said.     City Resources would progressively earn up to 66.66 pct of RGC\'s Prospecting Authority 585, which covers all the field, by spending a total of 6.5 mln kina, it said in a statement.     It said it believed Bulolo was not fully exploited in the past, noting the literature refers to heavy gold losses in tailings during dredging from 1931 to 1967 which produced a total of 2.1 mln ounces.     City Resources also said previous dredging was only carried out to a depth of 36 metres and high grade gold values are reported to at least 60 metres in the central part of the Bulolo Valley and possibly as deep as 90 metres.     In its productive life, recovered average grade at Bulolo was 0.3 rpt 0.3 grams a tonne from some 207 mln cubic metres of gravel, it said. City Resources will act as operator.     The Bulolo field, in Morobe Province, was the first successful gold mining operation of Placer Development Ltd after it was floated in Canada in 1926. It operated the field until dredging ceased in 1967.  \n',gold

'Mining group Boliden AB said it had agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to exploit one of the world\'s richest deposits of the metal.     Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson tolds the Swedish group would  be responsible for the technical side of the operation and would have no control over the product itself.     He said one option under discussion for refining the gold ore would be to ship it to Boliden\'s Ronnskar copper smelter in northern Sweden.     Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it was strategically important since it increased Boliden\'s presence in Saudi Arabia.     \"Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the future,\" he said.     The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab in the west of the country and should open in the first half of 1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.     Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi Arabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to open in modern times.     \"This is a breakthrough for Boliden\'s sales of mining technology and knowhow,\" said the group\'s chief executive, Kjell Nilsson.  \n',gold
