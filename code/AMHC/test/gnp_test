The organisation\'s latest half-yearly report says Gross Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.     The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.     The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.     While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year, however, the report revises downwards the OECD\'s earlier growth forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.     The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is struggling to recover from a major economic crisis.     The country\'s GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year, should again show growth over the next two years, rising by 0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.  \n',gnp
'West German Economics Minister Martin Bangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country\'s leading economic research institutes for early introduction of a major tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.     In a statement reacting to the five institutes\' joint spring report, Bangemann said that as far as the call for bringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --     \"The government points out that the positive effects for growth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budget deficit) must not be allowed to be endangered.\"     Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned for 1988 had already been increased.     Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987, with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.     Bangemann said \"The government, agreeing with the majority, sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for exports expressed by the minority.\"     He said there was reason to believe that export demand would start to rise in the course of the year, partly because of a further increase in world trade.  \n',gnp
'A trade-led boom in the U.S. is unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its latest economic report.     Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year, after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.     As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5 pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke, the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.     \"Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause a falloff in the growth of disposable income,\" Van Dyke said.     Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8 pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.     The report was released before the Commerce Department reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May, after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with a 0.6 pct increase the month before.     The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9 pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.     This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income  growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.     As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.     The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in 1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.     \"For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988 or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,\" Van Dyke said.     Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an improvement in trade. \"However, with protectionist attitudes on the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,\" he added.  \n',gnp
'The Philippines\' first quarter growth figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose Fernandez said in an interview.     The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter from a year earlier.     \"I don\'t see anything on the horizon that should cut it (growth) short,\" Fernandez said.      NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year\'s GNP growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.     \"Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block,\" Fernandez said.     \"I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power, showed that the economy was on a different track from last year,\" he said.     Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it could drop off in the third quarter.     He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in 1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.     \"That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,\" he said.     He said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.     The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling 58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988. Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or August to review performance in the January-June period.     He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs. Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.     \"It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA (official development assistance) accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line,\" he said.     It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.     The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28 billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.     Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984 to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in October last year, had almost been completed.     He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well. \"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,\" he said.     Commenting on the country\'s foreign debt Fernandez said, \"I think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable.\"     The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach 29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.     NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.     Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.     Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country\'s exports more competitive.     \"By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country\'s trading partners,\" he said.     On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the Code.     The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has been delayed by objections from some business groups.     \"I think any central bank, certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and I\'m not about to do that,\" Fernandez said.     \"It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free,\" he said.     \"We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external availabilities simply by servicing our debts.\"  \n',gnp
'Economic growth will remain sluggish in the Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may rise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast.     Belgium\'s GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.     While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming its borrowing requirement, \"it will probably be insufficient to check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,\" the OECD said.     In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5 pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming less competitive and imports rising. \"Employment is forecast to decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the private sector and budgetary cuts,\" the report said.     Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987 and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining domestic gas prices.     Luxembourg\'s economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in wages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year. \n',gnp
'Kuwait\'s oil-reliant and debt-ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists say.     Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.     Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.     This was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.     Factors depressing economic activity include the 6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait\'s doorstep, which threatens the emirate\'s vital oil export lifeline through the Gulf and has sapped business confidence.     But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced.     The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.     The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending, thus generating an informal credit system.     Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies.     There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs) in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under.     The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not.     Banks\' shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil.     Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.     Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.     But strategic diversification into downstream operations in Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.     Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average 2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as crude.     Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady.     External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit Gulf.     Kuwait\'s petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.     But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these reserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit for the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.     In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary, revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct, doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.     This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some shortfall.     Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next.     \"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer is important.\"     Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy.     He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.  \n',gnp
'Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax reform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.     \"Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,\" Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.     Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he forecast in the February budget.     And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32 billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.     Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated revenues.     But finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system.     The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1 billion dlrs in 1991.     Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an actual 3.1 pct.     Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around the current four pct level over the next two years.  \n',gnp
'The West German government\'s independent council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said.     A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two pct was achievable.     It added the council believed \"an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for.\"     Ost\'s statement said experts believed further pressure on West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase.     The government regularly uses the term \"changed external economic factors\" when referring to the fall of the dollar, which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but could still fall below the 1986 level.     Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.     The stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the West German government ahead of next week\'s seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.     West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.     The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.     The experts\' prediction for economic growth this year of between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.     Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987 predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct, compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.  \n',gnp
'Figures for first quarter 1987 West German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal Statistics Office said.     The official said there had been a delay in gathering information for the data, which are expected to show that the West German economy contracted in the period.     A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.     \"There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical matter,\" he added.     The West German government is expected to come under pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.     However, government officials have ruled out any further tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.     Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the widest measure of a country\'s economic activity, fell in real terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.      The government has confirmed that growth was negative in the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to be about two pct.     Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank\'s reluctance to cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate, at three pct, is just above historical lows.     West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad, is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over two years.     The government has pointed out that depressed exports are the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will compensate for this setback.     It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.  \n',gnp
'The global economy is expected to weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook, economic analysts said.     For finance ministers and central bankers attending this week\'s semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern.     The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.     In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.     For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product, another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year.     The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt.     IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.     Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.     Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations\'  economies poses fundamental worries.     Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange, including the key one of exports.     The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion, has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only 2.3 pct, according to the IMF.     For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success.     The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade deficit.     Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much slower than expected.     The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect.\"     The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion.\"^M \n',gnp
'France\'s growth rate is expected to strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly higher than in the first half of this year.     The OECD said France\'s economic situation has deteriorated somewhat during the early months of 1987.      Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.     The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.     The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct for the whole year, sharply up from last year\'s 2.2 pct.  \n',gnp
'Malaysia\'s recovery from the worst recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988 after seven years of austerity, economists said.     \"Our country is walking on one leg now,\" said Ismail Salleh, an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International Studies. \"It has to depend on public sector investment for faster growth if the private sector is not moving.\"     Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.     The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply. Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.     The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.     Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.     Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.     One businessman said too many politicians give the impression that Malaysia was unstable.     \"If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential to recover strongly is great,\" a banker said.     Malaysia\'s 1987 current account is expected to be in the black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit surplus compared with last year\'s 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.     The government has said its fiscal policies will balance the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.     The government will also repay some of its external debt, which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.     Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential goods are unlikely to change.     Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to compete for investors with neighbouring states.  \n',gnp
'The five leading West German economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.     The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen predicted in the institutes\' joint spring report that gross national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast three pct 1987 growth in October last year.     Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin and Munich\'s Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.     The joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the DIW and Ifo were \"markedly less favourable\" than those of the other three.     The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year. \"In the second half of 1987 there will, however, only be a weak upward movement,\" they said.     The two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year.     The other three institutes, however, wrote: \"The decline in demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.\"     They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans. But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off. \"It can be presumed that the braking actions (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.\"     They added: \"The domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable.\"     These three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring.     However, this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar.     Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in 1987, \"there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year.\" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.     The three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986, while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.     They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in 1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.     All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23 mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about 200,000.     These three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures. The construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980 but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.     The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector, while \"the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline.\"     The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to 2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.     They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58 billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around 100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.     The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.  \n',gnp
'The five leading West German economic research institutes, which have revised down their forecasts for 1987 growth, do not predict a recession in West Germany, their spokesman, Hans-Juergen Schmahl said.     The institutes were divided in their spring report on forecasts for 1987, with three predicting two pct growth and two seeing only one pct expansion. Growth was 2.4 pct in 1986.     Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said, \"None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the beginning of a recession.\" He added, however, that exports remained the weak point of the economy .     Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect further encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets.     Arthur Krumper of Munich\'s Ifo institute, which with the DIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of the economy, said, \"The braking effects (on the economy) produced by external factors will remain considerable for most of the year.\"  \n',gnp
'Italy\'s economic outlook for 1987 and 1988 is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly lower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade deficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last year Italy ranked as one of the OECD\'s fastest growing economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.     The OECD said Italy\'s GDP may grow by three pct in 1987, but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.     The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report said.     This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.     Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in Italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.  \n',gnp
'Italy\'s Gross Domestic Product, calculated at 1980 prices, rose 2.4 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, compared with the same period in 1985, National Statistics Institute ISTAT said.     ISTAT said in a statement that GDP growth in fourth quarter 1986 was zero compared with the preceding quarter. Italy\'s budget ministry said last month that 1986 GDP rose 2.7 pct in real terms from 1985.     Imports in the fourth quarter totalled 26,361 billion lire, down 1.4 pct from the 1985 fourth quarter and down 6.6 pct from the third 1986 quarter, ISTAT said.     Istat said exports totaled 23,190 billion lire in the fourth quarter, down 4.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter and down 6.7 pct from the third quarter in 1986.     Fixed investments were 23,438 billion lire in the fourth quarter, down 0.7 pct from the preceding quarter and up 1.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter.  \n',gnp
'Prospects for world economic growth remain very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize currencies and encourage investment, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.     \"The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months, and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments imbalances are likely to persist,\" it said in one of its gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.     The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only 2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year\'s 2.5 pct growth rate.     \"We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area comfortably exceeding three pct,\" David Henderson, head of the OECD\'s economics and statistics department, said.     The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S., Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic downturn.     \"At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth remain favorable,\" it said, citing low inflation in most major countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible labor markets.     But private sector confidence had been undermined by uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that \"for confidence to be restored, it is important for governments swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.\"     This was a clear reference to last February\'s Louvre accord of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.     The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.     Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this process, though it was too early to estimate its precise impact.     He said the measures will help strengthen Japan\'s domestic demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.     The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct increase in 1986.     There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last year.     The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from price guarantees and other measures linked to production towards direct income support for farmers.  \n',gnp
'High wage settlements in Nordic countries threaten to cut exports and reduce the international competitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration in competitiveness. Sweden\'s competitive position was also seen at risk from accelerating wages.     The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as Norway, Sweden and Finland.     Overall economic growth will vary in the different countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report said.     After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark and Norway.     Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained and balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.  \n',gnp
'West German economic growth will slow to 1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic demand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its semi-annual review of the world economy.     This view is less favourable than the West German government\'s forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.     The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year, with the gross national product rising by two pct in real terms.     The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some recovery in business confidence in the near future.     But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by 2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986\'s 3.7 pct.     While noting that the government is bringing forward a five billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that \"the medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow relatively lower tax rates.\"     Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of 1986.     Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.     West Germany\'s current account surplus, the target of considerable criticism by the Reagan administration, is expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from 35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in 1988.  \n',gnp
'The United States should take urgent action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on growth of the defense budget, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy, said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit \"could seriously affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere.\"     It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987, running until September 30 this year, would substantially overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act\'s target of 144 billion dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.     \"The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190 billion dollars,\" it said.     While this would be 30 billion lower than last year\'s deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.     The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to 2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.     In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.     Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.     \"Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors behind the avoidance of recession,\" the report said.     The current account balance of payments deficit is expected to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.     In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year, unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct this year.     Canada\'s current account deficit is projected to shrink to around four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about that level in 1988.  \n',gnp
'Pakistan says its economy has continued its recent outstanding performance during the financial year 1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments, investments and energy were causing concern.     GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980 and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according to a government economic survey.      The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum and there was an impressive performance in a five point government program for rural uplift, education and poverty alleviation, said the survey.     Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.     The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.     Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from 2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.     More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in home remittances, he said.     The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to 2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of the boost in exports.     He said national investment continued to be small because of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the present growth rate and to finance the country\'s seventh five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.  \n',gnp
'Portugal\'s economy, which has been enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade, may now be strong enough to shrug off the country\'s latest government crisis, analysts said.     But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva\'s government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.     Cavaco Silva\'s minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.     The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office.     In 1986, Portugal\'s economy grew four pct, its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.     Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken.     \"The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation,\" said Fritz Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.     \"The market doesn\'t see this as a real crisis yet,\" economist Jorge Braga de Macedo tolds.     Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress.     The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution.     Portugal\'s developing stock markets, however, remain buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.     Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell, predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year.     But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development.     Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month, can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament.     Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution. \"There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections,\" Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said.     He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year.     The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority.     A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.     Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms.     The left-wingers said Portugal\'s positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD policies.  \n',gnp
'South Africa recorded annualised real growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this year and the economy should achieve the government\'s target of three pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.     The South African central bank said in its quarterly bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the nation\'s gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement in the rand\'s exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.     It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the third and fourth quarters of last year.     It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement reached with international creditors in March as evidence of improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.     The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa\'s short term foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.     South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of 7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus of 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninth consecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985.  \n',gnp
'South Korea\'s gross national product (GNP) will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise further as long as the current account surplus continues to widen, Deputy Prime Minister Chun In-Yong told reporters.     Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said his GNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will remain stable.     The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct.     GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and 1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures.     GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.     In the first four months of this year, the current account swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period.     \"What the Minister said does not imply any major economic policy change,\" a Ministry spokesman tolds. \"But he tried to urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic (future) ... A high won era.\"     South Korean manufacturers, who have insisted the won should not rise more than seven pct this year, have said they plan to ask the government to slow down its appreciation against the dollar.     The Bank of Korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05 against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986.     The won strengthened by 6.60 won to the dollar in three days earlier this month while an International Monetary Fund team held talks here to discuss revaluation.  \n',gnp
'Strong growth in domestic demand was a key feature of the economies of southern European countries in 1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal\'s total domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption.     Turkey\'s economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year.     In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment, had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong.     The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European Community and declining competitiveness.     In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather.  \n',gnp
'The economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.     Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.     \"These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?\" said Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.     The Commerce Department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.     Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending rose a weak 0.1 per cent.     \"Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing -- are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, \" Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics, tolds.     Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages.     To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise, returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption, he says.     \"I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,\" Gramley said.     Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia.     Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, \"The pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy\" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be accommodative.     Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession.     Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an inventory overhang still exists.     He says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.     \"They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a recession,\" Mauro said.     In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve.     \"Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable,\" he said.     But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation.     Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.     The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.     \"The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle, it continues to persist,\" he said, adding he would like the Fed to tighten credit.     A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says a prominent international banker.     Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National Press Club that the dollar\'s downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the United States is the world\'s largest debtor nation.     The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever. \"It is very difficult to be optimistic,\" Gut said.  \n',gnp
'The five leading West German economic research institutes said the government should do more to stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of tax cuts planned for 1990.     In their joint spring report the institutes were divided about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national product grew 2.4 pct last year.     But the report said all the institutes believed that \"more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created.\"     The institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. \"From this point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be brought forward.\"     The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.     However, the institutes criticised the government, not only for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of its financing had been left open.     The government has not specified how the remaining 19 billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for, though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.     The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government.     They also said the government should reduce tax preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value-added tax.     The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.     They referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this as an increase in subsidies.     The institutes said total subsidies, including tax preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it should be possible \"despite ... Major political difficulties\" to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.     The institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.     The report also noted that the government was progressing only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim for more competition, it said.  \n',gnp
