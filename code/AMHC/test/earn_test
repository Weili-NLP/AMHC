'AB Astra ASTS.ST said it was proposing a two-for-one share split and the issue in June of a new series of foreign-targeted shares with lower voting rights as part of a strategy to internationalise the company.     The deal, which requires Swedish government approval, will raise the percentage of foreign voting rights allowed in the medical group to 22.5 pct from 20 pct, Astra said.

'Dutch insurer AEGON NV AEGN.AS reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits for 1987.     Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.     Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly due to its life insurance business.     Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and higher personal risks.     Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.     In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change in accounting for U.S. Annuities.     AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal investment influences that it should be accounted differently from the more traditional insurances.     This change in accounting practice and another change to account for profits made on fixed interest investments, resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln guilders.     AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The Hague.     In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.     Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these costs and made only a small contribution to the group\'s profits.     AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill for Monumental Corp.     AEGON\'s net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December 1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.   \n',earn

Official sources said the bank, France\'s sixth largest in terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,  planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.     Previously one of France\'s biggest private banks, it was nationalised by the Socialists in 1982.     The sources said it was too early to give details of the planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a likely date for the flotation launch.     So far 30 pct of the group\'s capital, currently at 10.33 mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to ten shareholders before the flotation.     The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday. \"The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,\" CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre tolds.

'Citibank A/S CCI.N, the Norwegian subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.     Citibank\'s Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad tolds, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic slump in Norway following last year\'s plunge in oil prices.     Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in Norway since 1985.     Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway\'s second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would make profit this year.     Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.

'Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration.     Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.     Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe\'s leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986, said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.     The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S., Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe, where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.     Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.     Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery El Aguila S.A. to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.     Heineken\'s Spanish activities should start yielding profit next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.     Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed West German market -- Europe\'s biggest beer market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important point,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.     \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German market, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very regionalized.      Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term.      He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.     Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total 1986 sales.     On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities.     To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which had sold successfully, Coebergh said.     Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.     Chairman Heineken said the company\'s seven year efforts to penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.     But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken\'s market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western money.  \n',earn

Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.

'National Westminster Bank USA said higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported a year earlier.     The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.     Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with 91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.     Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0 mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.     Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.     The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced by about 4.9 mln dlrs.

'Texaco Inc TX said its decision to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code will not affect the majority of its businesses.     It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its 32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property, plant and equipment, were free of the action.     Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are affected, it said.     But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.     Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL.     Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985 judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil\'s 1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp GTY. The bond almost matches the damages awarded against Texaco.     Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin to attach its assets to secure the judgment.     Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut Texaco\'s bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to the Texas courts.     Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all Texaco\'s obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of the Pennzoil lawsuit.     \"Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond issue and the larger dispute failed,\" James Kinnear, Texaco\'s president and chief executive officer, told reporters.     Kinnear said Pennzoil\'s disclosure in court papers on Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.     Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not sell any assets, Kinnear said.     Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under 11.1 billion dlrs, he added.     Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for bankruptcy.     He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a confidentiality agreement between the two companies. \"Texaco told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go to bankruptcy court,\" Jamail said.     Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco\'s assets were ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.  \n',earn

'Losses for Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW spokesman said.     The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on 1986 business, despite the provision.     One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an \"upper limit.\"     VW said in a statement following today\'s supervisory board meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing company.     VW has said computer programs were erased and documents were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign currency losses were not completed.     VW\'s former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having evaded justice.     Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985 profits. VW\'s group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares, which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.     VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5 billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985, since the new capital was in preference shares.     The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly less than three billion marks.  \n',earn
