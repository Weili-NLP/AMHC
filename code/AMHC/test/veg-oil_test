'Developing countries said the European Community (EC) would breach two international agreements if it went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.     Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the exports of 26 ACP countries.     They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect trade between the two sides.     They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.     The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could raise up to two billion Ecus a year.     EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax, are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on June 15.     Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its member country exports.     \"We can\'t believe the EC would willingly take measures to undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these measures,\" Wilson said.     The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it is approved.     Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only \"as a very last resort,\" but added that the ACP is in touch with other countries which oppose the plan.     Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats.     Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast, Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.  \n',veg-oil
'The European Community\'s farmers\' pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax which has already been proposed by the EC Commission.     Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on Tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism for cereal substitutes.     He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the Danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair meetings of their EC colleagues.     Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help the EC\'s budget problems and would provide some price stability for producers.     This would in turn help the market position for certain crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe output restrictions.     A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats succeeded in blocking the idea during this year\'s annual EC price fixing.     However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its proposals for a tax.     Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of bridging the gap between EC and world prices.  \n',veg-oil
'Dutch parliamentary parties have re-affirmed their support for the government\'s opposition to the proposed European Community tax on oils and fats, parliamentarians said.     A broad cross-section of members of parliament voiced their opposition to the tax during a debate in the lower house yesterday on the basis of possible retaliation from the U.S. And on the potentially damaging effect on Third World countries.     State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Rene Van Der Linden said the government was against the tax although it noted deepening EC financial difficulties.     \"It is difficult to be against the tax and against extra finance. The EC members have to make a choice,\" Van Der Linden said.     However, he denied the government had dropped its opposition to the proposed tax or altered its position.  \n',veg-oil
'A spokesman for the European Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.     Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission\'s Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days \"the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy.\"     The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.     Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0 billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community\'s \"standstill\" agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement.     The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system, he added.     Under the Commission\'s system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe said.     Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level.     He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy\'s oils and fats regime.     \"The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,\" he said.     Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.     It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.     EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements, he said.     The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax, Tanghe said.     The proposed system would not alter the EC nations\' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand, he said.     It is one of the proposal\'s objectives to maintain current import levels, he said.     Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the EC\'s cakes and meals requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system. Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.  \n',veg-oil
'European Community agriculture ministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of a two-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attempt to agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an EC Commission spokesman said.     He added that tomorrow\'s EC Official Journal will contain notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical nature which will come into effect on July 1 unless the ministers reach an accord.     The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but said they would not be the sort of \"dynamic\" moves which EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in the case of complete deadlock among farm ministers.     These moves would be taken only if tomorrow\'s meeting of ministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord, EC sources said.     Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices by seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sources said.     EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 still split over the Commission\'s proposal for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats.     In addition, West Germany said it would veto plans for cereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency system.     Earlier today, diplomats said Belgium, the current holder of the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop the plans for the controversial oils and fats tax.  \n',veg-oil
'Belgium, current holder of the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop a controversial oils and fats tax from this year\'s hotly-contested farm price package, diplomats said.     In a discussion document prepared for today\'s summit meeting of EC leaders, Belgium proposed the so-called \"stabilising mechanism\" be the subject of \"further study and consultation with the Community\'s main trading partners.\"     The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne on both imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marine oils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism.     The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row at the summit and breaking the deadlock at this year\'s farm price talks, contained the first formal reference to dropping the measure.     Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency on June 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They are supported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Spain.     Although the paper was not universally welcomed, diplomats said, the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for a further six months was certain to survive any redrafting.  \n',veg-oil
'A specially convened Franco-German meeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed to make any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that has deeply split the two former EC allies, diplomats said     The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign ministers from both countries and by French President Francois Mitterand, his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, and by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany.     The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the Community\'s worst-ever budget crisis.     \"The Germans clearly do not want to budge,\" an aide to Chirac told reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visibly angered as he the hour-long meeting.     Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the EC\'s complex \"green\" currrency system, designed to translate common EC farm prices into national currencies.     Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which West Germany is against, along with Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands.     EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the package, which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline tomorrow.     Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have injected fresh impetus into those talks.     The Commission proposed its package to save one billion dollars on the EC\'s ever-rising farm budget.     The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group, and plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987.  \n',veg-oil
'The rate of increase in world palm oil use is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000 tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke, editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.     He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that in the next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to 8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year average increase of 550,000 tonnes.      Opening stocks at the start of next October are expected to be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlier levels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.     The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnes above this season\'s available amount, Mielke said.     The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia will slow down from this year on, but that will be offset by area expansion in Indonesia, he said.     He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesian mature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, and at 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.     Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak, where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula, but where yields are lower, he said.      The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is also expected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean, cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and palm.     At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were unusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current season\'s prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago and with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.     Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start of next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by the end of next season.     The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last October and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 at the end of next season, Mielke said.     World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the course of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in soybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln tonnes or by one fifth.     Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S., for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln tonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks of 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this season.  \n',veg-oil

'Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO) prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree crops, told Indonesian reporters.     Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332 dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.     Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it could possibly increase its international market share.     Indonesia, the world\'s second largest producer of palm oil after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.     Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary shortage than to lose export markets.     Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500 tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank figures.  \n',veg-oil
'The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian Nainggolan said.     He tolds in a telephone interview that trading in palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.     Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil may also be introduced. But he said the question was still being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no decision on when to go ahead had been made.     The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.     \"Several factors make us move cautiously,\" Nainggolan said. \"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.\"     Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward, exchange officials said.     The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one official said a feasibility study was needed first. No decisions are likely until after Indonesia\'s elections on April 23, traders said.     Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the world\'s second largest producer of natural rubber, should expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of the exchange would help this.     Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.     He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to encourage participation.     Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start although trading in coffee has been disappointing.     Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9 mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered locally, the latest exchange report said.      Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905 tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.      Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and 44 traders.  \n',veg-oil

'The United States and India have not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the drought-stricken Asian country, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.     Lyng tolds in an interview that the two countries have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi\'s visit here this week.     \"We have been talking about the potential needs that India might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs as well as the possibilities of assistance,\" Lyng said.     \"At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. The amounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we have indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in whatever way they deem most valuable,\" he said.     There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419 of an amended 1949 law.     Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree on the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and that Washington would prefer the package include something other than donated food.     \"The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking care of themselves. India is a country that has come a long way in its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in that,\" Lyng said.     \"We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses we still have of many commodities..., would like to share in the import business the Indians do, and then we have some, as we always do, compassion for the people of India and would like to cooperate with them,\" he said.

'Malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987, oil palm growers tolds.     Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes, unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms, they said.     The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysia\'s oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year.     Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry, a leading grower tolds.     The country\'s palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes against about 800,000 last March, the growers said.     The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.     The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean, is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous 21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.     In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil output peaks.     They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow, with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years.  \n',veg-oil

'Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community (EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.     \"I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the Philippines,\" Romero said in an interview.     He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position.     Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.     Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.     He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.     Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground.     Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally, but this was likely to take several years of research.     Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.     Romero said he would also visit Oxford University\'s department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether.     \"There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra,\" Romero said. \"We can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to the chemical root.\"     He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop.     \"In the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production, and I\'m not comfortable with that,\" he said.     With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.     \"To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,\" he said.     Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents, and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.     Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests.     He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to add to the production fall, drought had affected output.     \"Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing, adding more value,\" he said.     Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.     \"A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on 10,000 square metres of land. That\'s a lot of space,\" Romero said. He said the government\'s proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.     \"If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels, production and employment then it won\'t happen,\" he said.     PCA figures show about one-third of the country\'s population is dependent on the coconut industry.     Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or one-fourth of total agricultural land.  \n',veg-oil

'A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for soybeans should help boost 1987 U.S. Soybean exports to Taiwan, a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers tolds.     He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by the cabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.     The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987 soybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, he said. The previous target for 1987 was 1.81 tonnes.     Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from the U.S. And the rest from South America.
