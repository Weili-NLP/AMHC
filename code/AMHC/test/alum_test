'Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it has cut the expected cost of its planned Laterriere, Quebec, smelter by using enhanced Grande Baie reduction technology.     The company said the decision to use prebaked anode technolgy used at its Grande Baie, Quebec, and Sebree, Ky., smelters was taken primarily for cost reasons.     As a result, it said, the estimated total cost of the planned smelter will be held to 450 mln U.S. dlrs, the low end of the range estimated in mid-May, while the cost of the first phase was cut to 150 mln dlrs from the projected 175-225 mln dlrs.  \n',alum

'China and Australia\'s Victoria state signed a joint venture contract for a 290 mln dlr aluminium processing plant in China that will export to South Korea, Australian officials told journalists.     China has no official direct trade or government ties with Seoul, while it maintains close links with North Korea.     China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) would have 75 pct of the equity in Bohai Aluminium Industries Ltd, the company to build the rolling mill and extrusion plant on the northeast China coast, they said.     It was China\'s largest joint venture so far, they said.     \"A joint venture opens up the potential for penetrating markets that would not otherwise be possible (for China),\" Victoria state treasurer Rob Jolly said.     An Australian diplomat said CITIC was eager to pursue South Korean markets. Indirect trade between China and Seoul is growing but is not officially publicised.     Victoria\'s Aluvic Ltd, on behalf of the state government, will hold a 25 pct equity stake in the project, which is intended as a sister plant to Victoria\'s Portland aluminium smelter. CITIC in May agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs in Portland.     The China-based joint venture would process Portland aluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domestic Chinese market as well as for export, Jolly said.     The Australian side\'s investment was limited to about 22 mln dlrs, but Aluvic would have the right to appoint key managers, he said.     Australian officials said they hoped the goodwill generated by their participation would lead to further CITIC investment in Victoria. The Chinese group enjoys a high level of independence from Peking\'s central government and has extensive overseas investments.  \n',alum
'China, a major aluminium importer, will open the first phase of its biggest aluminium plant on October 1, the China Daily said.     The first phase of the plant, located in Qinghai province, will have an annual capacity of 100,000 tonnes of ingots, half the capacity of the finished plant. It will turn out 4,000 tonnes in 1987, the paper said, but gave no more details.     Construction of the 510 mln yuan plant began in April 1984.     Customs figures show China imported 266,241 tonnes of aluminium and alloy in 1986, down from 487,862 in 1985.  \n',alum

'Indonesia has increased its share in a 434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with Japan from 25 to 37 pct, Asahan Project Authority director A.R. Suhud said.     The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised its share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company, capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen in government loans to the company for an equity stake.     The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24 billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.     Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between 1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company\'s 320 billion yen debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold in dollars.     Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to about 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.     Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a year, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant, situated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan.  \n',alum
'Japan\'s cabinet approved a plan to help financially-troubled aluminium ventures in Indonesia and Brazil, an official at the Ministry of International and Trade Industry (MITI) said.     Japan will invest 24 billion yen in PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium in addition to the 68.3 billion yen already invested in the company. The government and private interests will equally share the additional investment, he said.     They will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen in new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in Brazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested.     The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct, the official said.     Interest rates on loans by Japan\'s private banks to the two projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the current seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to be reached, industry sources said.     Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billion yen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32 billion yen to the company.  This will raise Indonesia\'s investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct.     The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an additional 6.5 billion yen in Albras, in which investment now totals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51 pct, the official said.     The sources said the rescue programs for the two projects were larger than earlier expected, reflecting Japan\'s desire to help develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and to stabilise sources of aluminium.     Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its aluminium demand, which totals some 1.8 mln tonnes a year, they said.  \n',alum
'The London Metal Exchange (LME) has issued a note clarifying details on its new high grade aluminium contract, in response to questions from members following the announcement of the contract, due to start June 1.  All deliverable shapes of aluminium under the high grade primary aluminium contract (minimum 99.7 pct purity) will also be deliverable against the standard primary aluminium contract (min 99.5 pct), the LME said.     Sows will not constitute good delivery against the standard contract until September 1, and 99.5 pct purity sows are not good delivery and cannot be placed on LME warrant.     The dollar quotation for the high grade contract will be in multiples of one U.S. Dollar but carries may be made at 50 cents for even tonnages only.     Singapore, which is the first port warehouse outside Europe to be used as an LME delivery point, will be used for high grade metal only and the rent imposed by owners Steinweg will be 1.05 U.S. Dlr a tonne per week, the LME said.     The LME Board, in response to representation from the trade, agreed to annul from LME contracts the minimum weight requirements of 450 kilos for T-bars and 250 kilos for sows, effective for high grade on June 1 and for standard on July 24.  \n',alum
'Reynolds Metals Co said it plans to restart the last idle potline at its Troutdale, Ore., primary aluminum plant.     With the restart of this 22,700 tonne a year production line, Reynolds said it will be operating at 100 pct of its consolidated primary aluminum capacity of 695,000 tonnes per year.     Reynolds said work on the restart will begin in the near future and it is expected that actual metal production will begin September 1.     The company said the start-up was necessitated by continuing strong demand for aluminum and dwindling worldwide inventories, and that the metal is needed to supply Reynolds\' various fabricating businesses.  \n',alum
