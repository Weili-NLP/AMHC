'The government must announce harsh cuts in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give an adequate response to Australia\'s economic problems, the ANZ Banking Group Ltd ANZA.S said.     Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14 billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthly Business Indicators publication.     \"For the past two years, the government has struggled with an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it sees as politically practicable,\" it said.     The political climate meant there would be a continued over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and maintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.     \"The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival of business investment will be further postponed,\" it said.     The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by export and import-replacement industries which had created a false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of payments crisis were past. \"Unfortunately, successful adjustment to Australia\'s deep-seated economic problems remains a long-term process,\" it said.     In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderate overall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP) rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.     The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP this year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion at end-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.     Inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988 from 8.9 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were expected, ANZ said.  \n',bop

'Belgium\'s current account surplus, measured on a cash basis, widened sharply to 134.9 billion francs last year from 17.5 billion in 1985, the Finance Ministry said.

The services trade surpluses increased to 52.4 billion francs from 38.9 billion while the deficit on transfers rose slightly to 43.6 billion from 41.8 billion.

Dlrs in April from a revised 89 mln dlrs in March, and 224 mln dlrs in April 1986, in a smoothed seasonally-adjusted measurement, the Statistics Department said.     The March figure was revised from 69 mln dlrs.

'The Washington Post said the U.S. Commerce Department yesterday issued a new report showing that the U.S. Merchandise trade deficit was 13.65 billion dollars in February, a reduction of 1.4 billion dlrs from the 15.06 billion figure the department reported only two days earlier.     The newspaper said: \"News of the unexpectedly large 15 billion deficit helped batter the dollar\'s value on foreign exchange markets and boosted U.S. Interest rates.     \"However, the new report went largely unnoticed by financial markets since such a downward revision in the deficit is a monthly occurrence.\"     The Washington Post said: \"By law, the department must first publish what a top commerce official agreed are misleading trade figures and then wait 48 hours before putting out the more accurate ones.\"     No one was immediately available at the Commerce Department for comment on the Washington Post report.  \n',bop
'South Korea has decided on major changes in its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducing the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a trade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.     Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports could make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase &#127;nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which means abandoning Seoul\'s goal of rapidly reducing its foreign debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.     Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation and rationalising exports.     He said Seoul would try to limit its current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few years, although trade volume would continue to grow.     \"This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP (gross national product) from the current five pct level to three pct by 1991,\" he added.     Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea\'s foreign debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5 billion dlrs at end-1986.     \"But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,\" he said.     The policy change was announced two days before the scheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.     South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.     Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing in South Korea\'s current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose 36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.     The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5 billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw materials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.     \"The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at 1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are considerable incentives given to increase imports,\" Koo said.     Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency. \"It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean currency continues to rise in value,\" he said.     He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the dollar gradually, but added \"We do not believe in rapid one-shot changes in the value of the won.\"     The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen six pct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986.  \n',bop
'Spain had a 35 mln dlr current account surplus in February compared with a 68 mln dlr surplus in January and a 355 mln dlr surplus in February last year, Bank of Spain figures show.     Spain\'s trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159 mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986.     Exports at 2.58 billion dlrs were up 19 pct compared with February last year, but imports were 46 pct higher than last February, totalling 3.16 billion dlrs.     Non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with 1.91 billion in February last year, reflecting the large ammount of investment goods entering the country with the recovery of the Spanish economy, the Bank of Spain said.     Spain\'s tourism earnings continued to grow and totalled 655 mln dlrs in February, compared with 103 mln dlrs in January and 502 mln dlrs in February last year.  \n',bop
'Turkey\'s current account deficit widened in July to 674 mln dlrs from 454 mln in June but fell from 1.22 billion in July last year, the State Statistics Institute said.     The cumulative trade position in July showed a 1.85 billion dlr deficit after 1.33 billion in June and 1.89 billion a year earlier, with exports at 4.91 billion and imports, both FOB, at 6.76 billion.     The government aims to narrow the current account deficit for the whole of 1987 to 975 mln dlrs, compared with 1.52 billion last year, up from 1.01 billion in 1985.     Bankers forecast the 1987 deficit will exceed one billion dlrs,  because a spurt in exports is expected to slow considerably in the last five months following a massive drawdown of inventories.  \n',bop

'The World Bank will support Sri Lanka\'s development program provided the country reduces its budget and current account deficits, the Ministry of Finance said.
