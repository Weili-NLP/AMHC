Total net reserves, including reserves held by commercial and major savings banks and corrected for exchange rate adjustments, rose to 58.373 billion crowns in May from 47.835 billion in April, against 32.443 billion in May 1986.     The Bank said in a statement that public loan transactions accounted for net capital import of 0.1 billion crowns in May, with net registered private capital imports of 9.1 billion.     \"Of this, the net sale of Danish crown bonds to other countries totalled about 2.5 billion crowns. There was balance between the purchase and sale of foreign securities,\" the statement added.     The Central Bank said that figures for private bank reserves and registered capital movements were provisional and there was no estimate yet of unregistered movements.     \"It is therefore not possible on this basis to draw conclusions about the developments of the external current account,\" the statement added.  \n',reserves
'French official reserves rose 258 mln francs in May to 420.50 billion francs from 420.24 billion at the end of April, the Finance Ministry said.     The slight rise partly reflected the repayment last month of France\'s outstanding 11.95 billion francs of debt owed to the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).     It also reflected a negative 314 mln franc position with France\'s Exchange Stabilisation Fund after intervention purchases of 10.6 billion francs during May.     Foreign currency holdings fell 7.28 billion francs to 124.58 billion while ECU holdings fell by 5.55 billion francs to 58.52 billion due to the repayment of part of France\'s debt owed to the FECOM and Stabilisation Fund operations, the ministry said.     Claims on the IMF rose 1.14 billion francs to 18.97 billion, including a 385 mln franc increase in France\'s reserve position with the IMF and a 751 mln franc rise in holdings of Special Drawing Rights.     Gold holdings were unchanged at 218.46 billion francs.  \n',reserves

'Spain\'s foreign reserves rose by 905 mln dlrs in February to total 17.05 billion dlrs, compared with 14.11 billion dlrs in February 1986, Bank of Spain figures show.     Under a new accounting system introduced this month, Spain\'s foreign reserves now exclude foreign currency held by financial institutions.     Under the previous system, Spain\'s foreign reserves would have risen by 391 mln dlrs in February, taking into account a fall of 514 mln dlrs in financial institutions\' foreign currency position.     In January this year, the Central Bank\'s foreign reserves rose by 143 mln dlrs, while financial institutions\' foreign currency position fell by 118 mln dlrs.  \n',reserves
'Sight deposits of commercial banks at the Swiss National Bank fell 4.64 billion Swiss francs to 7.88 billion in the first 10 days of April, the National Bank said.     Foreign exchange reserves rose by 9.4 mln francs to 33.12 billion.     Sight deposits are an important measure of money market liquidity in Switzerland.     The National Bank said banks repaid around 5.8 billion francs of traditional central bank credit taken out to meet their end-of-quarter liquidity requirements. This was partially offset by new swap arrangements.     Bank notes in circulation fell 440.2 mln francs to 24.48 billion while other deposits on call at the National Bank -- mainly government funds -- fell 840.5 mln francs to 941.5 mln.  \n',reserves
'Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves, bouyed by rising exports, have hit a record high and are likely to soar to 72 billion U.S. Dlrs by the year end, central bank officials said Tuesday.     Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the reserves totalled about 69 billion U.S. Dlrs, compared with about 42 billion at the same time last year and 68 billion on October 5. He declined to elaborate.     A senior bank official, who declined to be named, tolds the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs at the end of the year.     \"The surge in reserves is the result of our trade surplus and recent purchases of U.S. Dollars on the local interbank market,\" Chang said.     Taiwan\'s trade surplus hit a record 14.95 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first nine months of 1987 compared with 11.05 billion a year earlier, official figures show.     Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-hsien said the surplus will rise to about 20 billion dlrs by the end of the year. About 80 pct of the surplus will come from the island\'s trade with the United States.      Chien said Taiwan\'s trade will reach 80 billion U.S. Dlrs this year compared with 63.96 billion last year.     Its exports are expected to total 50 billion and imports 30 billion against exports of 39.79 billion and imports of 24.17 billion last year.  \n',reserves
'The Treasury Department said it would release data on U.S. reserve assets on a monthly basis from now on instead of quarterly.

Assets totaled 46.59 billion dlrs at the end of April, compared with 48.82 billion dlrs at the end of March, the Treasury said.  \n',reserves
'The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K. Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11 general election, market analysts said.     Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.     But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now available to the authorities to support the pound should curb any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the ruling Conservative Party\'s lead slipping, they added.     \"We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we have done hitherto,\" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the record reserves rise.     He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign exchanges. \"We have been playing a very full part ourselves,\" he said.     But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down its rise, more in the light of local factors.     Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities, said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.     U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.     Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.     Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0 pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.     \"The market doesn\'t want to do anything because of the election,\" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.     Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the forward market.     The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth the pound\'s sudden downturn, while some of the intervention reported in May probably occurred in April, they said.     The key three months interbank money market rates eased about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves news, analysts said.     Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was muted as traders worried about the funding implications of another huge rise in reserves, they added.     Morgan Grenfell\'s Bell forecast a half point base rate cut from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove accurate, with another half point later.     Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be possible. \"Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in future, rather than this active intervention,\" he predicted.     Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut looked likely.     A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.     \"The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And has signalled some worry about broad money (growth),\" said Robin Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.     He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the European Monetary System.     But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10 or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.  \n',reserves
'Britain\'s gold and currency reserves rose a record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in May, following April\'s 2.9 billion dlrs increase, the Treasury said.     The underlying trend indicates the level of recent Bank of England intervention on currency markets to curb sterling\'s strength. It was above market expectations which had been for a rise of between one billion and three billion dlrs.     The Treasury declined comment on the figures.     Actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in May, compared with April\'s 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68 billion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of April.     Borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 238 mln dlrs, against April\'s 66 mln. Repayments under the scheme were 85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repayments of eight mln, after three mln last month.     Repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs.     The underlying reserves increase is net of borrowings and repayments.     It was larger than the previous record 3.04 billion dlrs rise seen in October 1977. The May increase represents the seventh monthly rise, with reserves up 9.947 billion dlrs in that period, and up 9.816 billion since the start of 1987.  \n',reserves
