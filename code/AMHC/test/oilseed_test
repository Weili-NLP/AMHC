'The American Soybean Association (ASA) denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not remedy the situation.     ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored Outlook 87 conference: \"It will be filed unless the EC takes drastic and immediate steps.\"     \"These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal, since they were established after the zero soybean duty was established in 1962,\" he said.     The ASA\'s unfair trade petition against the EC would ask for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to make the regime non-discriminatory.     The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production has risen dramatically since then.     The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world market levels and is considering implementing a controversial oils and fats tax.     The subsidies \"are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,\" Adams said.     The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.     U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of EC policies, Adams added.     Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973 when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.  \n',oilseed
'Based on field travel in the Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.     The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazil\'s total soybean crop.     It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.     However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the report said.     The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems, the report said.     Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are expected to be above average, it said.     Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested.     During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the report said.     New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests.  \n',oilseed

'India\'s oilseed output is expected to rise to 12.25 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ending October, up on 11.15 mln in 1985/86 but down from 12.95 mln harvested in 1984/85, the Agriculture Ministry\'s 1986/87 report said.     But the forecast for 1986/87 is well below a target of 14.8 mln tonnes fixed for the year, it said, adding bad weather hit groundnut and other oilseed crops.     The National Oilseeds Development Program will invest 300 mln rupees in 1986/87 on supplying improved high-yielding seeds and other support services to help boost production, it added. India imports about 1.2 mln tonnes of edible oils a year.  \n',oilseed
'The Reserve Bank of India said it was tightening its credit policy for commercial banks by raising their cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct to 10 pct, effective from October 24.     The move, announced last weekend, is part of the bank\'s policy for the second half of fiscal 1987/88 ending March and is aimed at curbing excess bank liquidity.     The central bank also put selective controls on bank advances to the oilseeds, vegetable oils and foodgrains trades.     \"The policy\'s main objective is to fully meet the credit requirements of agriculture, industry and exports, while preventing excessive monetary expansion,\" bank Governor R.N. Malhotra told an earlier meeting of chief executives of banks.     Malhotra said the rate of monetary expansion must be kept under control in the second half of the current financial year.     Bank deposits rose 75.40 billion rupees in the first six months of fiscal 1987/88 against 66.92 billion in the same period last year, according to the bank.     Bankers said the bank\'s move to raise the cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct will mean impounding about five billion rupees from the banking system. Banks\' total deposits are estimated at around 1,000 billion rupees.     They said banks are under pressure because of low returns on commercial lending and investments in government securities.     \"Already many banks are finding it difficult to maintain their statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios and are resorting to heavy inter-bank borrowings,\" said one banker.  \n',oilseed

'Nearby months in soybean and soymeal futures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply of livestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep the new crop outlook bearish, traders said.     \"A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,\" one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.     Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a Decatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid another two cents today to 10 over July futures.     Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light, with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing to sell, dealers said.     Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief that even if futures rally back to last month\'s highs, country movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half of the Midwest.     Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the spot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.     Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal has already moved to a premium over the August through October months and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may also move to a July premium later this month, they added.  \n',oilseed

'The U.S. is drafting options including possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over the differential between soybean and product  taxes which Buenos Aires levies on exports.     The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S. officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina\'s differential export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in competition with the U.S.     \"Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict (Argentine) access to our market,\" said one U.S. source.         The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to end the differential.     But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88 year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.     Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not narrow the differential further for 1987/88.     As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.     A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan administration soon, they said.  \n',oilseed
'Reporting members of the National Soybean Processors Association (NSPA) crushed 19,416,000 bushels of soybeans in the week ended April 8 compared with 20,115,000 bushels in the previous week and 17,160,000 in the year-ago week, the association said.     It said total crushing capacity for members was 25,873,904 bushels vs 25,873,904 last week and 25,459,238 bushels last year.     NSPA also said U.S. soybean meal exports in the week were 70,351 tonnes vs 135,452 tonnes a week ago and compared with 76,065 tonnes in the year-ago week.

'A proposal to require imported tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.     The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a 10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers\' hopes the plan would be adopted this year.     A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.     Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an amendment to a farm spending reduction package.     \"I don\'t see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving American consumers the information they need,\" he said.     Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.     The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.     But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal \"blatantly discriminates\" against imports, would be impossible to defend under international trade law and would harm relations with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.     Yeutter\'s letter also said Americans derive most of their saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively little from tropical oils.     The committee voted largely along party lines, with three Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.  \n',oilseed
