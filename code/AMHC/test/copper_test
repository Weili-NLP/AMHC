'China\'s state-owned Beijing Non-Ferrous Metals Industrial Corp and Wrought Copper Ltd of Chile signed a contract to jointly build a copper tube plant on the outskirts of Peking, the China Daily said.     The Beijing-Santiago Copper Tube Co involves an investment of 9.93 mln dlrs and will, on completion, have a production capacity of 5,000 tonnes of copper tubes a year, it said.     It said Chile will supply copper at preferential rates to the venture, whose equipment comes from Wednesbury Tube Co of U.K.     The agreement calls for joint Sino-Chilean management of the venture for 15 years, the paper said.     It said the venture is the first economic cooperation project between China and Chile, but gave no more details.     China is a major copper importer. Customs figures show it imported 171,118 tonnes of copper and alloy in calendar 1986, down from 355,652 tonnes in 1985.  \n',copper
'The Paris-based Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries (CIPEC) is closely studying the current backwardation in world copper market prices but does not envisage taking corrective action at present, CIPEC sources here said.     The organisation\'s executive and marketing committees reviewed the current market situation during a series of meetings here late last week, but took no major decisions.     The sources noted that the backwardation - premium of nearby supply over forward delivery - dates back several weeks and is the longest on record.    \"It\'s unusual,\" one official said, but added CIPEC did not have any immediate recipe to remedy the situation.     The meetings featured a gathering of the 10 directors of CIPEC\'s regional copper development and promotion centres, which are based in Europe, Japan, India and Brazil.     Their main aim was to prepare the ground for the annual ministerial meeting of CIPEC, which is scheduled for Zaire in late September.     The last three ministerial meetings have been held in Paris to keep down costs.  \n',copper

'Noranda Inc said it began salvage operations at its Murdochville, Quebec mine where a fire last week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.      Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is still unknown but the fire destroyed 6,000 feet of conveyor belt.     The company said extreme heat from the fire caused severe rock degradation along several ramps and drifts in the mine.     Production at the mine has been suspended until investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986.      The smelter continues to operate with available concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said.  \n',copper
'Noranda Inc said it began salvage operations at its Murdochville, Quebec, mine, where a fire last week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.      Another 56 miners were trapped underground for as long as 24 hours before they were brought to safety.     Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is still unknown but said it does know that the fire destroyed 6,000 feet of conveyor belt.      Noranda said work crews have begun securing the ramp leading into the zone where the fire was located. The company said extreme heat from the fire caused severe rock degradation along several ramps and drifts in the mine.      Noranda estimated that the securing operation for the zone will not be completed before the end of April.     Noranda said the Quebec Health and Safety Commission, the Quebec Provincial Police and Noranda itself are each conducting an investigation into the fire.     Production at the mine has been suspended until the investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986 and employs 680 people.      The smelter continues to operate with available concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said.  \n',copper
'Finland\'s state-owned mining company Outokumpu Oy said in a statement it was entering Spanish markets as a shareholder in Iberica del Cobre, S.A., a manufacturer of copper products.     Outokumpu will acquire 21 pct of the shares in the Spanish company and a company will be set up as an agent for Outokumpu Spain. The deal awaits approval by the Spanish government.     Iberica del Cobre makes tubes, rods, rolled and drawn copper and alloy products and its sales of 87,000 tonnes of output in 1986 amounted to 22 billion pesetas. Outokumpu\'s turnover in 1986 was 7.58 billion markka.  \n',copper
'Phelps Dodge Corp is prepared to make another large non-copper acquisition and a deal could be struck in the near future, chairman G. Robert Durham said.     Durham tolds the company was examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any. Any acquisition must have a different economic cycle to copper, he said.     Phelps Dodge, the largest U.S. copper producer, last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals Co which makes carbon black used in rubber and tires. The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and then match earnings between copper and non-copper operations.     The company could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs to buy another non-copper firm, Durham said, citing 100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.  \n',copper
'Teck Corp said it was continuing talks about joining a joint copper venture at Highland Valley, British Columbia, held by affiliates Cominco Ltd CLT and Lornex Mining Corp, but did not know when negotiations would be completed.     Teck vice-president of administration John Guminski said in reply to a query that the talks had been \"ongoing for a long time.\" He declined to speculate on the outcome.     Cominco, 29.5 pct owned by a consortium led by Teck, is optimistic that the talks will soon be concluded, spokesman Don Townson tolds.     \"I think all partners are hopeful that the situation will be resolved,\" Cominco\'s Townson said.     \"We\'re optimistic that they will be concluded shortly,\" he added. Townson declined to specify when the talks might end.     Cominco and Teck\'s 22 pct-owned Lornex agreed in January 1986 to form the joint venture, merging their Highland Valley copper operations.     Cominco and Lornex share equally in control and management of the Highland Valley operations, while Cominco has a 55 pct share of production and Lornex receives 45 pct.     For the six months following July 1, 1986, when the venture officially started production, Highland Valley had total ore milled of 22.6 mln short tons, grading an average of 0.41 pct copper, Townson said.     Cominco\'s share of production was 43,000 short tons of copper contained in concentrate, 1,200 short tons of Molybdenum in concentrate, 340,000 ounces of silver and 800 ounces of gold, he said.     A consortium, 50 pct owned by Teck and 25 pct each by MIM (Canada) Inc and Metallgesellschaft Canada Ltd, acquired its Cominco stake last year from Canadian Pacific Ltd CP.  \n',copper
'The Zambian government today announced minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.     However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal, were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more sweeping reductions.     Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.     Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.     In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.     President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.     The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia\'s IMF austerity program.     Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile region to take action against shops that did not reduce their prices after today\'s deadline. Fifteen people were killed in the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the government tried to lift maize subsidies.  \n',copper
'Zambia\'s copper mining industry is hoping to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a year in the next few years despite low world prices, deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry officials said.     But Zambia\'s decision to abandon last May 1 a tough International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.     Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.     \"We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due to greater availability of spares and equipment,\" a ZCCM official said.     ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.     Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes higher than the previous year and the best production achieved to date.     Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper industry in Zambia, the world\'s fifth biggest producer. Mining is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the country\'s foreign exchange earnings.     Production has also been seriously affected in recent years by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of spare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.     A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984 by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African Development Bank and the World Bank.     The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.     ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as part of the plan.     More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under the five-year restructuring plan.     Company officials said although reserves were being depleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the end of the century, though at lower levels of production.     Industry sources said ZCCM\'s projected pre-tax profit for the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being levied, a net loss is likely to be registered.     ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.     Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in 1985, ZCCM\'s profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over two to the dollar.     But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund, and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic strategy based on national resources.     ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the break with the IMF will have on the industry\'s plans.     \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare under the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, tolds.     Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM\'s export profits.     \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.     High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian industry.     Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69 cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States and under 40 cents in Chile.     The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had stopped sBending copper south through South Africa.     Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while 5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira. Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and fuel.  \n',copper
