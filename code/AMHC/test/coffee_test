'Brazil\'s coffee exports could amount to 19 mln bags this year, because of the excellent crop estimate of 35.2 mln bags, an IBC spokesman said.     He said exports could surpass the average annual 18 mln bags mark, especially if the final harvest to be conducted in October and November confirms the crop at over 35 mln bags.     He said the average limit of errors for the official crop harvest could be set at five pct above or below the first estimates officially published today.     He said the IBC agreed with a request by producers for the Institute to ask the government for a monthly indexation of the guarantee minimum price.  \n',coffee

'A Colombia government trade official has urged the business community to aggressively diversify its activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.     Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become what he called \"mental hostages\" to coffee, traditionally Colombia\'s major export.     The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987 coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.  \n',coffee
'Colombia\'s coffee export registrations remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered, Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters\' association said.     \"The philosophy of the new policy is not to close registrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed,\" he tolds.     On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and May for an unlimited amount.     Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6, or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the average in recent years.     He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national coffee growers\' federation at about the same, meaning a total of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by Colombia.     \"The only change that could happen is, because of the volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations would be for June shipment, etc\" Arango said.  \n',coffee
'A U.S. government trade official responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.     Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.     \"There is one country which evidently still does not,\" Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.     Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.     He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical discussions with Colombian officials.     While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe, Cardenas left a \"positive letter,\" Rosenbaum said.     The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns with the technical details of the Colombian plan.     Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by European coffee roasters and traders.     Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.     The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas unless \"objective criteria\" which reflect recent changes in the coffee market are used to set export limits.  \n',coffee

'Consumer countries should not intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas, Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said.     \"Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of producers as has been traditional,\" Dauster, a delegate at the recent coffee symposium here, told journalists. \"When consumers want to get involved, talks are much more difficult.\"     The main consumer country the United States and main producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in February.     Dauster said Brazil\'s role when the ICO meets in London in September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the hands of producer countries.     \"We have sacrificed a great deal already,\" he said. \"this year we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we are not in a position to do favours.\"  \n',coffee
'European coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.     Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.     The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil, the world\'s biggest coffee producer, an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement, van Horick said.     If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement, van Horick said.     Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil.     Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.     \"Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal leaves it very little to object to,\" van Horick said.     \"The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality,\" he said. \"Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone.\"     Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.     Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year\'s quota.     \"If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula, \" van Horick said.     At the same time much will depend on Brazil\'s attitude.     \"Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might just get an agreement,\" van Horick added.  \n',coffee

'The Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to submit details of past export performance in order that individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.     He tolds IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.     Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be used for calculating the export performace portion.     The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers participation and use this as a basis for allocation of individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.     He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate. Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export sales declaration form.     Auctions will not start until after the opening of export registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of the week, opening registraions from Monday.     A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the CNPC\'s export marketing committee to establish a system for allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels, the spokesman added.     A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure shipments are kept in line with the country\'s ICO quota.  \n',coffee

'European coffee traders and roasters may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting here this week, traders and officials tolds.     Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the world\'s biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.     \"The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil\'s attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, \" one said.     However, the European coffee trade federation meeting, which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week, has revealed gaps in the European position on re-introducing quotas.     Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing countries.     The roasters said the positions were generally fairly close, and problems with some Government officials.     Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.     Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.     \"Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present a common European Community (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,\" one trader said.     \"We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,\" one official said.     \"We have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned,\" he added.     Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.     \"Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota re-introduction, \" he said.     \"The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors,\" one trader said.     \"However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota meeting in September,\" the official said.  \n',coffee
'A voluntary compliance system for monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and trade sources.     \"Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and  importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other,\" one analyst said.     On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.     Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification, it will still be allowed entry.     While many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls, trade sources said.     \"Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,\" a U.S. Customs spokesman said.     \"Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when its hands are tied, it doesn\'t have the authority to demand Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to destination),\" he said.     Many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system.     \"It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement,\" said one major U.S. roaster.      \"Last time we had a gentleman\'s agreement, the trade did not act as a gentleman,\" said another analyst adding, \"without the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the producers\' hands.\"     Some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market, in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount. Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely labelled.     According to customs officials, several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations, forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans.     \"If there\'s that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions,\" said Paine Webber analyst Bernie Savaiko.     Still, others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the U.S. in the near term.     \"It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee, I don\'t think that it poses that much of a threat,\" one trader said.  \n',coffee
'Uganda plans to export roasted coffee to Europe by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.     A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda\'s Ministry of Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind and pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in December and the factory should be ready by next October.     He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee Marketing Board to supply his company Unipack with 24,000 tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan from the Banque Industrielle d\'Afrique Oriental in Paris.     Uganda is the world\'s fifth largest coffee producer, and expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.     Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit Uganda\'s economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln (60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the latest International Coffee Agreement.     In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be substantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.     The U.S. Is the biggest buyer of Ugandan coffee, most of which is used to produce instant coffee.  \n',coffee
'Uganda\'s Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has stopped offering coffee on the international market because it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.     The board suspended offerings last week but because of its urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it could sustain, the sources added.     Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the Kenyan port of Mombasa.     Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by holding up remittance of Uganda\'s hard currency earnings from coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.     The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty for such delays, it added.     Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100 billion.     The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.     The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda\'s export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.     CMB officials have forecast that because the government has restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.  \n',coffee
