'At least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240 mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the past few months, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said, quoting an official in the National Food Authority (NFA).     The official, who was not named, said a large corn shortage and corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel have jeopardised the government\'s ban on corn imports, which was aimed at saving foreign currency.     The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan as saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnes against a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.     Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150 hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.     The newspaper quoted Linda Geraldez, an NFA statistician, as saying despite the drought and the shortage, the total inventory at the end of the January/June crop season is expected to be at least 201,000 tonnes.  \n',grain

'Australia could lose valuable wheat markets through lack of availability if plantings for the coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.     \"If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its valuable markets,\" he said in a statement.     Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.     However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were facing enormous financial pressures.     He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about 16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.     If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.     \"Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat understand a decrease in production due to drought but they will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to decrease production,\" Condon said.     \"If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export income earner, governments and government authorities will need to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing viability of the wheat industry,\" he added.     Australia\'s leading wheat markets include China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.  \n',grain

The government welcomed a decision by the Australian Waterside Workers\' Federation to lift its ban on shipments to Fiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-elected government was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.     The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat, fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the union decision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of rice and wheat from an Australian port, the government said.

'Storage problems with Brazil\'s record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.     Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, tolds he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year\'s estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.     He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems.     Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop.     But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation\'s capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.     The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity.     Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation\'s grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space.     In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said.     Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops.     The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.  \n',grain
'U.S. House and Senate budget negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending on agricultural programs, Congressional sources tolds.     The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4 billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.     The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.     The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior Congressional aides tolds.     Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find the budget savings.     Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.     House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.     But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget savings Glickman claims.     Another area where Glickman and other have said budget savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program, ARP, levels for wheat and corn.     However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30 pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.     Congressional sources said the only way to achieve significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as unfair to one commodity.     Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most likely to eventually look for budget savings are some tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.     Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion but not enough, they said.     Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.     This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.  \n',grain
'Current prospects for this year\'s grain crop in Bulgaria and Romania appear less favorable than in 1986, the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s officer in Belgrade said in a field report.

It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the prolonged winter temperatures this spring.     However, in general plant development was at least three weeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied greatly by regions, the report said.     Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about 65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others varied considerably, the report said.     Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and uneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in those fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.  \n',grain

For the barley, rebates of between 138 and 141.25 European currency units (Ecus) per tonne were sought, for maize they were between 129.65 and 139 Ecus, for bread-making wheat around 145 Ecus and for feed wheat around 142.45 Ecus.     Barley rebates of up to 138.50 Ecus were requested for a total of 40,000 tonnes and at 139 Ecus for 85,000 tonnes.

'The U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.     The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers\' Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or end-of-season stocks.     However, the officials said the USDA\'s figure of end 1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87\'s 2.87 mln was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.     The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.     This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around 31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.     ONIC\'s first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC official said.     Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.     He said, however, that among countries to which France could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.     The USDA\'s forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in 1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature, was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.     Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.     It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares, down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.  \n',grain
'Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.     They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.     However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.     Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.     There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.     Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean.     However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.     Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.     The season\'s sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln.     Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.     Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.     Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously.     This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes.     Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last season\'s 3.85 mln.     Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April.     The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.     The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season\'s 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop.     The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln.     The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86.     The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available.     Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.  \n',grain

'Indonesia rejected World Bank recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as the country\'s foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5 billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.     Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks distributed today as Indonesia\'s 14 foreign donor nations met at The Hague, said, \"The general argument presented by the Bank for this free trade, open economy view is weak.\"     The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural growth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.     The Bank report said Indonesia\'s rice production had peaked and the subsidies are a waste of money.     Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers, exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.     Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the government would continue to maintain production targets for \"strategic commodities\" such as rice and sugar.     The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia\'s drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country would save money by importing the commodity.     However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.     He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry develop and because of \"over-production and price intervention in the developed nations.\"  \n',grain

'Italy\'s barley crop is generally in good condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam said.     First consignments were expected to be available around mid-June.     Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia, which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop because of extreme dryness.     Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year\'s low levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.     Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national production would be around two pct higher than in the previous season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.     If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an increase of 11 pct compared to 1986.  \n',grain
'The Agriculture Ministry declined comment on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.     \"We have no idea about the report and cannot comment,\" a spokesman tolds.     Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources, said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for farm talks.     The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.     Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff Control Act.     Nihon Keizai said Japan\'s plan resulted from worries about mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is justified, it said.     The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade round last September. It will take four years to negotiate.  \n',grain

'The Soviets have not indicated an urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng tolds.     In an exclusive interview withs, Lyng said he did not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.     \"Last year it was well into the year before we offered it. There\'s been nothing that\'s taken place to indicate to me that there\'s a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a wheat subsidy).\"     When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet summit, Lyng said, \"No, I don\'t think so. I don\'t think that.\"     The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for discussion at a summit.     \"It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions about,\" Lyng said.     \"When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was not something that would be discussed with the President of the United States. He said it\'s not presidential,\" Lyng said.     Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.     The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the long-standing agreement.     \"We\'ve had three years in a row in which the Soviets have failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union, but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that. These are some of the questions we need to discuss.\"     When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from the agreement, Lyng said, \"I don\'t know. It certainly hasn\'t been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running they\'ve (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an agreement.\"  \n',grain
'Residents of central Oklahoma returned to their homes over the weekend after a week of heavy rains and severe flooding that left two dead and caused more than 20 mln dlrs in damage, officials said.     Some 900 people were evacuated from their homes during the rains and flooding last week, civil defense officials said.     Many of the shelters set up throughout the state in areas threatened by flooding, except those near the Washita and Red Rivers, closed as residents returned to their damaged homes.     Farmers who had expected a near-record wheat crop now say this year will see one of the largest losses in decades.     Gov. Henry Bellmon, who on Thursday declared a flooding emergency for central Oklahoma, was expected to ask President Reagan for federal disaster relief for the area.     In northern Texas, officials reported several tornadoes on Friday. A twister in Lubbock yesterday damaged six mobile homes and two houses. No injuries were reported.  \n',grain

'The Pakistani government allowed the private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy announced to cover the next three years.     Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn.     Cotton and rice are Pakistan\'s main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and rice along with the state corporations.     He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and to enable them to compete effectively in the world market. This would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.  \n',grain

'Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier this month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week, according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather Inc.     \"There is going to be more rain for the next two, three days,\" he said. \"We\'re in a fairly wet pattern with normal to above normal moisture this week.\"     Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.     Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.     Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.     \"Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a pretty good rain,\" Mohler said.     Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off 19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.     Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage in early July, he said.  \n',grain

'Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S. farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they approve of the proposal.     The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.     Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings examining farm programs.     Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his \"Family Farm Act.\"     -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income and reduce government spending on agriculture.     -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would increase overall revenue from exports.     This would be done by seeking agreement among major exporting countries including the European Community on market sharing at agreed high prices.     Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing that such a grain export cartel is not workable.     -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices stem more from \"gouging\" by food processing companies than from high farm product prices.     Harkin cited what he termed \"excessive\" net returns on equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J. Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct Quaker Oats.     -- Harkin said a \"legitimate\" concern about his bill would be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.     He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp. grain stocks for three years.     Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a \"predictable and stable\" grain price, he said.     -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm participation would be no more \"mandatory\" than the current farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect farm income.  \n',grain

'Recent announcements from Moscow of next year\'s grain production targets indicate that the Soviets are estimating this year\'s grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes, Agriculture Department analysts said.     USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987 grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.     Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday, putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be \"25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.\"     \"This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213 mln tonne (grain) crop,\" the analyst said.         In calculating Moscow\'s crop estimate, USDA used the 235 mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure published in a Soviet economic journal this month.     USDA\'s production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.     Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.     While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be as good or better than last year\'s 210 mln tonne harvest.

'The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last week\'s increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said.     Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died.     That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the government\'s subsidy bill.     However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF.     \"There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people,\" a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.  \n',grain
