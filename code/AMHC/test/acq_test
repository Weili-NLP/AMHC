'Borg-Warner BOR Corp, facing an unwanted offer from GAF Corp GAF, agreed to a 4.23 billion dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc.     Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the new company, AV Holdings Corp, will begin a 48.50 dlr per share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of Borg-Warner common stock.     The offer will be followed by a merger in which each remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and 54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated discount debentures.     As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said members of management do not plan to participate in the transaction, but they will retain their positions with the company.     A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner\'s shares.     GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.     Borg-Warner\'s spokeswoman said the company still plans to sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.     Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.     In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.     James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, said, \"We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its strong presence in the Chicago community.\"     Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer, which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing arrangements.     The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or 51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.     Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.     Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the financing required to complete the transaction.     The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying cash interest after five years.     The debentures will be redeemable at the company\'s option for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at 102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.     The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before maturity.     Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50 dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.     The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right, effective immediately.  \n',acq

'CSR Ltd CSRA.S intends to proceed with its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd MNRA.S despite the counter-bid from Equiticorp Tasman Ltd (ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert tolds.     ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier\'s issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative. This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR\'s proposed bid.     The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.      Herbert said Britain\'s Redland Plc RDLD.L, which holds just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and had told CSR it is not a seller.     He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.     The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.     CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.      ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond describing it as a long term investment.     ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is a leader in building materials, Herbert said.     \"We fit better with Monier,\" he said.     CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves into energy several years ago.     Asked what he thought ETL\'s bid sought to achieve, Herbert said: \"I\'m puzzled as to what Hawkins\' strategy is. One has to wonder if Monier is the main target.\"      Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.     Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.     The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.     Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.      ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the negotiations foundered on the price.     Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not think ETL\'s intervention would flush out a full Redland bid although Monier\'s ultimate fate rests in its hands.     \"Redland is still in the driving seat,\" said Tim Cohen of Ord Minnett Ltd, adding that Redland would be happier having CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.

Dairy Farm said it will finance the acquisition by placing 89 mln shares with affiliate Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd JARS.HK at 5.10 H.K. Dlrs each for a total of 454 mln dlrs.     The placement will raise Jardine Strategic\'s stake in Dairy Farm to 39.75 pct from the current 35.3 pct.     It said the Kwik Save purchase will also be financed with a loan from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp HKBH.HK. It did not give the size of the loan but it said it would raise its net bank borrowings to a maximum of 2.2 billion H.K. Dlrs.     Dairy Farm said it would reduce its bank borrowings by the proceeds from the previously announced sale of its office building in Sydney for 625 mln dlrs.     It will consider raising additional capital, most probably through a placement of convertible preference shares in the Euromarket, it added.     Company chairman Simon Keswick said the U.K. Market \"offers attractive opportunities for competitively priced food retailers\" and that \"a strategic investment in Kwik Save offers the best vehicle to pursue those opportunities.\"  \n',acq

'French industrial gas group Duffour et Igon has decided to back the takeover bid by Swedish industrial gases group Aga AB AGA.ST, ending a lengthy battle between rival bidders from France, Spain and West Germany, Duffour et Igon Chairman Jean Igon said.     The board agreed late last night to back the Aga bid and advise its shareholders to accept the Swedish group\'s latest offer of 4,410 francs per share, he tolds.     The other main bidders were Union Carbide Corp\'s UK. French subsidiary Union Carbide France and West Germany\'s Linde AG LING.F.     Aga topped rival bids for the gases distribution group in May by raising its offer to 4,410 francs from 4,000 francs.     This was accepted by Spain\'s Carburos Metalicos SA which sold Aga six pct of Duffour et Igon\'s stock and the right of first refusal on the remaining nine pct of stock it holds. It also won over the French Midi-Pyrenees development authority which agreed to sell Aga its 20 pct stake in Duffour et Igon.     Under Aga\'s offer, shareholders can either accept a cash bid or exchange one share in Duffour et Igon for one bond of a nominal value of 4,410 francs with a 10 pct coupon issue by Aga France SA. The bond issue is guaranteed by the parent Aga AB.     The takeover battle for the Toulouse-based company, which controls eight pct of the French industrial gas distribution market, began on April 2 with an offer of 2,100 francs per share from Union Carbide France UK.     Aga\'s offer, which puts a price of 587 mln francs on the company, closes on June 24 and the results will be announced on July 21.     Duffour et Igon shares were quoted yesterday at 4,410 francs, with no buyers, after a series of suspensions during the takeover tussle. They traded at 856 francs on January 9 before the first suspension.  \n',acq
'Japan\'s little-known Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with, political analysts said.     MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S. And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians, they said.     \"The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,\" said one diplomatic source.     \"They are a potent political force,\" the diplomatic source said.     But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts said.     \"The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized,\" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida. \"Suddenly they\'re standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense, they\'re at a loss (as to) how to face the situation.\"     Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain\'s Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan\'s lucrative overseas telephone business.     The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now monopolizes the business.     It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists.     The ministry\'s stance has outraged both London, which has threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan\'s failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market.     Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan\'s car telephone and satellite communications market.     Much of MPT\'s new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates.     \"What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place,\" said James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc.     A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPT\'s authority, analysts said.     \"With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto legal framework,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell Whitten.     Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT\'s influence, the analysts said.     \"Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance of MPT,\" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group, he added.     The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System, analysts said.     MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal Savings System\'s ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks, they said.     Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT\'s obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized the ministry as feudal.     Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.     But many of the ministry\'s actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain, several analysts said.     \"The United States is really the odd man out,\" Abegglen said. \"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable view,\" he said.  \n',acq

'A quickly growing Texas-based distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs for Crazy Eddie Inc crzy, the leading New York City electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its founder has bid.     The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc em for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.     Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer electronics, the nation\'s biggest, at a time the fortunes of electronics retailers have sagged.     The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.     \"I have mixed feelings,\" said analyst Dennis Telzrow of Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. \"On the one hand it\'s probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?\"     \"It\'s a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,\" said analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a Minneapolis brokerage. \"Electronics retailing is very management concentrated; they\'d want to keep Crazy Eddie\'s management in place.\"     Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie\'s 31.3 million shares, it may be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its 7-dlr-a-share offer.     Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high 4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share in over-the- counter trading.      Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie\'s shares.     A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company\'s board has taken no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He would not comment on the new offer.     Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to consumers by cable television.     In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to 87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.     Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer, Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to assist in financing the balance.     Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same amount.     Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday to 9.50.  \n',acq

Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.     As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by Friday.     It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as foreign because of its New Zealand base.     The ETL cash offer values Monier\'s issued capital of 156.28 mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.     Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.     ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.     ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the shareholding in Monier was a long term investment.     ETL and its Feltex International Ltd associate have targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion and Monier fits well with this aim, he added.     Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.     He also said Monier will not now proceed with the one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.     As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex put and call option deal with Monier\'s major shareholder, Redland Plc RDLD.L, which gives Redland the choice of accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to 50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.     CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland taking the second option, resulting in the two companies running Monier as a joint venture.

Computerland franchise owners pay royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.     Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be reached for comment.     E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel Inc MAT and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.    Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like Businessland Inc BUSL.O and Tandy Corp\'s TAN Radio Shack stores. \"The name of the game now is outbound sales forces, customer service and customer support,\" said Levy of International Data.      Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up managment control of the company in 1985.     Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive officer, revamped the company\'s royalty plan, which help quell much of the franchisee dissent.      \n',acq

'The Justice Department said it asked the government to proceed cautiously on a plan allowing the nation\'s two largest intercity bus companies to merge their operations, a move one of the firms said may derail the deal.     Justice\'s opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger plan.     Greyhound officials tolds late today the company hoped for ICC action on the merger by tomorrow.     \"Greyhound Lines will go forward with the transaction only if it is permitted to assume immediate, unconditional control of Trailways\' operations and to integrate them with its operations,\" Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC, the federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers of interstate bus companies.     But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn down Greyhound\'s request to begin operating Trailways immediately.     \"The department has just begun to receive relevant information on Trailways\' financial condition and is in the process of assessing the correctness of the company\'s allegations,\" acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule said in comments submitted to the ICC.

'President Reagan\'s nominee as top policeman for the nation\'s securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets.     David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.     If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.     The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.     The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing.     The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street\'s most successful stock speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading.     But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in  securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some U.S. securities markets.     At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.     And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.     Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the SEC\'s ability to enforce U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.     Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies, eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency\'s review of hostile corporate takeovers.     Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.     In line with the views of other top administration officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations.     The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency\'s enforcement agenda during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.     Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission\'s current priorities.     The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.     The agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies, investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.     The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency, meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone.     By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the White House.     Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms.     The agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities.     It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.     Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to become the nation\'s 35th president.     Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon\'s first term and was Reagan\'s director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.  \n',acq

'A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd DMP.MO by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd TRP.TO may short-circuit Dome\'s restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.     Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire.     Analysts said TransCanada\'s bid signals Dome\'s debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome\'s debt plan.     Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations.     TransCanada\'s proposal \"amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto.     Calgary-based Dome\'s restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.     \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary.     TransCanada\'s announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said.     The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added.     \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said.     Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada\'s announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,\" he said.     Dome does not consider TransCanada\'s proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility\'s announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.     Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada\'s.     Gowland said TransCanada\'s offer is probably a fair price for the company\'s 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.     However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome\'s debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada\'s proposed offer.  \n',acq

'Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.     Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers, Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.     \"We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would insure that takeovers are properly financed,\" he said.     Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, Proxmire said.     In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC.     Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts.     Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days.     His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer.     To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced.     The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers.     Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.     He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve\'s 50 pct margin requirements.     The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.     \"When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it,\" Proxmire said.

Share market analysts said speculators were buying the stock on belief that Harcourt would bid for Reed in an effort to escape the unwelcome two billion dlr bid from Robert Maxwell\'s British Printing and Communication Corp BPCL.L.

'Corporate mergers and acquisitions in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had only a modest effect on the metropolitan area\'s economy, a leading business-backed organization said.     The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding communities had not.     Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but another 21 firms were added to the list.     Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco. During the period, only six located in the city achieved Fortune 500 status.     Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously hurt the economic climate of northern California.     However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were created during the period.     At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest of the United States and California.     Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news conference that the region had difficulties in persuading companies to locate there because of a fragmented local political system.     But he said that because of the amenities of living in San Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other metropolitan area.     \"It\'s a great place to run a business,\" he added, \"but it\'s a hell of a place to do business with government.\"     The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the restructuring activity.     Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp; Cooke and Rolm.     Companies that grew enough during the period to make the Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis, McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.     The study by the management consulting firm said that, partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth in San Francisco has slowed since 1980.     In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership had adversely affected some of the Bay Area\'s civic and charitable activities.  \n',acq
'A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) SANM.MN to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources in the Philippine food and brewery company said.     A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC\'s outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former chairman of both SMC and UCPB.     Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.     Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB\'s plans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach of fiduciary duties.\"     The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a government nominee on the company\'s board.     De los Angeles, who represents SMC\'s minority stockholders, asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by the company\'s board.     On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company\'s retained earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends.     De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt to equity ratio. He quoted SMC\'s chief financial director Ramon del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.     In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.     De los Angeles\' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC\'s Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp for a down payment on the shares. The loan assumption was again ratified by last week\'s board meeting.     An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by April 15.     \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said in a statement.     \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the government\'s expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added.     A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on Cojuangco\'s court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial.\"     Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United States citizen.     The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \"A\" shares, which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \"B\" shares which are available to foreign buyers.     SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by the A.Soriano group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.     The sale was aborted when Diaz\'s Presidential Commission on Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend announced last June.     \"We have no objection to Soriano buying the \"B\" shares,\" Diaz tolds. \"But everything is on hold now.\"     The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company\'s annual stockholders\' meeting, scheduled for May 14.     San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in 1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of 700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.  \n',acq
'Sweden\'s Sandvik AB SVIK.ST and Diamant Boart SA of Belgium, in which Societe Generale de Belgique BELB.BR holds an indirect 52 pct stake, have finalised negotiations on merging oil and gas drilling tool activities, officials of both companies said.

'The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a takeover attempt by Campeau Corp.     In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau\'s takeover offer.     Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.     On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had urged rejection of Campeau\'s Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said.     Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied\'s SEC filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.     Securities law requires takeover target companies to promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.     The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct of Allied\'s stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at thwarting Campeau, the SEC said.     Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an amended SEC filing, the agency charged.     Allied\'s first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct 3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint said.     DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or 48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes after it dropped its hostile tender offer.     The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.     The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal tender offer.     But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.     In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern, the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.     Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.  \n',acq

ASRN.AS said from July 1 it will own 20 pct of the shares of Europeesche Verzekering Maatschappij N.V., a fully-owned unit of Swiss insurer Union Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft.     Stad Rotterdam chairman Lucas van Leeuwen tolds it may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies are found to be sufficiently compatible.     Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact Europeesche made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at below the shares\' intrinsic value. He gave no precise sum.

'Sumitomo Bank Ltd SUMI.T is certain to lose its status as Japan\'s most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.     Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in October.     But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu tolds he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position.     \"We\'ll be back in position in first place within three years,\" Komatsu said in an interview.     He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo\'s profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand Sumitomo\'s branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak.     But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off.     Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank\'s large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch.     The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves.     \"They\'ve made bold moves to put everything in place. Now it\'s largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson.     Among Sumitomo\'s problems are limits placed on its move to enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.     Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.     \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.     But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.     \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so, we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three years, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.     Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home.     Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan\'s version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial from investment banking.     But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities.     \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust bank related. That\'s the kind of deregulation we want.\"     Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.     He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.      The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon, following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.     But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.     \"We don\'t want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years,\" he said.     Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.     The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.     \"It\'s (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said Kleinwort\'s Smithson.     \"After that, it\'s a question of absorbing and juggling around. It will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong.\"  \n',acq

Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another proposal from \"a substantial company\" and discussions with a third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a statement.     The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada\'s bid, but did not identify the companies involved in talks.     TransCanada, Canada\'s largest natural gas pipeline operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which would own and operate Dome\'s assets. TransCanada said the offer is to Dome management, not to shareholders.     Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada, totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed. It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.     Dome\'s statement said the TransCanada announcement \"violated the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered into with prospective purchasers\" and was apparently timed to prevent Dome from considering other proposals.     It said the TransCanada bid \"seems to require favourable and substantial taxation concessions from the federal and provincial governments.\" But Dome added that its management and financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.     TransCanada chief financial officer H.

'A spokesman for Unilever Plc UN.AS declined to comment on market rumours that it may be considering a bid for the U.S. Health care group The Gillette Co GS.N.     Gillette shares are traded on the over-the-counter market in London and this morning stood one dollar higher at 38 dlrs in response to the bid speculation. Unilever dipped 33p to 3,275 in a generally depressed U.K. Market.     Most analysts dismissed the rumours saying it was an old story, and one commented that it was \"utter rubbish,\" adding he thought Unilever would not be interested in Gillette.     Gillette shares rose sharply at the beginning of the month on Wall Street rumours that Sir James Goldsmith was building a stake in the company.     Gillette has been the subject of repeated rumours since Ronald Perelman, chairman of the Revlon Group Inc REV, made an unsuccessful bid for the company last year.  \n',acq

The Stauffer sale prospectus has been sent in recent weeks to a number of companies expressing interest.

Unilever aquired Chesebrough for 3.2 billion dlrs in order to benefit from its well-known toiletry brands and food products.  \n',acq
'A congressional study today said the proposed, but now apparently abandoned, merger of the Communications Satellite Corp CQ and Contel Corp CTC would technically be legal but could violate the spirt of the law setting up COMSAT.     Two weeks ago before the study was completed, Contel announced it would seek to terminate the proposed merger.     The study by the non partisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) said \"the proposed merger appears to comply, technically, with the mandates or letter of statutes, if may nevertheless violate the spirit of the law.\"     Comsat, created by a 1962 act of Congress, and Contel, a corporation of local telephone and communications firms, filed with the Federal Communications Commission last November 3 an application for merger. Several firms had protested the proposed merger.     In an analysis of the law, the research service issued several critical comments about the structure of the new firm and said apparent domination by Contel of a restructured COMSAT would have broken the spirit of the law setting up COMSAT.COMSAT is the U.S. arm of Intelstat, the international satellite communications firm.   ...^M \n',acq
