'President Jose Sarney today declared \"a war without quarter\" on inflation and said the government would watch every cent of public expenditure.     Sarney, addressing his cabinet live on television, also reiterated that he intended to remain in power for five years, until 1990. There has been a long-running political debate about how long his mandate should be.     Brazil is currently suffering from the worst inflation of its history. In April monthly inflation reached 21 pct.  \n',cpi
'Canada\'s consumer price index rose 0.6 pct in May to 137.8, base 1981, following a 0.4 pct rise in April and a 0.5 pct rise in May 1986, Statistics Canada said.     The May year-on-year rise was 4.6 pct, compared with a 4.5 pct rise in April.  \n',cpi
'The European Community\'s annual inflation rate fell marginally to 3.2 pct in May from 3.3 pct in April, the EC\'s statistics office Eurostat said.     Prices in the 12-nation bloc rose 0.2 pct in May after 0.6 pct in April. But the annual rate stayed below that of the U.S. For the second month in succession, following the release of figures showing U.S. Inflation of 3.8 pct in both April and May.     However, Eurostat said the EC was still beaten by Japan, where prices were provisionally 0.1 pct lower in May than a year earlier.  \n',cpi
'Federal Reserve Board Vice-Chairman Manuel Johnson said the inflationary expectations in the financial markets have eased since the Fed\'s last half-point increase in its discount rate to 6.0 pct.     \"We have seen the kind of expectational forces develop I think that we\'ve been satisfied with since our last discount rate move,\" Johnson said.     Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said the most recent discount rate increase on September 4 was largely aimed at quelling inflationary fears in financial markets which he said were largely unfounded.  \n',cpi
'French retail prices rose a confirmed 0.2 pct in May compared with a 0.5 pct rise in April and 0.2 pct in May last year, the National Statistics Institute (INSEE) said.     The rise took the year-on-year inflation rate to 3.4 pct in May from 3.5 pct in April, and brought cumulative inflation over the first five months of this year to 2.0 pct compared with 0.7 pct for the same period of 1986.  \n',cpi
'Hungary has announced sharp price increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.     The official MTI news agency said the government decided consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average 18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.     The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated economy, and could help dampen Hungarians\' appetite for imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive hard currency, the diplomats said.     The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in other East Bloc states, notably Poland.     MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive, with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including higher pensions and family allowances.  \n',cpi
'New Zealand\'s consumer price index, CPI, which measures the rate of inflation, rose 2.3 pct in the quarter ended March 31 against an 8.9 pct rise in the December 1986 quarter and a 2.3 pct rise in the March 1986 quarter, the Statistics Department said.     For the 12 months ended March 1987 the CPI rose 18.3 pct against 18.2 pct in 12 months ended December 1986 and 13.0 pct in the 12 months ended March 1986, it said in a statement.     Nearly half the increase in the latest quarterly index was contributed by the housing group, the department said.     The December quarter was significantly affected by the introduction of a 10 pct value added goods and services tax, GST, in October 1986, it added.     However, some GST charges not measured in the December 1986 quarter influenced the latest March quarterly figure, it said.     This is because of an unavoidable lag in price information, particularly on housing, used cars and insurance on household contents, it added.  \n',cpi
'Consumer prices in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rose 0.3 pct in February and inflation rose to 2.4 pct year-on-year, the OECD said in a communique.     The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working their way out of the index. The February increase was less than Janauary\'s 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for the later months of 1986.     Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in January was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year.      Retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct, less than January\'s 1.1 pct increase. Energy prices for consumers were still nine pct lower than a year earlier, it said.     Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 pct in February, in line with previous months, although there has been some acceleration noticeable in the U.S. And Britain.     Among the leading seven industrial countries, consumer price inflation was highest in Italy at 4.2 pct, followed by Canada at 4.0 pct, Britain at 3.9 pct, France at 3.4 pct, the U.S. At 2.1 pct and West Germany and Japan with negative rates of 0.5 pct and 1.4 pct respectively.  \n',cpi

It said accumulated inflation for the first five months of this year was 33.8 pct against 24.1 pct for the same period in 1986.     Inflation for the year ending May 1987 was 75.7 pct compared to 76.8 pct for the year ending May 1986.  \n',cpi
'The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government implements an employers\' association recommendation for a 10 pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.     The government\'s own proposal for an across-the-board daily pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.     The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).     The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4 pct if the government\'s recommendation is implemented, Solita said. Both were proposed last month.     Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct by the National Economic and Development Authority early this month.     In the first three months of the year, inflation was a negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5 and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National Statistics Office said.     The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct in July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September respectively, the National Statistics Office said.     It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water prices.     The government\'s six and eight peso wage increases would displace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the number of unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.  \n',cpi
'Portugal\'s consumer prices rose 1.4 pct in March after a one pct increase in February and a 1.2 pct rise in March 1986, the National Statistics Institute said.     The consumer price index (base 100 for 1976) rose to 772.0 from 761.3 in February and compared with 703.4 in March 1986.     This gave a year-on-year March inflation rate of 9.8 pct against 9.5 pct in February and 12.2 pct in March 1986.     Measured as an annual average rate, inflation in March was 10.9 pct compared with 11.1 pct in February. The government forecasts annual inflation of about eight pct this year.  \n',cpi

'South Africa is expected to unveil tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year in a bid to boost the nation\'s flagging economic growth rate, economic analysts said.     Faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is expected to raise significantly the government\'s overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament, the analysts said.     Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.     \"Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,\" said Rob Lee, chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.     South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct.     Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5 pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over 30 pct.     Economists estimate that the government\'s spending target will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of GDP.     The government, having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget, analysts said.     \"The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,\" said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.     Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets.     South African Mutual\'s Lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49 billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5 pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the IMF.     \"The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,\" predicted one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past two years.     The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in September 1985.     Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation, government officials say economic growth is the prime objective.     But private-sector economists caution that the government\'s ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the current account of the country\'s balance of payments.     Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5 billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the nation\'s estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks.     Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has little room to manoeuvre.     Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and South African Transport Services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.     Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.     \"This will not be a very exciting budget,\" commented Harry Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive Federal Party. \"I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the sweets were given out before the election.\"  \n',cpi
