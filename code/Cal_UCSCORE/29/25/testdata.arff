@data'Asian cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.     \"Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product,\" said a spokesman for Indonesia\'s directorate general of plantations. \"We\'re happy about our long-term future.\"     Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable for European tastes.     They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices.     London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids.     Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia\'s Cocoa Growers\' Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe.     A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.     \"When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to talk down prices,\" the spokesman said.     He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.     PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the Netherlands and Britain.     The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as \"trade politics\" and said Jakarta\'s traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports.     Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia\'s two biggest commodity producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).     Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.     This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country\'s largest cocoa growing area.     Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes this year as young trees mature.     Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries.     According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.     Some traders believe the main quality problem is with harvesting and fermentation techniques.     One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian estates.  \n',cocoa
'Brazilian cocoa exporters are not likely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA, members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to boost world prices, trade sources said.     They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans.     \"The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in Brazil operate at their own free will,\" a trade source said.     The traders were responding to questions whether they would follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.     The sources said the Banco do Brasil\'s Foreign Trade Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment criteria.     \"The position of local producers is always to negotiate as they please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think it\'s a good deal, they are free to go ahead,\" one source added.  \n',cocoa
'Brazil is not selling cocoa beans to the International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock, as spot prices for beans in the interior area are 20 to 25 pct higher than levels which would be paid by the ICCO buffer stock manager, trade sources in the major producing state Bahia said.     The scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought on the current temporao harvest has pushed prices well above international levels, the sources noted.     The only buyers are bean exporters or local processors covering previously contracted commitments, they added.     If sales were made they would be executed by individual exporting companies which are members of the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission, they said.  \n',cocoa
'Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said.     The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday.     They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices.     Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon.     Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules.     The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.     \"The world\'s cocoa price at present is just not interesting,\" commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.     Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year\'s harvest.     The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the world\'s number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards.     The CPA includes the world\'s top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.     The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.  \n',cocoa
'Traders recently returned from West Africa say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases.     One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows.     So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted, only on an intermittent basis.     They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.     The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far, noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.     London traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference price).     However, little progress has been made in that direction, and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.     The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic, traders said.     Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers, they observed.     A report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities.     In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than 21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes. Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.     Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from Friday\'s close, basis July at its high of 1,271.     It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.  \n',cocoa
'The basic deposit on cocoa futures contracts will be reduced by 25 pct as from Friday, April 10, taking the required deposit for one 10 tonne lot to 300 stg from 400 previously, a spokesman for the International Commodity Clearing House (ICCH) said.     The deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut, to 150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously, he said.     The ICCH had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations over a period of weeks, he said, adding the market\'s basic stability had warranted a cut in deposit rates.     The decision to cut deposits was taken by the ICCH after consultation with the London Cocoa Terminal Market, the spokesman said.     The cuts were likely to attract more business to the market, he said.  \n',cocoa
'Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with the intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa Organization\'s buffer stock manager, industry sources tolds.     \"The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost nothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be actively depressing it,\" one company spokesman said.     Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.     Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the 1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.     \"Even before he started operations, traders estimated the manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level, and yet he appears reluctant to do so,\" one manufacturer said.     \"We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply step back,\" he added.     \"The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the market because everyone is holding back from both buying and selling waiting to see what the manager will do next,\" one processor said.     \"As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is about to alter his methods,\" he added.     Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock buying for some time to come.  \n',cocoa
'The buffer stock manager of the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) will tender for about 3,000 tonnes of cocoa beans Wednesday, June 3, the ICCO said in a statement.     It said all other conditions remain unchanged from the previous announcement.     These conditions are that offers from registered companies should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard differentials have been set in the ICCO\'s buffer stock rules, and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and spot to December arrival/delivery.     The basis position will be afloat, May/July shipment or June arrival/delivery. For later positions the appropriate carrying costs will be taken into account.     The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case of offers emanating from the origins.     The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking cocoa into store (currently 23.00 pounds sterling from \"cif landed\" and 38.00 pounds sterling from \"cif shipping weights\" to \"in store\") and the cost of carry which currently is 12.00 pounds sterling per month, the ICCO said.     No more than four offers will be considered from each offering party, it added.  \n',cocoa
'The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock manager bought 5,000 tonnes of cocoa today for the buffer stock, traders said.     The cocoa is believed to have been entirely made up of second hand material, they added.     Such a purchase would bring cumulative buffer stock purchases to 26,000 tonnes.  \n',cocoa
'Japan will ratify the 1986 International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA), with effect from July 1, and will renew its membership in the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO), Foreign Affairs Ministry officials said.     They said Japan would participate in an ICCO meeting on July 13 in London to revise ICCO buffer stock policy.     The 1986 ICCA has been in effect since January 1987.     Government approval to participate in the ICCO was delayed by parliamentary debate over the sales tax issue, the officials said.  \n',cocoa
'The West German cocoa grind rose 2.9 pct to 55,190 tonnes in the first quarter of 1987 from 53,643 tonnes in the same quarter of of 1986, the Bonn-based Confectionery Industry Association said in a statement.  TAW \n',cocoa

Grindings rose to 55,190 tonnes from 53,643 in the first 1986 quarter. A spokesman for the Confectionery Industry Association said that West German grindings are expected to stay relatively high in comparison to other West European countries.  \n',cocoa
'Brazil\'s coffee exports could amount to 19 mln bags this year, because of the excellent crop estimate of 35.2 mln bags, an IBC spokesman said.     He said exports could surpass the average annual 18 mln bags mark, especially if the final harvest to be conducted in October and November confirms the crop at over 35 mln bags.     He said the average limit of errors for the official crop harvest could be set at five pct above or below the first estimates officially published today.     He said the IBC agreed with a request by producers for the Institute to ask the government for a monthly indexation of the guarantee minimum price.  \n',coffee

'A Colombia government trade official has urged the business community to aggressively diversify its activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.     Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become what he called \"mental hostages\" to coffee, traditionally Colombia\'s major export.     The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987 coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.  \n',coffee
'Colombia\'s coffee export registrations remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered, Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters\' association said.     \"The philosophy of the new policy is not to close registrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed,\" he tolds.     On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and May for an unlimited amount.     Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6, or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the average in recent years.     He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national coffee growers\' federation at about the same, meaning a total of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by Colombia.     \"The only change that could happen is, because of the volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations would be for June shipment, etc\" Arango said.  \n',coffee
'A U.S. government trade official responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.     Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.     \"There is one country which evidently still does not,\" Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.     Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.     He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical discussions with Colombian officials.     While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe, Cardenas left a \"positive letter,\" Rosenbaum said.     The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns with the technical details of the Colombian plan.     Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by European coffee roasters and traders.     Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.     The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas unless \"objective criteria\" which reflect recent changes in the coffee market are used to set export limits.  \n',coffee

'Consumer countries should not intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas, Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said.     \"Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of producers as has been traditional,\" Dauster, a delegate at the recent coffee symposium here, told journalists. \"When consumers want to get involved, talks are much more difficult.\"     The main consumer country the United States and main producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in February.     Dauster said Brazil\'s role when the ICO meets in London in September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the hands of producer countries.     \"We have sacrificed a great deal already,\" he said. \"this year we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we are not in a position to do favours.\"  \n',coffee
'European coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.     Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.     The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil, the world\'s biggest coffee producer, an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement, van Horick said.     If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement, van Horick said.     Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil.     Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.     \"Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal leaves it very little to object to,\" van Horick said.     \"The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality,\" he said. \"Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone.\"     Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.     Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year\'s quota.     \"If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula, \" van Horick said.     At the same time much will depend on Brazil\'s attitude.     \"Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might just get an agreement,\" van Horick added.  \n',coffee

'The Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to submit details of past export performance in order that individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.     He tolds IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.     Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be used for calculating the export performace portion.     The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers participation and use this as a basis for allocation of individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.     He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate. Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export sales declaration form.     Auctions will not start until after the opening of export registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of the week, opening registraions from Monday.     A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the CNPC\'s export marketing committee to establish a system for allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels, the spokesman added.

'European coffee traders and roasters may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting here this week, traders and officials tolds.     Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the world\'s biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.     \"The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil\'s attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, \" one said.     However, the European coffee trade federation meeting, which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week, has revealed gaps in the European position on re-introducing quotas.     Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing countries.     The roasters said the positions were generally fairly close, and problems with some Government officials.     Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.     Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.     \"Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present a common European Community (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,\" one trader said.     \"We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,\" one official said.     \"We have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned,\" he added.     Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.     \"Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota re-introduction, \" he said.     \"The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors,\" one trader said.     \"However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota meeting in September,\" the official said.  \n',coffee
'A voluntary compliance system for monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and trade sources.     \"Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and  importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other,\" one analyst said.     On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.     Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification, it will still be allowed entry.     While many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls, trade sources said.     \"Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,\" a U.S. Customs spokesman said.     \"Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when its hands are tied, it doesn\'t have the authority to demand Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to destination),\" he said.     Many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system.     \"It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement,\" said one major U.S. roaster.      \"Last time we had a gentleman\'s agreement, the trade did not act as a gentleman,\" said another analyst adding, \"without the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the producers\' hands.\"     Some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market, in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount. Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely labelled.     According to customs officials, several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations, forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans.     \"If there\'s that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions,\" said Paine Webber analyst Bernie Savaiko.     Still, others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the U.S. in the near term.     \"It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee, I don\'t think that it poses that much of a threat,\" one trader said.  \n',coffee
'Uganda plans to export roasted coffee to Europe by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.     A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda\'s Ministry of Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind and pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in December and the factory should be ready by next October.     He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee Marketing Board to supply his company Unipack with 24,000 tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan from the Banque Industrielle d\'Afrique Oriental in Paris.     Uganda is the world\'s fifth largest coffee producer, and expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.     Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit Uganda\'s economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln (60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the latest International Coffee Agreement.     In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be substantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.     The U.S. Is the biggest buyer of Ugandan coffee, most of which is used to produce instant coffee.  \n',coffee
'Uganda\'s Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has stopped offering coffee on the international market because it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.     The board suspended offerings last week but because of its urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it could sustain, the sources added.     Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the Kenyan port of Mombasa.     Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by holding up remittance of Uganda\'s hard currency earnings from coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.     The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty for such delays, it added.     Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100 billion.     The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.     The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda\'s export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.     CMB officials have forecast that because the government has restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.  \n',coffee
'The quarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) continued without formal agreement on an extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA), but delegates said it was apparent there was a general consensus the Agreement should be prolonged.     Some delegations are still awaiting formal instructions from capitals, but informally most have indicated they favour an extension, delegates said.     This afternoon\'s session was used by delegates to seek further clarification on some of the issues involved, and to discuss internal matters.     Some sources were optimistic a resolution on an extension could be passed tomorrow but others suggested a special session would be convened to adopt the resolution after the Association of Tin Producing Countries meeting April 14 to 16.     The full Council session resumes tomorrow at 1330 GMT after a European Community coordination meeting at 1100.  \n',tin

It said it was not ready yesterday to take a stand but did not say why.     He added nine other EC states backed an extension. Spain and Portugal, which are not members of the International Tin Council, raised no objections to a common EC stance in favour.  \n',tin
'The International Tin Council, ITC, intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent the presentation of internal Council documents as evidence.     The intervention in Shearson Lehman\'s action against the London Metal Exchange over its \"ring out\" of tin contracts in 1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which the Council is involved following the collapse of its buffer stock operations in October 1985, ITC delegates said.     The ITC\'s case is being presented by Professor Rosalyn Higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next week. Court does not sit tomorrow.     In essence the Council is claiming that its status is similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can therefore not be used in an English court of law.     The Council ended its quarterly session today ahead of schedule. The meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow when the European Community\'s legal advisers were due to attend, but delegates reviewed the progress of the various legal actions today.     Otherwise, the meeting was occupied with internal administrative matters, delegates said.     The ITC will continue to operate with a reduced staff after June 30 following the two year extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement.     As well as dealing with the ongoing litigation, the Council will continue with its statistical work and carry out some research studies, although staffing in the research department is being cut to one from two previously.     At this week\'s session the Council elected Philip Sparkes of Australia as first vice-chairman for the producing members and Heinz Hofer of Switzerland as second vice-chairman for the consumers for the year from July 1. Future quarterly sessions are scheduled for October 5/7 and December 14/16.  \n',tin
'Malaysia is to urge fellow tin producing countries to contribute more money towards research into new uses for the metal, Malaysian primary industries minister Lim Keng Yaik tolds in an interview.     Lim, in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America, said he had instructed Malaysia\'s representatives on the executive committee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, to draw up a paper on the matter.     Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner Frans Andriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes.     He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposals for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be defeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea.     Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax was adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result, they would be compensated through access to the EC for alternative exports.     \"Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannot see how this would work out in our case,\" Lim said.     Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250 mln dlrs a year.     The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPC meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.     \"Not enough research and development effort has been put in by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes such as aluminium, paper and plastics,\" Lim said.     He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an exciting possible new application.     Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the new paper was produced.     He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamental barriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new International Rubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accord into some EC languages are still being awaited.     Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia\'s behalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said it was important there should not be a long \"interregnum\" between the old agreement lapsing in October and the new one coming into force.     He described the present accord as a model for commodity agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and control over buffer stock management.  \n',tin
'The Association of White Metals has decided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per 100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said.     The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for some French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals association said.     Today\'s price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and Tuesday\'s at 4,790.     The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a tin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tin trading on October 24, 1985.     The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a French franc price over the last few months to ensure it was reliable, the spokesman said.     The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railway station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.     The French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals groups various metal associations including the Association of White Metals.  \n',tin

Reported high grade tin business in London was confined to end April metal at 4,225 stg.

'Discussions on the possible extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA) began at the quarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) but the Council is still waiting for decisions from various member states.

Earlier today European Community (EC) members decided to back an extension, with the exception of Britain, which undertook to communicate its decision to its EC partners later.     Delegates said it could be Friday before all the member countries declare their positions on the possible extension. Today\'s full Council session started shortly before 1500 GMT after the scheduled 1330 start was delayed by an EC coordination meeting.

'Thailand\'s major tin exporter and producer Thailand Smelting and Refining Co (Thaisarco) said it may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because of insufficient supplies of tin concentrates from Thai mines.     Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to Thaisarco, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group RD.AS unit, to less than 20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonne average, commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard tolds.     He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to let the temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported tin lapse on June 3.     The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct this month from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lower levels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid the tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985.     Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a large portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100 tonnes per day.     As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some 3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the year ending February 1988.     Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC to allocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said.     The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however, because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a Mineral Resources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late this month, Yoot said.     The department said Thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tin during January/May compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago.  \n',tin
'Britain\'s highest court has decided the International Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC documents in court actions.     On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to what extent ITC documents, whether circulated or not, are admissible as court evidence. Lawyers working in the legal tangle left from the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said this hearing is likely to last a few days.     On Wednesday the Court of Appeal will link the outstanding ITC cases that have so far reached it and a single set of hearings could begin in early January, they added.     The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will be referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies against the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988.     The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers and cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the member governments of the tin council.     Action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the ITC or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by the Court of Appeal legal schedule.  \n',tin
'European free market tin traders made a somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October.     Traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin interests although European traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current \"free market\" system which has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin trading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.     There is also a view among European traders that, while the proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.     Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court litigation actions have been resolved.     Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten year low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as 4,680 stg in December 1986.     This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350 stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.     LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065 tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485 tonnes reached in February 1986.     Traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.     However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to 4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.     The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.     There was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.     Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks\' original tin holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved, and the bulk of material still available is being held by Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal.     Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the International Tin Council\'s, ITC, buffer stock manager halted support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members nations of the International Tin Agreement.     The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker Shearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin position.     Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter.     The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two major producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.  \n',tin

'Homestake Mining Co is considering acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company\'s exploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger tolds in an interview.

Conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than last year\'s spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year\'s 9.6 pct.     Conger said he sees Homestake\'s 1987 gold production about the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.

'Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd RGFJ.S (RGC) and explorer City Resources Ltd have agreed in principle on a joint venture to re-examine the Bulolo alluvial gold field in Papua New Guinea, City Resources said.

It said it believed Bulolo was not fully exploited in the past, noting the literature refers to heavy gold losses in tailings during dredging from 1931 to 1967 which produced a total of 2.1 mln ounces.

'Mining group Boliden AB said it had agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to exploit one of the world\'s richest deposits of the metal.     Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson tolds the Swedish group would  be responsible for the technical side of the operation and would have no control over the product itself.     He said one option under discussion for refining the gold ore would be to ship it to Boliden\'s Ronnskar copper smelter in northern Sweden.     Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it was strategically important since it increased Boliden\'s presence in Saudi Arabia.     \"Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the future,\" he said.     The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab in the west of the country and should open in the first half of 1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.     Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi Arabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to open in modern times.     \"This is a breakthrough for Boliden\'s sales of mining technology and knowhow,\" said the group\'s chief executive, Kjell Nilsson.  \n',gold

'Zimbabwe\'s beef exports to the European Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.     The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.     The outbreak in the country\'s main ranching province has already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export revenue.     \"The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of beef exports,\" one industry source said yesterday.      Commenting on EC policy, he explained, \"Depending on the seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are still awaiting their decision,\" he added, asking not to be identified.     Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.     Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.  \n',livestock

'An Iowa State University study showed pork contains considerably less fat than indicated by long-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said.     Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart Association guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained less than six pct fat, the NPPC said.     Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.     Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy between the study and the USDA handbook.     \"Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago, thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,\" Kline said.     The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money, evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat, moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.  \n',livestock
'The U.S. meat and poultry inspection programs are incapable of protecting consumers from contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and consumers charged.     \"The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated meat,\" Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.     \"The American consumer has little reason to feel confident about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him today,\" said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute.     \"Company management is less concerned about the risk to health than about raising plant output and company profits,\" Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.     Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose violations of federal law, demonstrating a \"serious breakdown in the entire inspection system.\"     Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being contaminated by \"intestines dragging in a water trough used to flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit, chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow their noses.\"     Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended the government\'s program, calling it \"one of the most respected public health programs in the world.\"     FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5 billion chicken and turkeys every year.     Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in the meat and poultry supply has increased.     He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time and much money to contain the growing problem.     Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.     The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20 years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.     \"We certainly really have not found an effective means of turning this disease around,\" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)     The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for detecting microoganisms.     But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls would cost too much.     \"Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and economical meat supply for consumers,\" Stanley Emerling, executive vice president of the National Association of Meat Purveyors, said.     Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at certain plants \"voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor legal recourse.\"     Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.  \n',livestock

China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) would have 75 pct of the equity in Bohai Aluminium Industries Ltd, the company to build the rolling mill and extrusion plant on the northeast China coast, they said.     It was China\'s largest joint venture so far, they said.     \"A joint venture opens up the potential for penetrating markets that would not otherwise be possible (for China),\" Victoria state treasurer Rob Jolly said.     An Australian diplomat said CITIC was eager to pursue South Korean markets. Indirect trade between China and Seoul is growing but is not officially publicised.     Victoria\'s Aluvic Ltd, on behalf of the state government, will hold a 25 pct equity stake in the project, which is intended as a sister plant to Victoria\'s Portland aluminium smelter. CITIC in May agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs in Portland.     The China-based joint venture would process Portland aluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domestic Chinese market as well as for export, Jolly said.

'Indonesia has increased its share in a 434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with Japan from 25 to 37 pct, Asahan Project Authority director A.R. Suhud said.     The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised its share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company, capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen in government loans to the company for an equity stake.     The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24 billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.     Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between 1982 and 1985.

Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to about 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.

The government and private interests will equally share the additional investment, he said.     They will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen in new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in Brazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested.     The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct, the official said.     Interest rates on loans by Japan\'s private banks to the two projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the current seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to be reached, industry sources said.     Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billion yen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32 billion yen to the company.

'China will not increase sugar imports substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints and large stocks, despite falling production and rising domestic demand, traders and the official press said.     \"Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to be extremely serious,\" the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986 plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.     The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.     The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500 tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.     The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the area under sugar was dropping.     \"Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,\" the newspaper said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane is a major problem.\"     A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian, south China\'s fourth major producer, where there was a drop in area planted.     He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.     The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667 hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only 70 from one mu of sugarbeet.     The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to 4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.     Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.     The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the official press has said.     Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.     The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.     A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986 when the central government resumed control of imports.     \"As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,\" the diplomat said.     The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly as coal had priority. \"How quickly they can move the sugar is one factor determining import levels,\" he said.     Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba, China\'s major supplier through barter trade, he said.     \"China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about 152/153 dlrs a tonne,\" he added. \"China is not a desperate buyer now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into the open market.\"     A Japanese trader said Peking\'s major concern regarding imports was price.     \"While the foreign trade situation has improved this year, foreign exchange restraints persist,\" he said.     The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five pct a year but \"a communist government is in a much better position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the foreign exchange situation demands it.\"  \n',sugar
'Cold and wet weather in northern, western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.     Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields.     But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth.     Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet development, Licht said.     In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal.     In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.     In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible.     In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was favourable for beet growth, Licht said.     In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.     In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union, it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.     In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development.     Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where beets are maturing very early this year.  \n',sugar
'Roughly half of this year\'s expected 130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground, a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the Netherlands, tolds.     Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April 23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman added.     \"It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start,\" he said.     Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the country\'s combined \"A\" and \"B\" quota of 872,000 tonnes.     This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota \"C\" sugar produced.     Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.  \n',sugar

Some said they believed the tonnage would probably be smaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a view on the likely restitution. Last week, the European Commission accepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators protesting about low rebates.

'The maximum export rebate granted at yesterday\'s EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC Commission sources said.     The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for 118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.     Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week, the sources said.     They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from operators protesting that rebates are too low.     Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar. But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless the Commission reviews its export policy, they said.  \n',sugar

'Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.     Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record 501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December) crop year.     The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced 486,790 tonnes.     For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.     Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills by June 23.     Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June 23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.     The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the full amount of the grower\'s share of 1986 sugar proceeds received to-date. The balance will be paid in October.     Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of 23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.     However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of 14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane harvested by November 30, he said.     Ganilau said, \"This will be at least one month in advance of the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the end of crushing.\"     Another demand of Fiji\'s 22,000 small farmers was that an estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off. The FDB rejected this request.     Ganilau said, however, \"The bank is prepared to carefully consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of hardship on a case-by-case basis.\"     In response to a further demand that all soldiers be removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army would restrict its presence in the cane areas.     He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the commencement of harvest.     Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible, he added.  \n',sugar

They expected a maximum rebate of between 46.40 and 46.50 Ecus per 100 kilos, compared to last week\'s 46.864.     Earlier, traders in London said the outcome of the tender was very hard to predict after last week\'s substantial award and the placing of 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.

'New Zealand has imposed sanctions against Fiji in response to that country\'s change of status to a republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said.     The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut economic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in March. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about 10 mln dlrs a year.     Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the government had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from Suva for discussions about other possible measures.     \"We won\'t be reacting further until these discussions with the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,\" Palmer said.

'Good rains of one to four inches in the past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland\'s central coast, an Australian Sugar Producers\' Association spokesman said.     As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet season.     Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.     Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.     Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.     Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled towards the end of May, he said.     The cane crush normally runs from June to December.  \n',sugar
'A sugar mill which was this nation\'s second largest employer closed its doors yesterday, saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.     The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO) will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to 40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital, the company said.     \"Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane after April 10,\" the mill warned planters earlier this week.     Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.     At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound (45-kg) bags of sugar.     \"We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar. We have no money left to continue operations,\" Rigaud said.     He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.     Rigaud blamed the mill\'s problems on an order by Duvalier two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.     He said the government then began importing refined sugar at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and the provisional military-civilian government that replaced Duvalier last year continued the policy.     \"But now with all the smuggling even the state can\'t compete with smuggled Dominican refined sugar,\" Rigaud said.     HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.     It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO\'s closing at a minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.     Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. \"We\'re dead, and it\'s the government that\'s causing us to die,\" declared Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.  \n',sugar

'British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a inquiry     Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the factory\'s catchment area from harvesting, and last week\'s hurricane which blocked roads.     The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are cleared and supplies of beet build up again.     This is the first time in many years that a factory has been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.     Other factories are continuing to process beet normally, but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.     Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.     Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2 mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the spokesman said.     British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.     The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month, is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the campaign.     As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13 pct had been lifted.

Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.     Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.     In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.     President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.     The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia\'s IMF austerity program.     Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile region to take action against shops that did not reduce their prices after today\'s deadline. Fifteen people were killed in the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the government tried to lift maize subsidies.  \n',copper
'Zambia\'s copper mining industry is hoping to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a year in the next few years despite low world prices, deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry officials said.     But Zambia\'s decision to abandon last May 1 a tough International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.     Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.     \"We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due to greater availability of spares and equipment,\" a ZCCM official said.     ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.     Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes higher than the previous year and the best production achieved to date.     Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper industry in Zambia, the world\'s fifth biggest producer. Mining is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the country\'s foreign exchange earnings.     Production has also been seriously affected in recent years by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of spare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.     A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984 by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African Development Bank and the World Bank.     The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.     ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as part of the plan.     More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under the five-year restructuring plan.     Company officials said although reserves were being depleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the end of the century, though at lower levels of production.     Industry sources said ZCCM\'s projected pre-tax profit for the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being levied, a net loss is likely to be registered.     ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.     Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in 1985, ZCCM\'s profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over two to the dollar.     But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund, and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic strategy based on national resources.     ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the break with the IMF will have on the industry\'s plans.     \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare under the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, tolds.     Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM\'s export profits.     \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.     High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian industry.     Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69 cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States and under 40 cents in Chile.     The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had stopped sBending copper south through South Africa.     Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while 5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira. Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and fuel.  \n',copper
'Developing countries said the European Community (EC) would breach two international agreements if it went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.     Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the exports of 26 ACP countries.     They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect trade between the two sides.     They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.     The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could raise up to two billion Ecus a year.     EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax, are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on June 15.     Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its member country exports.     \"We can\'t believe the EC would willingly take measures to undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these measures,\" Wilson said.     The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it is approved.     Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only \"as a very last resort,\" but added that the ACP is in touch with other countries which oppose the plan.     Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats.     Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast, Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.  \n',veg-oil
'The European Community\'s farmers\' pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax which has already been proposed by the EC Commission.     Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on Tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism for cereal substitutes.     He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the Danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair meetings of their EC colleagues.     Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help the EC\'s budget problems and would provide some price stability for producers.     This would in turn help the market position for certain crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe output restrictions.     A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats succeeded in blocking the idea during this year\'s annual EC price fixing.     However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its proposals for a tax.     Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of bridging the gap between EC and world prices.  \n',veg-oil
'Dutch parliamentary parties have re-affirmed their support for the government\'s opposition to the proposed European Community tax on oils and fats, parliamentarians said.     A broad cross-section of members of parliament voiced their opposition to the tax during a debate in the lower house yesterday on the basis of possible retaliation from the U.S. And on the potentially damaging effect on Third World countries.     State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Rene Van Der Linden said the government was against the tax although it noted deepening EC financial difficulties.     \"It is difficult to be against the tax and against extra finance. The EC members have to make a choice,\" Van Der Linden said.     However, he denied the government had dropped its opposition to the proposed tax or altered its position.  \n',veg-oil
'A spokesman for the European Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.     Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission\'s Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days \"the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy.\"     The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.     Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0 billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community\'s \"standstill\" agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement.     The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system, he added.     Under the Commission\'s system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe said.     Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level.     He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy\'s oils and fats regime.     \"The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,\" he said.     Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.     It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.     EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements, he said.     The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax, Tanghe said.     The proposed system would not alter the EC nations\' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand, he said.     It is one of the proposal\'s objectives to maintain current import levels, he said.     Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the EC\'s cakes and meals requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system. Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.  \n',veg-oil
'European Community agriculture ministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of a two-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attempt to agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an EC Commission spokesman said.     He added that tomorrow\'s EC Official Journal will contain notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical nature which will come into effect on July 1 unless the ministers reach an accord.     The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but said they would not be the sort of \"dynamic\" moves which EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in the case of complete deadlock among farm ministers.     These moves would be taken only if tomorrow\'s meeting of ministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord, EC sources said.     Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices by seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sources said.     EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 still split over the Commission\'s proposal for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats.     In addition, West Germany said it would veto plans for cereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency system.

'Belgium, current holder of the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop a controversial oils and fats tax from this year\'s hotly-contested farm price package, diplomats said.     In a discussion document prepared for today\'s summit meeting of EC leaders, Belgium proposed the so-called \"stabilising mechanism\" be the subject of \"further study and consultation with the Community\'s main trading partners.\"     The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne on both imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marine oils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism.     The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row at the summit and breaking the deadlock at this year\'s farm price talks, contained the first formal reference to dropping the measure.     Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency on June 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They are supported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Spain.     Although the paper was not universally welcomed, diplomats said, the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for a further six months was certain to survive any redrafting.  \n',veg-oil
'A specially convened Franco-German meeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed to make any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that has deeply split the two former EC allies, diplomats said     The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign ministers from both countries and by French President Francois Mitterand, his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, and by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany.     The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the Community\'s worst-ever budget crisis.     \"The Germans clearly do not want to budge,\" an aide to Chirac told reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visibly angered as he the hour-long meeting.     Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the EC\'s complex \"green\" currrency system, designed to translate common EC farm prices into national currencies.     Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which West Germany is against, along with Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands.     EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the package, which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline tomorrow.     Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have injected fresh impetus into those talks.     The Commission proposed its package to save one billion dollars on the EC\'s ever-rising farm budget.     The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group, and plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987.  \n',veg-oil
'The rate of increase in world palm oil use is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000 tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke, editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.     He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that in the next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to 8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year average increase of 550,000 tonnes.      Opening stocks at the start of next October are expected to be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlier levels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.     The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnes above this season\'s available amount, Mielke said.     The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia will slow down from this year on, but that will be offset by area expansion in Indonesia, he said.     He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesian mature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, and at 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.     Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak, where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula, but where yields are lower, he said.      The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is also expected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean, cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and palm.     At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were unusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current season\'s prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago and with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.     Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start of next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by the end of next season.     The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last October and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 at the end of next season, Mielke said.     World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the course of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in soybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln tonnes or by one fifth.     Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S., for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln tonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks of 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this season.  \n',veg-oil

'Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO) prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree crops, told Indonesian reporters.     Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332 dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.     Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it could possibly increase its international market share.     Indonesia, the world\'s second largest producer of palm oil after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.     Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary shortage than to lose export markets.     Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500 tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank figures.  \n',veg-oil
'The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian Nainggolan said.     He tolds in a telephone interview that trading in palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.     Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil may also be introduced. But he said the question was still being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no decision on when to go ahead had been made.     The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.     \"Several factors make us move cautiously,\" Nainggolan said. \"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.\"     Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward, exchange officials said.     The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one official said a feasibility study was needed first. No decisions are likely until after Indonesia\'s elections on April 23, traders said.     Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the world\'s second largest producer of natural rubber, should expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of the exchange would help this.     Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.     He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to encourage participation.     Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start although trading in coffee has been disappointing.     Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9 mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered locally, the latest exchange report said.

'The United States and India have not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the drought-stricken Asian country, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.     Lyng tolds in an interview that the two countries have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi\'s visit here this week.     \"We have been talking about the potential needs that India might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs as well as the possibilities of assistance,\" Lyng said.     \"At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. The amounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we have indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in whatever way they deem most valuable,\" he said.

Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree on the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and that Washington would prefer the package include something other than donated food.     \"The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking care of themselves. India is a country that has come a long way in its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in that,\" Lyng said.     \"We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses we still have of many commodities..., would like to share in the import business the Indians do, and then we have some, as we always do, compassion for the people of India and would like to cooperate with them,\" he said.

'Malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987, oil palm growers tolds.     Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes, unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms, they said.     The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysia\'s oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year.     Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry, a leading grower tolds.     The country\'s palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes against about 800,000 last March, the growers said.     The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.     The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean, is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous 21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.     In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil output peaks.     They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow, with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years.  \n',veg-oil

'Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community (EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.     \"I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the Philippines,\" Romero said in an interview.     He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position.     Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.     Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.     He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.     Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground.     Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally, but this was likely to take several years of research.     Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.     Romero said he would also visit Oxford University\'s department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether.     \"There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra,\" Romero said. \"We can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to the chemical root.\"     He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop.     \"In the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production, and I\'m not comfortable with that,\" he said.     With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.     \"To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,\" he said.     Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents, and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.     Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests.     He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to add to the production fall, drought had affected output.     \"Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing, adding more value,\" he said.     Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.     \"A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on 10,000 square metres of land. That\'s a lot of space,\" Romero said. He said the government\'s proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.     \"If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels, production and employment then it won\'t happen,\" he said.     PCA figures show about one-third of the country\'s population is dependent on the coconut industry.     Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or one-fourth of total agricultural land.  \n',veg-oil

'A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for soybeans should help boost 1987 U.S. Soybean exports to Taiwan, a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers tolds.     He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by the cabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.     The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987 soybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, he said. The previous target for 1987 was 1.81 tonnes.     Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from the U.S. And the rest from South America.     The spokesman said the increase in imports from the U.S. Is in line with government efforts to reduce Taiwan\'s trade surplus with Washington, which rose to 3.61 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year ago.     \"The tariff cut is very helpful for American suppliers (who want) to boost their exports to Taiwan,\" Steve Chen, country director of the American Soybean Association, tolds.  \n',veg-oil

'At least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240 mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the past few months, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said, quoting an official in the National Food Authority (NFA).     The official, who was not named, said a large corn shortage and corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel have jeopardised the government\'s ban on corn imports, which was aimed at saving foreign currency.     The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan as saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnes against a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.     Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150 hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.     The newspaper quoted Linda Geraldez, an NFA statistician, as saying despite the drought and the shortage, the total inventory at the end of the January/June crop season is expected to be at least 201,000 tonnes.  \n',grain

'Australia could lose valuable wheat markets through lack of availability if plantings for the coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.     \"If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its valuable markets,\" he said in a statement.     Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.     However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were facing enormous financial pressures.     He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about 16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.     If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.     \"Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat understand a decrease in production due to drought but they will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to decrease production,\" Condon said.     \"If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export income earner, governments and government authorities will need to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing viability of the wheat industry,\" he added.

'Storage problems with Brazil\'s record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.     Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, tolds he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year\'s estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.     He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems.     Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop.     But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation\'s capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.     The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity.     Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation\'s grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space.     In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said.     Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops.     The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.  \n',grain
'U.S. House and Senate budget negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending on agricultural programs, Congressional sources tolds.     The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4 billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.     The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.     The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior Congressional aides tolds.     Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find the budget savings.     Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.     House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.     But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget savings Glickman claims.     Another area where Glickman and other have said budget savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program, ARP, levels for wheat and corn.     However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30 pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.     Congressional sources said the only way to achieve significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as unfair to one commodity.     Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most likely to eventually look for budget savings are some tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.     Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion but not enough, they said.     Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.     This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.  \n',grain

An additional 150,000 tonnes of wheat flour is still available to Iraq under the Export Enhancement Program initiative announced January 7, 1987, the department said.  \n',grain
'The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) accepted eight bonus offers from two exporters on sales of 190,000 tonnes of hard red winter and 35,000 tonnes of soft red winter wheat to Jordan, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The department said the bonuses awarded averaged 38.08 dlrs per tonne and the wheat is for delivery May-November, 1987.     The bonus awards were made to Louis Dreyfus Corp (200,000  tonnes), and Continental Grain Co (25,000 tonnes) and will be paid in the form of commodities from CCC stocks.

'There will be no serious bids at European Community open market tenders for wheat and barley until EC farm ministers agree to the 1987/88 farm price package, trade sources said.     The failure of farm ministers this week to come to an agreement resulted in no bids at this week\'s tender for export subsidies and traders said bids are unlikely as long as the uncertainty remains.     One trader said permanent damage to export prospects can be avoided if an agreemend can be reached soon, but the situation will become more serious as time passes.     However, traders said there seem to be few buyers around, lessening the disruptive impact of the delay.     Poland and South Korea, who are in the market for feed wheat, will be offered intervention grain through special tenders, traders said.  \n',grain
'French operators have requested licences to export 320,000 tonnes of free market barley, 225,000 tonnes of maize, 25,000 tonnes of free market bread-making wheat and 20,000 tonnes of feed wheat at today\'s EC tender, trade sources said.     For the barley, rebates of between 138 and 141.25 European currency units (Ecus) per tonne were sought, for maize they were between 129.65 and 139 Ecus, for bread-making wheat around 145 Ecus and for feed wheat around 142.45 Ecus.     Barley rebates of up to 138.50 Ecus were requested for a total of 40,000 tonnes and at 139 Ecus for 85,000 tonnes.

'The U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.     The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers\' Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or end-of-season stocks.     However, the officials said the USDA\'s figure of end 1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87\'s 2.87 mln was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.     The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.     This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around 31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.     ONIC\'s first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC official said.     Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.     He said, however, that among countries to which France could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.     The USDA\'s forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in 1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature, was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.     Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.     It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares, down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.  \n',grain
'Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.     They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.     However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.     Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.     There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.     Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean.     However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.     Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.     The season\'s sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln.     Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.     Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.     Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously.     This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes.     Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last season\'s 3.85 mln.     Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April.     The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.     The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season\'s 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop.     The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln.     The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86.     The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available.     Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.  \n',grain

'Indonesia rejected World Bank recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as the country\'s foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5 billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.     Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks distributed today as Indonesia\'s 14 foreign donor nations met at The Hague, said, \"The general argument presented by the Bank for this free trade, open economy view is weak.\"     The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural growth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.     The Bank report said Indonesia\'s rice production had peaked and the subsidies are a waste of money.     Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers, exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.     Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the government would continue to maintain production targets for \"strategic commodities\" such as rice and sugar.     The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia\'s drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country would save money by importing the commodity.     However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.     He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry develop and because of \"over-production and price intervention in the developed nations.\"  \n',grain

'Italy\'s barley crop is generally in good condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam said.     First consignments were expected to be available around mid-June.     Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia, which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop because of extreme dryness.     Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year\'s low levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.     Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national production would be around two pct higher than in the previous season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.     If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an increase of 11 pct compared to 1986.  \n',grain
'The Agriculture Ministry declined comment on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.     \"We have no idea about the report and cannot comment,\" a spokesman tolds.     Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources, said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for farm talks.     The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.     Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff Control Act.     Nihon Keizai said Japan\'s plan resulted from worries about mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is justified, it said.     The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade round last September. It will take four years to negotiate.  \n',grain

'The Soviets have not indicated an urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng tolds.     In an exclusive interview withs, Lyng said he did not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.     \"Last year it was well into the year before we offered it. There\'s been nothing that\'s taken place to indicate to me that there\'s a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a wheat subsidy).\"     When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet summit, Lyng said, \"No, I don\'t think so. I don\'t think that.\"     The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for discussion at a summit.     \"It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions about,\" Lyng said.     \"When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was not something that would be discussed with the President of the United States. He said it\'s not presidential,\" Lyng said.     Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.     The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the long-standing agreement.     \"We\'ve had three years in a row in which the Soviets have failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union, but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that. These are some of the questions we need to discuss.\"     When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from the agreement, Lyng said, \"I don\'t know. It certainly hasn\'t been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running they\'ve (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an agreement.\"  \n',grain
'Residents of central Oklahoma returned to their homes over the weekend after a week of heavy rains and severe flooding that left two dead and caused more than 20 mln dlrs in damage, officials said.     Some 900 people were evacuated from their homes during the rains and flooding last week, civil defense officials said.     Many of the shelters set up throughout the state in areas threatened by flooding, except those near the Washita and Red Rivers, closed as residents returned to their damaged homes.     Farmers who had expected a near-record wheat crop now say this year will see one of the largest losses in decades.     Gov. Henry Bellmon, who on Thursday declared a flooding emergency for central Oklahoma, was expected to ask President Reagan for federal disaster relief for the area.     In northern Texas, officials reported several tornadoes on Friday. A twister in Lubbock yesterday damaged six mobile homes and two houses. No injuries were reported.  \n',grain

'The Pakistani government allowed the private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy announced to cover the next three years.     Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn.     Cotton and rice are Pakistan\'s main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and rice along with the state corporations.     He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and to enable them to compete effectively in the world market. This would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.  \n',grain

'Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier this month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week, according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather Inc.     \"There is going to be more rain for the next two, three days,\" he said. \"We\'re in a fairly wet pattern with normal to above normal moisture this week.\"     Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.     Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.     Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.     \"Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a pretty good rain,\" Mohler said.     Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off 19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.     Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north later in the week.

A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan rate differentials to no more than one pct per year from the national average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.     The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary to increase the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by \"an appropriate amount to generate savings\" if projected corn stocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.

'Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S. farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they approve of the proposal.     The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.     Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings examining farm programs.     Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his \"Family Farm Act.\"     -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income and reduce government spending on agriculture.     -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would increase overall revenue from exports.     This would be done by seeking agreement among major exporting countries including the European Community on market sharing at agreed high prices.     Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing that such a grain export cartel is not workable.     -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices stem more from \"gouging\" by food processing companies than from high farm product prices.     Harkin cited what he termed \"excessive\" net returns on equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J. Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct Quaker Oats.     -- Harkin said a \"legitimate\" concern about his bill would be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.     He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp. grain stocks for three years.     Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a \"predictable and stable\" grain price, he said.     -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm participation would be no more \"mandatory\" than the current farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect farm income.  \n',grain

'Recent announcements from Moscow of next year\'s grain production targets indicate that the Soviets are estimating this year\'s grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes, Agriculture Department analysts said.     USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987 grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.     Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday, putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be \"25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.\"     \"This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213 mln tonne (grain) crop,\" the analyst said.         In calculating Moscow\'s crop estimate, USDA used the 235 mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure published in a Soviet economic journal this month.     USDA\'s production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.     Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.     While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be as good or better than last year\'s 210 mln tonne harvest.     A member of Nikonov\'s party commented that although 230 mln tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.  \n',grain

'The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last week\'s increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said.     Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died.     That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the government\'s subsidy bill.     However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF.     \"There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people,\" a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.  \n',grain
'The American Soybean Association (ASA) denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not remedy the situation.     ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored Outlook 87 conference: \"It will be filed unless the EC takes drastic and immediate steps.\"     \"These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal, since they were established after the zero soybean duty was established in 1962,\" he said.     The ASA\'s unfair trade petition against the EC would ask for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to make the regime non-discriminatory.     The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production has risen dramatically since then.     The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world market levels and is considering implementing a controversial oils and fats tax.     The subsidies \"are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,\" Adams said.     The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.     U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of EC policies, Adams added.     Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973 when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.  \n',oilseed
'Based on field travel in the Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.     The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazil\'s total soybean crop.     It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.     However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the report said.     The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems, the report said.     Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are expected to be above average, it said.     Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested.     During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the report said.     New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests.  \n',oilseed

'The Reserve Bank of India said it was tightening its credit policy for commercial banks by raising their cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct to 10 pct, effective from October 24.     The move, announced last weekend, is part of the bank\'s policy for the second half of fiscal 1987/88 ending March and is aimed at curbing excess bank liquidity.     The central bank also put selective controls on bank advances to the oilseeds, vegetable oils and foodgrains trades.     \"The policy\'s main objective is to fully meet the credit requirements of agriculture, industry and exports, while preventing excessive monetary expansion,\" bank Governor R.N. Malhotra told an earlier meeting of chief executives of banks.     Malhotra said the rate of monetary expansion must be kept under control in the second half of the current financial year.     Bank deposits rose 75.40 billion rupees in the first six months of fiscal 1987/88 against 66.92 billion in the same period last year, according to the bank.     Bankers said the bank\'s move to raise the cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct will mean impounding about five billion rupees from the banking system. Banks\' total deposits are estimated at around 1,000 billion rupees.     They said banks are under pressure because of low returns on commercial lending and investments in government securities.     \"Already many banks are finding it difficult to maintain their statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios and are resorting to heavy inter-bank borrowings,\" said one banker.  \n',oilseed

'Nearby months in soybean and soymeal futures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply of livestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep the new crop outlook bearish, traders said.     \"A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,\" one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.     Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a Decatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid another two cents today to 10 over July futures.     Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light, with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing to sell, dealers said.     Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief that even if futures rally back to last month\'s highs, country movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half of the Midwest.     Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the spot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.     Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal has already moved to a premium over the August through October months and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may also move to a July premium later this month, they added.  \n',oilseed

'The U.S. is drafting options including possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over the differential between soybean and product  taxes which Buenos Aires levies on exports.     The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S. officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina\'s differential export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in competition with the U.S.     \"Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict (Argentine) access to our market,\" said one U.S. source.         The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to end the differential.     But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88 year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.     Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not narrow the differential further for 1987/88.     As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.     A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan administration soon, they said.  \n',oilseed

'A proposal to require imported tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.     The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a 10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers\' hopes the plan would be adopted this year.     A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.     Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an amendment to a farm spending reduction package.     \"I don\'t see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving American consumers the information they need,\" he said.     Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.     The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.     But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal \"blatantly discriminates\" against imports, would be impossible to defend under international trade law and would harm relations with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.     Yeutter\'s letter also said Americans derive most of their saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively little from tropical oils.     The committee voted largely along party lines, with three Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.  \n',oilseed
