'At least 26 people died when a car ferry struck a pier as it left Belgium for Britain, a nurse who took part in the rescue operation said.     Jan Van Moerbeke, a male nurse, said on coming off the Herald of Free Enterprise that he had found six people on top of the vessel who were dead. There were at least another 20 dead inside the boat, he added.     The governor of West Flanders province said 240 people were still unaccounted for.  \n',ship

'An accord is in sight in Brazil\'s 20-day-old national seamen\'s strike, which has seriously delayed exports, a union official said.     The official, speaking from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, said up to 30,000 of Brazil\'s 40,000 seamen were still on strike.     He said the others had returned to work over the last week, accepting pay offers of 120 pct from four private companies and from the Frota Nacional de Petroleiros (Fronape), part of the state-owned oil company Petrobras.     The association grouping private shipowners, Syndarma, has also offered 120 pct but talks have so far been deadlocked over payment for overtime.     The union official said he believed this issue would be resolved shortly.  \n',ship

'Australian trade unions said they have launched week-long strikes and other industrial action in New South Wales (NSW) to protest against new laws that would reduce injury compensation payments.     Union sources said talks with the state government broke down last night, but the two sides are scheduled to meet later today in an attempt to find a compromise.     Rail freight and shipping cargo movements in the country\'s most populous state were the first to be affected, and union officials said almost every business sector will be hit unless there is a quick settlement.     The state government recently introduced a new workers\' compensation act which would cut the cash benefits to injured workers by up to a third. The act is now awaiting parliamentary ratification.     NSW state premier Barrie Unsworth has said workers\' compensation has risen steeply in recent years and the proposed cuts would save hundreds of mlns of dollars a year.     Union officials said industrial action could spread to other states as the federal government also plans to make sharp cuts in workers\' compensation.  \n',ship
'British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc BCOM.L said that it would reorganise its commercial and service operations into a single public grouping with autonomous management.     The group has expanded rapidly in the past year through the 672.5 mln stg acquisition of Exco International Plc and 90 mln bid for Steel Brothers Holdings Plc.     It noted that its operations were now divided between financial services, including money broking, investment management and forfaiting, and more traditional areas such as aviation, hotels, commodity trading and office equipment.     It said that each sector had exciting prospects but required different methods of management and financing.     B and C planned to form a new public company to hold the commercial operations and envisaged it operating with a capital of between 400 mln and 600 mln stg.     It has retained Barclays de Zoete Wedd to advise on the introduction of independent investors to subscribe for additional capital, and believes that the proportion of equity capital held by outside investors would not exceed 20 pct of the total.     The statement said that with the continued support of B and C, together with outside capital, the new grouping would emerge as a major group in its own right with the ability to take advantages of opportunities as they arose. However, the group would not seek a listing for the time being.     B and C also said that its chairman, Lord Cayzer, planned to retire in June. The company proposed that he be appointed life president and that current chief executive John Gunn should take over as chairman.     B and C shares eased 11p to 459p at 1040 GMT.  \n',ship

'Blizzard conditions halted shipping through the Bosphorus waterway and piled snow up to 70 cms deep in central Istanbul, paralysing the city for the second day running.     Snow whipped by 48 kph winds continued to fall on Istanbul and northwest Anatolia after 36 hours and weather reports predicted no relief for another two days.

'Hundreds of marines were on alert at 11 key Brazilian ports after 40,000 seamen decided to remain on indefinite strike, even after the Higher Labour Court yesterday ruled it illegal, union leaders said.     The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years, started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not return to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipowners have offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected.     \"We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off the workers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with our protest until the end,\" a union leader said.     He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marines take over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels and let the marines handle the situation by themselves.     A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order to send marines to take over the ports was given by Navy Minister Henrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of national security. But he said there were no incidents. The strike has cut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle.     Petrol station owners in four states also continued their shutdown and there were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage.  \n',ship

'About half of Brazil\'s 40,000 seamen have returned to work after accords with 22 companies, and the national strike which began on February 27 looks close to ending, a union spokesman said.

'Strikes by Brazil\'s 40,000 seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing major headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt crisis.     A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25 years and union leaders say they have seriously affected Brazilian exports by making idle 160 ships.     On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest payments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp deterioration in its trade balance.     Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most petrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country\'s industrial heartland, and in three other states closed down to press for higher fuel prices.     There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage.     The seamen\'s leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the 72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras.     The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today entitled \"Dangerous Confrontation,\" said: \"From the economic point of view the seamen\'s strike carries an alarming cost, with grave consequences for the supply situation and for the country\'s external trade.\"     The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected offers of up to 100 pct.     Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due to rule on whether the seamen\'s strike is legal. But a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, tolds that the strike would continue regardless of the tribunal\'s ruling.     Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse over the last few months of the government\'s Cruzado Plan price freeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not only workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station owners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.     Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of Curitiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for exceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions.     Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their profits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six U.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents).     Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last night as motorists filled up their tanks while they still could.     Political sources said the government of President Jose Sarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel supply situation.  \n',ship
'Brazilian bank workers voted to launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labour unrest arising from the failure of the government\'s anti-inflation plan.     At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of Sao Paulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24 unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met.     Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees\' 152 unions representing 700,000 workers, tolds the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks.     The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the state-owned petroleum company Petrobras.  \n',ship
'Brazil\'s labour unrest is spreading, with many banks, universities and government statistical offices on strike and more pay disputes looming.     Bankworkers\' leaders said that a national strike launched yesterday to press for a 100 pct immediate pay rise and monthly salary adjustments had the support of most of the 700,000 workforce.     The strike today closed the stock exchanges of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.     For the government the one positive development on the labour front was the gradual return to work of the nation\'s 40,000 seamen, who began a national strike on February 27.     A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro tolds about half the seamen had returned to work after accords with 22 companies and that the strike looked close to an end.     Otherwise the labour scene looked bleak, with the bank strike posing the most serious problems for Brazil\'s crisis-laden economy.     \"If this goes on for more than a few days it will have a serious effect because normal financial operations will grind to a halt,\" said a western diplomat in Sao Paulo.     Today Brazil\'s 50,000 university teachers in the 42 federal universities launched a national strike, with a broad political demand as well as a pay claim.     David Fleischer, head of the political science department in Brasilia university, tolds the National Association of Higher Education Teachers wanted a full congressional inquiry into what had happened to government education funds.     He said the universities were strapped for cash and that the association suspected the junior partner in the coalition government, the Liberal Front Party, PFL, of using education funds for projects which had helped their candidates in elections. The PFL holds the Education Ministry.     Hardly any sectors of the economy are proving immune to the current labour unrest, caused by the return of high inflation, officially pegged at 33 pct for January-February.     Other possible strikes looming include stoppages by oil industry workers and social security workers.  \n',ship
'About 14,000 of Brazil\'s 40,000 seamen are now back at work after pay accords with 21 shipping companies but the rest are still on strike, a spokesman at strike headquarters said today.     The seamen began a national stoppage on February 27.     The spokesman, talking by telephone from Rio de Janeiro, said 126 ships were strike-bound.     He added that because of resignations by many seamen there were scarcely any crews left on 38 of these ships.     The seamen have settled in general for pay rises of 120 pct with the 21 companies. Talks with the shipowners\' association Syndarma have been deadlocked over overtime.     While exports have been delayed by the strike, exporters say the problems have been manageable.     \"It hasn\'t been critical by any means,\" said a coffee trader in Santos, who noted that coffee was still moving on foreign ships.     Economic analysts added, however, that any delay to exports served to aggravate Brazil\'s balance of payments crisis, which last month prompted the government to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt.  \n',ship
'Canadian seafarers are almost certain to go on strike this spring in a refusal to meet rollbacks in wages and benefits asked for by their employers, Seafarers\' International Union official Roman Gralewicz said.     \"It\'s 99.9 percent--I guarantee you a strike,\" Gralewicz said in an interview.     The union represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and Canada\'s East and West coasts. Contract talks broke off in January and a conciliator has been appointed to try to help settle the dispute. The current contract expires at the end of March.

'The Chinese port of Ningbo is working well below capacity despite being only 130 miles from Shanghai, which is seriously congested, a port official said.     Jiang Feng Xiang said the port -- the deepest in China -- handled 17.95 mln tonnes of cargo last year, up from 10.44 mln in 1985, but well below its potential capacity of 32 mln tonnes. Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986.     Jiang said Ningbo is under-utilised because of its inadequate facilities, including a single track rail line linking it to Hangzhou, where it joins the national network.     Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coal from north to south China and imports include fertiliser and soda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks can handle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to 200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour.     Most of Ningbo\'s port infrastructure has been built since 1979, official publications show. A container berth and two timber and three general cargo berths will be added during the current 1986-90 five-year plan, Jiang said.     \"The rail line to Hangzhou will be double tracked by 1995. By 2000, maybe, we will overtake Shanghai,\" he added.  \n',ship
'Employers in Rotterdam port\'s strike-hit general cargo sector have been served with an injunction until May 7 preventing them from continuing with plans for 350 redundancies this year, an employers\' organisation spokesman said.     An Amsterdam court yesterday ruled there had been a legal fault in the employers\' redundancy procedure.     The employers\' spokesman said they were likely to restart the redundancy procedure afresh next week in an attempt to pre-empt the May 7 final court ruling.     Port and transport union representative Paul Rosenmuller described the court ruling as a victory for the union, but added there was still a long way to go before the dispute that has hit the general cargo sector for the past eight weeks was resolved.     Rosenmuller said there would be a meeting of the sector\'s 4,000 workers this afternoon to decide on further action in the campaign of lightning strikes that began on January 19 in protest at planned redundancies of 800, starting with 350 this year.     The employers said there were no immediate plans for meetings with the union either on the proposed redundancies or on a new work practice agreement in the sector.     Meanwhile, discussions on a new work agreement in the port\'s grain sector, due to resume next week, are stalemated, although agreement could be close in the coal and ore sector, the employers\' spokesman added.  \n',ship

Japan Line\'s cumulative debt was 68.98 billion yen at the end of September, which exceeded shareholders\' equities and reserves totalling 63.40 billion.     In December, Japan Line asked banks to shelve repayment of about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153 billion in loans to its subsidiaries.     Japan Line said then that the yen\'s steep rise and the world shipping recession had hit the company hard.     The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said today that IBJ and three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in loans to Japan Line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy seven billion yen of new Japan Line shares.     The spokesman for IBJ, Japan Line\'s largest creditor, said the package may write off part of the outstanding loans and will be worked out before long.

Both sides gave evidence to the all-party standing committee on Social Affairs today, but committee members said they saw little chance of parliamentary intervention.     The dispute began on January 19 in protest at employers\' plans for 800 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce, starting with 350 this year.

'Employers in Rotterdam\'s troubled general cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancy procedures within a week, employers\' organisation labour relations manager Gerard Zeebregts tolds.     Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said the employers\' decision would not lead to the immediate resumption of eight weeks of strikes in the sector.     The strike action was called off on Friday after an interim court injunction against the employers\' plans for 350 redundancies this year.     A court in Amsterdam ruled last week the employers had made an error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permission for the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until a final ruling on May 7.     Zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might well take up to two months, but the employers were not prepared simply to sit and wait for the May 7 court ruling with the chance they would have to start all over again in any case.     \"We cannot afford not to continue with our plans. The strikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business, and further delays would do even more damage,\" Zeebregts said.

The court ruled the employers had made a mistake in the complicated legal procedure for obtaining official permission for the redundancies, and therefore could not proceed.     \"There is no need to continue the strikes for the moment now the immediate pressure of redundancies has been lifted,\" Rosenmuller said.     But he added that the strikes, which began on January 19 in protest against plans for 800 redundancies by 1990, could resume at any time before May 7 if the employers made any moves to re-apply for permission for the redundancies.

The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.     The sources said South Korea\'s yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan\'s due to such factors.     The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.     They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.     Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.     The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month, the sources said.     A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness, they said.     Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.     This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.     The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.     The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989.     Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December, followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd\'s Register of Shipping.     However, falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry, the sources said.     Four of Japan\'s six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.     The shipbuilding companies\' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years, the sources said.     In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd MITH.T and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd JIMA.T -- account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.     \"World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world,\" said an official at a major Japanese shipping company.     The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia\'s, has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships, and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.  \n',ship
'International efforts to redirect Japan\'s export-driven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy going if the country\'s largest defence contractor and world\'s biggest shipbuilder is anything to go by.     Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd MITH.T (MHI), which began making ships and iron goods for Japan\'s military rulers 130 years ago, is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its efforts to maintain its share of export markets.     \"If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products, everyone will buy them,\" MHI president Yotaro Iida said.     Although two of MHI\'s main businesses, shipbuilding and power plant construction, have been hit hard by the yen\'s 40 pct rise against the dollar, the company has no plans to abandon them, Iida tolds in an interview.     Its other big activity, aircraft component manufacture, has performed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money Tokyo spends on defence procurement each year.     \"We have made the utmost efforts among the world\'s manufacturers to improve productivity,\" he said. \"You may be surprised if you come to see our plants. The outside is old but the inside is ultra-modern, with robots and computers.\"     Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that MHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors. The company has slashed its workforce to 47,000 from 86,000 in 1976.     Despite its cost-cutting, MHI expects profits to drop 40 pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March 31, from 1985/86\'s record 50.14 billion.     And that includes gains from the sale of MHI\'s stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp MIMT.T for 49 billion yen.     Iida is optimistic about the future, however. He said a resurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent recovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power plants in developing countries will help MHI restore its exports-to-sales ratio to the past decade\'s average of 30 pct.     MHI\'s exports-to-sales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in the half-year ended last September, from 35 to 36 pct five years ago.     China is the most promising market, although MHI also considers other non-oil-producing developing countries as major customers.     \"Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a lack of foreign currency,\" Iida said. But he added that he felt MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government financial support.     It can also finance the plants itself and recover its investment through product sales, a strategy Iida said could prove popular in the future.     In shipping, MHI is fighting back against low-priced South Korean competition by building more technologically advanced carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products difficult to transport.     Shipbuilders Association officials tolds MHI is the world\'s largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity.     Domestically, MHI is involved in 12 national projects, including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch vehicles for man-made satellites.     It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence Agency\'s F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles, although all of these have been built under licence from U.S. Firms.     MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to develop the country\'s own fighter plane to replace the currently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s.     Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure on Tokyo to buy a U.S. Plane, either the McDonnell Douglas Corp F-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16, to reduce Japan\'s huge trade surplus with the U.S.     \"It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with U.S. Makers as Japan is supported by the U.S. Defence umbrella,\" Iida said.     MHI also plans to cooperate with the U.S. In its Strategic Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in the project when it moves from the research stage, he said.     The U.S. Has been seeking Japan\'s technological support.     In fiscal 1985/86, aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of MHI\'s sales, shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct. Iida said the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct, aircraft and special vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct.     As for the remaining 30 pct, Iida said he wanted to shift the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to manufacturers and towards household goods, but he declined to specify which products.     \"By the end of this year, you may find our brand name on your daily products, although this does not mean we will run away from our mainstream business,\" he said.  \n',ship
'The volume of European exports to South Africa carried by container line vessels has declined 40 pct in the last two years, British shipping executive Antony Butterwick said.

He is chairman of the Europe South and South-East African Conference Lines and joint managing director of P and O Containers Ltd.     A statement issued by the conference here said frequency of Southern Africa/Europe container service sailings is being increased from nine to seven days.     \"This is the most positive development on the shipping front between South Africa and its main trading partners in Europe for more than four years, when the service last operated weekly,\" it said.  \n',ship
'As a British government investigation got under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship.     Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover.     Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed.     Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned to pull them out of service at present.     \"Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait and see. But it is too early to say what happened,\" he told BBC radio.     As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts had already been expressed about the design of so-called \"RoRo\" ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise.     In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads.     Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety standards.     But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design.     Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge.     \"As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability,\" he said.     Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level.     \"If you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of the ship,\" he added.  \n',ship
'U.K. Insurers could face more than 30 mln stg of insurance claims following the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, a spokesman for Lloyds of London said.     It could take weeks before the extent of the compensation claims for passengers, crew and cargo was known and also before it was known how much, if any, of the ship could be salvaged, said David Larner of Lloyds.     The hull and machinery of the Herald of Free Enterprise were valued at 25 mln stg and were insured by Townsend Thoresen\'s parent company Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc PORL.L.     The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market with Lloyds and various other companies, Larner said.     Passengers, crew and cargo were insured by the Standard Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association, one of several shipowners\' mutual insurance funds worldwide. These were also underwritten by Lloyds and other companies.     Larner said claims from passengers could be expected to total at least five mln stg, given the number of deaths and the normal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974 of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death.     Shipping sources said, however, that these claims could soar if a court found there was negligence or design faults involved.     Larner said estimates of compensation claims \"were pure guess work\" at this time. But if the ship could not be salvaged, the claims would total at least 30 mln stg.     Shares of insurances on the London stock exchange fell across the board in a generally weak market.     General Accident fell 21p to 936, Royal Insurance dropped 18p to 966 and Prudential fell 9p to 888.     P and O shares stood at a late 616, 27p lower on the day.  \n',ship
'Fading hope for passengers trapped aboard a partially-sunk Channel ferry raised fears the accident could rank among this centuries\' worst peacetime shipping tragedies.     Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo said there was no hope of rescuing any of about 220 passengers trapped in the Herald of Free Enterprise after it capsized off the Belgian coast last night.     If confirmed, the toll would make the incident the world\'s worst since a Soviet liner, the Admiral Nakhimov, collided with a freighter in the Black Sea last September and sank with the loss of nearly 400 lives. A further 856 people were rescued.     The world\'s deadliest single peacetime incident at sea was the sinking in 1912 of the Titanic with a loss of 1,500 lives.     The second biggest loss of life in peacetime was in 1914 when 1,014 people drowned when the liner Empress of Ireland collided with a freighter on the St Lawrence river in Canada.     The world\'s worst maritime disaster was in wartime that took 7,700 lives when the German liner Wilhelm Gustloff was torpedoed by a Soviet submarine in January 30, 1945.     In 1985, more than 200 were feared dead after two ferries sank near Dhaka, 174 drowned when a ferry capsized in China and 147 died when a launch sank off the Malaysian state of Sabah.  \n',ship

'Strong south-easterly winds were keeping many vessels trapped in the ice off the Finnish and Swedish coasts in one of the worst icy periods in the Baltic for many years, the Finnish Board of Navigation said.     In Finland and Sweden up to 50 vessels were reported to be stuck in the ice, and even the largest of the assisting icebreakers were having difficulties in breaking through to the stranded ships, coastguard officials said.     However, icy conditions in the southern Baltic at the Soviet oil ports of Ventspils and Klaipeda had eased, they said.

'Iran has deployed about six large missiles near the Strait of Hormuz which increase the threat to shipping in the Gulf, the New York Times said.

Styx missiles have a range of up to 50 miles.     It said the missiles had been deployed at two sites and quoted a naval analyst as saying they could be used to sink a supertanker and block the Strait of Hormuz.     Missiles now used by Iran had only a fraction of the explosive power of the Styx and could sink a supertanker only with a lucky hit, the paper said.

'Japanese shipbuilders have applied to the state\'s Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to restrict tonnage built to about half of total capacity for the year starting April 1, officials of the Shipbuilders Association of Japan said.     Under the plan, 33 yards capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) a year against capacity of about six mln CGRT.     The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 3.3 mln CGRT in the year to March 1988 and 3.1 mln the following year.     The industry has curtailed production due to oversupply nearly every year since 1977/78, under cartel or Transport Ministry guidelines. The latest guidelines call for a ceiling of four mln CGRT in the year to March 31.     The cartels, self-imposed and self-regulated, are not legally binding, but industry finds it in its own interest to stick to them.     The slowdown in orders has been caused by the strong yen and a protracted worldwide shipbuilding slump.  \n',ship
'Japan\'s ailing shipyards have won approval from the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash production to about half of total capacity for one year, effective April 1, industry sources said.     The approval follows an act of parliament passed last week designed to help the industry regroup and shed 20 pct of capacity by March 31, 1988, Transport Ministry officials said.     The cartel, comprising 33 yards capable of constructing ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes, will limit newbuilding output to a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes in 1987/88, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan said.     Industry sources said the 33 will seek to renew the cartel in 1988/89 in the belief demand will remain sluggish.     Last week\'s temporary act of parliament also allows shipbuilders to receive favourable taxation terms plus up to 50 billion yen in compensation for liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity.     Up to 30 billion yen has been allocated for purchasing redundant land and equipment from shipbuilders.     The Ministry will start drawing up its restructuring guidelines from April 1 and the yards will implement the guidelines from September, industry sources said.  \n',ship
'Kenya has signed an agreement with British and German interests to establish a shipping line that will handle 40 pct of the country\'s external trade, sources close to the deal said.     The state-owned Kenya Ports Authority, KPA, signed an agreement with the Hamburg-based shipping line Unimar Seetransport to establish the Kenya National Shipping line, with an initial capital of 100 mln shillings, sources said. KPA will hold 70 pct of the shares in the new company.     The line will initially charter vessels to operate services between Mombasa and the main ports of industrial Europe, but may eventually build or buy its own ships.

'Kuwait has asked at least four countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf, Reagan Administration officials said.     The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new \"Silkworm\" missiles at superpower flags.     The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the mouth of the gulf.     \"They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to carry their oil,\" one of the administration officials, who asked not to be identified, tolds.     The United States is considering the request to temporarily transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a move could create insurance and other problems, the officials said.     U.S. defense officials tolds yesterday that Kuwait had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S. offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping.  \n',ship
'Kuwait may re-register part of its tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the U.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian missile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were quoted by the New York Times as saying.     The transfers would allow the country of registration to escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf. Kuwait had earlier declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an admission of its need for protection, they said.     Kuwait is also looking at flagging-out to European registries, the officials said.     Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the Gulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said.     Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S. Escorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a naval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as saying.     Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran and its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian attacks.

At least two fixtures were reported on Soviet account to lift EC grain, with a 22,000 tonner booked from Tilbury for a voyage via lower Baltic Sea and redelivery passing Skaw at 4,000 dlrs daily and a 27,000 tonner from Ceuta for a voyage via the U.K. And redelivery Skaw-Cape Passero at 4,500 dlrs daily.     The Soviets also secured a 34,000 tonner from Gibraltar for a trans-Atlantic round trip at 4,500 dlrs daily and a 61,000 tonner for similar business at 6,750 dlrs daily.     Brokers said several other fixtures were also thought to be connected with Soviet grain, including a 69,000 tonner from Taranto for five to seven months at 6,500 dlrs daily. Similar fixing was reported yesterday at 6,000 dlrs.     Other timecharter fixing included a 14,000 tonner from Indonesia to the U.S. Gulf at 2,800 dlrs daily and a combined carrier of 75,000 tonnes dw from the U.S. Gulf to Italy at 9,000 dlrs daily.     Severel vessels were booked from Antwerp-Hamburg range, including a 61,000 tonner bound for Singapore-Japan at 7,500 dlrs daily and a 16,000 tonner destined for west coast India at 5,000 dlrs.     Grain fixing was much quieter out of the U.S. Gulf, with no fresh business seen on the significant routes to the Continent or Japan, although tonnage was secured for at least five small corn cargoes from the Gulf to Jamaica at between 21 and 25 dlrs. Wheat from the River Plate and Buenos Aires to Sri Lanka received 26 dlrs.     Market talk suggested 11 dlrs had been paid for grain from the U.S. North Pacific to Japan but no confirmation was available.

'Norway\'s parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.     The unilateral boycott gives domestic companies until late September to cut trade ties with South Africa and Namibia.     Although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, the boycott makes a crucial exception for ships whose final destination is decided while at sea. As oil cargoes are often resold after loading, critics said the door will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa.     Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude oil imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said.     The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure.     The boycott legislation now goes to the upper house for formal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said.  \n',ship

'Employers and the port union, FNV, are to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam\'s general cargo sector, but neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides tolds.     Little progress was made in last night\'s three hours of talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions.     \"There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV, and I can\'t say that we expect to reach any agreement. But at least we are still talking,\" a union spokesman said.     Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months.     \"The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all.\"     \"If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector, then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month,\" Schoufour said.     The series of strikes, which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector\'s 4,000 workforce starting with 350 this year.     Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw the sector\'s 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy.

'Panama Canal toll charges will not rise in the year to end-September 1988, despite last October\'s landslide which dumped 0.5 mln cubic yards of debris into the waterway, Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said.     He told a press conference that in confirming the Commission\'s earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988, he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989.     The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss in the current financial year but this could be carried over and met from next year\'s revenues.     This year\'s deficit resulted from the landslide which cost the canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This included eight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being spent on earth-moving operations to prevent any further landslides.     He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and he described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any threat to the canal\'s water supply in the foreseeable future.     Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillard cut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, adding that he expected the canal board to determine whether and when the canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest.  \n',ship

The chairman of the port employers\' organization, SVZ, Jacques Schoufour, said he was unhappy with the decision and added there was now no alternative to proceeding with redundancy plans.     The series of strikes in the sector started on January 19 in protest at employers\' plans to make 800 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year.

'The search continued for a cargo of poisonous chemical substances loaded on the Herald of Free Enterprise Ferry which capsized in Zeebrugge harbour Friday.     A total of 72 drums of various toxic materials which were loaded on trucks in the ship\'s hold have been recovered, but Belgian authorities warned it was essential to recover a further 61 containers of a cyanide-based solution.     A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at the front of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out.

Salvage work could pinpoint the exact cause of the loss of the ferry, one of three sister vessels plying cross-Channel routes from England to continental Europe.     Suspicion at present is focused on the ferry\'s main vehicle loading doors, set close to water level.

'The St. Lawrence Seaway, set to reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough year because of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the first strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officials said.     Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modes of transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal increase over last year\'s traffic levels -- and revenues -- on the 2,300 mile waterway, officials said.     In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, the seaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal, linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.     By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled through the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through the eight-lock canal.     The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrs this year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal 1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executive member of Canada\'s St Lawrence Seaway Authority.     The seaway moves about one-half of Canada\'s exported grain. Those exports of the single most important commodity carried on the waterway have been depressed by world surpluses.     The Seafarers\' International Union, which represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has said it will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers\' demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions.     \"It\'s 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike,\" Roman Gralewicz, head of the Seafarers\' Canadian branch, has said.     The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two sides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on the Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.     \"We haven\'t had a strike on the seaway for years...a prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect,\" Seaway Authority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.     \"These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the St Lawrence Seaway,\" George Miller, vice-president of the Canadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of major Canadian shipping companies, said recently.     The workers\' current contract expires May 31. The association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages for the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to restructure crew dispatching.     The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs (U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and freight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985 was its worst year in two decades.     Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on the Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to last year\'s 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls throughout the rest of the waterway.     Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway\'s 15 locks and about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.     \"We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we won\'t see a major increase for a number of years,\" Hemsley said.     A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers in Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this season but the full benefits won\'t be felt for several years, Blair said.  \n',ship
'Harbour workers said they will strike for 24 hours on Monday, effectively closing all New Zealand\'s ports.     The strike is over deadlocked wage negotiations.

'Striking seamen said they would offer their collective resignation rather than end their 13-day-old national strike on management\'s terms.     The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday night. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work under duress.     President Jose Sarney\'s government despatched troops to Brazil\'s ports and oil installations on Tuesday.     Seamen in Santos, Brazil\'s main port, are in defiant mood. One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, tolds that most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations on Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the country\'s main ports.     The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get, and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm the strike is doing to exports.     An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners Association read, \"The seamen\'s strike is illegal, irrational and unpatriotic.\"     The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the union\'s office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977 cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month.     At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with allowances.      \"Brazil\'s seamen are the second worst paid in the world, after Ghana\'s,\" dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have doubled since then with the collapse of the government\'s Cruzado Plan price freeze.     Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the dispute. The seamen are demanding pay raises of about 200 pct but have been offered less than half that.  \n',ship
'Striking Brazilian seamen, who say they have made idle 158 ships and halted Brazilian exports, today held pay talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labour Minister Almir Pazzianotto, union officials said.     Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, tolds he was optimistic the talks would lead to an end of the stoppage, which began last Friday.     Brazil\'s 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct.     The union official said the strike had halted a total of 158 vessels, including 50 in Brazil\'s main port, Santos, and about 50 more in Rio de Janeiro.     Abroad, six ships lay idle, in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa, he said.     Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern to the government, which has already had to suspend interest payments on part of Brazil\'s foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in the country\'s trade balance.     The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo Rubens Habbema, was quoted in today\'s Gazeta Mercantil newspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports.     \"Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment, and it is not conceivable that exports be hit,\" he said.     \"But even using foreign ships we must not forget that we are going to lose foreign exchange paying freight charges abroad, and all this through the fault of the seamen,\" Rubens Habbema said.     A spokesman for the port of Santos, which has been the scene of labour unrest and congestion in recent months, said movement of ships out of the port was running at about half its normal level of 12 ships a day.     He said a total of 76 ships were either waiting at anchor on moored in the harbour.  \n',ship
'Taiwan\'s shipbreaking industry is expected to decline sharply this year despite the boom in 1986 because of keener competition from South Korea and China, the rising Taiwan dollar and U.S. Import curbs on steel products, industry sources said.     Last year, Taiwanese breakers demolished a record 344 vessels totalling 3.69 million light displacement tons (ldt), up on 165 of 2.97 million ldt in 1985, Lin Chung-jung, a Taiwan Shipbreaking Industry Association (TSIA) spokesman, tolds.     China scrapped vessels of some 1.1 mln ldt last year while South Korea demolished ships of 910,000 ldt, he said.     Yao Liu, president of Chi Shun Hwa Steel Co, a leading shipbreaker and steel producer in Kaohsiung, tolds, \"We expect to scrap fewer ships this year because of an expected decline in our steel product exports.\"     Lin said many breakers predicted a 20 pct decline in scrapping operations this year due to falling demand from the U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia for Taiwanese steel.     Taiwan agreed last year to voluntarily limit its steel product exports to the U.S. To 120,000 tonnes in the first half of 1987 from about 260,000 tonnes in the first half of 1986, a Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said.     Yao said the rising Taiwan dollar means Taiwan\'s steel exports are more expensive than South Korea\'s and China\'s.     The Taiwan dollar has strengthened by some 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since September 1985 and some bankers and economists said it could appreciate to 32 to the U.S. Dollar by the end of the year from 34.23 today, Yao said.     In comparison, the won rose by about five pct and yuan remained stable during the same period, he added.     \"We have lost some orders to South Korea and mainland China because foreign importers have switched their purchases,\" he said.     Taiwan\'s steel exports to the U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia slipped to 148,000 tonnes in the first two months of 1987 from about 220,000 tonnes a year earlier, the Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said.     He said he expected further declines in later months but did not give figures.  \n',ship
'Taiwan\'s state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim its debts, chairman Louis Lo said.     He tolds in an interview that CSBC\'s first joint production venture, to build two hulls for Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd MITH.T and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd JIMA.T, he said.     Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi, which would complete production.     \"We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future,\" Lo said.     He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea.     Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs.     But he said the company, which is Taiwan\'s largest shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery.     \"We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification,\" he said.     Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87.     CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead weight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships of 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said.     Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least until 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship repairing was bright.  \n',ship
'Pay talks aimed at ending a week-old national seamen\'s strike collapsed today and the strike will continue, a union official said.     The walkout by Brazil\'s 40,000 seamen has idled 160 ships in various ports, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, tolds.     The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma).     Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today without resolving the dispute.

'Turkey pulled warships back from close escort of its Sismik 1 survey ship as the threat of conflict with Greece over oil rights in the Aegean Sea abated.     The semi-official Anatolian Agency said naval vessels ended their close protection of the ship as it continued work in Turkish waters but were following it at a distance.     Popular newspapers headlined what they saw as Turkish resolve and international pressure forcing Greece to pull back from planned exploration in disputed international waters.     \"Intense United States and NATO efforts bore fruit: Greece will stay in its national waters,\" said the daily Gunes. The top-selling Hurriyet topped its front page with: \"Our resolute stand made Greece see reason.\"     But two newspapers, Cumhuriyet and Milliyet, noted in identical headlines -- \"Crisis Frozen\" -- that the basic disagreement over exploration rights remained unsolved.

'Turkey\"s standoff with Greece over Aegean oil rights appeared at an end after the government said it had been assured Athens would not start prospecting in disputed waters.     A Foreign Ministry statement last night hinted Turkey was claiming victory. A Greek-based international consortium, North Aegean Petroleum Co., Had given up plans to start searching for oil in international waters east of Thasos island, it said.     \"In the same way it has been understood that Greece will also not undertake oil activities outside its territorial waters,\" the statement added.     An Ankara Radio report monitored in London said Foreign Minister Vahit Halefolu had called on Greece to engage in dialogue over the dispute. It was impossible to resolve the dispute by crises, he was quoted as saying.     \"We call on Greece to come and engage in a dialogue with us - let us find a solution as two neighbours and allies should,\" he said.     The radio said Halefoglu had briefed the leaders of a number of the country\"s political parties on the latest developments.     Turkey sent the survey ship Sismik 1 into the Aegean yesterday, flanked by warships, to press its case but having earlier said it would go into disputed waters, declared the vessel would stay in Turkish areas.     Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, in London on his way home after heart surgery in the United States, is expected to receive an ecstatic welcome from thousands of Turks when he returns today.     He was in defiant mood last night, telling Turkish radio: \"We can never accept that Greece should confine us to the Anatolian continent. If there are riches under the sea, they are for mankind.\"     Despite the end of the crisis, Turkish officials acknowledged that the underlying dispute over delimiting the continental shelf in the Aegean remained unsolved.     Turkey alleged that the consortium\"s plans would have infringed the 1976 Berne agreement between the two countries, which called for a moratorium on any activities until the delimitation was agreed. Greece earlier this month declared it considers the accord inoperative.  \n',ship

'The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund the increasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference.     Melvin Sims, USDA\'s general sales manager told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two departments are negotiating a \"memorandum of understanding\" on cargo preference.     Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of food aid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to gradually increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased cost of using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the Transportation Department instead of USDA. However, USDA officials said Transportation has so far contributed no money.     The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected to resolve the matter, USDA officials said.     Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA\'s Foreign Agricultural Service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid shipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult to meet.     \"As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up, its going to be harder and harder to meet,\" Kay said.     Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Glenn English (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm export programs more costly and the program should be eliminated.     In the past, farm interests opposed to cargo preference have been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests who view cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet.  \n',ship

'Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger has ordered the U.S. Navy to increase its presence near the Gulf in an effort to fulfil President Reagan\'s pledge to keep oil flowing to Europe and Japan, The New York Times reported.     The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy would keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the Arabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May, three months longer than planned.     The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to eight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the time, as happens now, the paper said.     The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sources said they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of a Chinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait of Hormuz.     It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready to continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against Iraq.     U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of those missiles, but within striking distance, the paper quoted officials as saying.     From several hundred miles at sea, carriers could launch aircraft bombing runs or missile strikes, and battleships could fire long-range missiles, the paper said.  \n',ship

'Central banks have easily beaten back the foreign exchange market\'s first test of the industrialized nations\' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said.     In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar, sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. But operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure.     \"So far G-6 has been a roaring success,\"said James O\'Neill, financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA.     \"The central banks are sending strong signals that they won\'t tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies,\" added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank.     On February 22, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K. -- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels.     The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two-year decline against major world currencies.     And initially, traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower.     But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87 marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before the G-6 accord.     The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economy picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German economy was regressing.     But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines.     Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions.     But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around 1.85 marks. \"The market was surprised that the Fed showed its face so soon,\" said Marine Midland NA\'s O\'Neill.     Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of England intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K. currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before the G-6 pact.     Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies like the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar/mark and dollar/yen.     The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving U.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March 17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent Conservative party in any general election.     \"There was a real run on sterling,\" said Anne Mills of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.     Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870 dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterday and from a peak of about 2.98 recently. \"There\'s been some heavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday\'s U.K. budget,\" said James McGroarty of Discount Corp.     As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. and British central banks, they acclerated their shift into Canadian and Australian dollars. But here too they were stymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency\'s rise.     The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollar today, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday.     And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent, sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said.     The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. cents today from a high of 69.02 Thursday.     Analysts said the central banks\' moves to stifle sudden upward movement, leave the market uncertain about its next step. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months.     The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night. Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling/short mark positions established lately.     \"Because of the change in perceptions about the health of the German economy, the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen,\" a dealer at one U.K. bank said.     Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders, lower industrial output and slowing employment gains.     Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas, for example in Australian financial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31.     Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit with Japan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollar\'s downward scope against the Japanese currency.     In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28. On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen.     \"Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in January. But the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the situation changes,\" said McGroarty of Discount.  \n',money-fx
'Gulf Arab states must coordinate economic policies more closely before moving towards their goal of a unified currency system, the President of the Arab Bankers Association said.     Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of an Arab currency traders meeting: \"We have to start with coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common system of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to go yet.\"     He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a plausible project.     The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates --  have held a series of meetings this year to examine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system which bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary System (EMS).     At present, five currencies are linked either officially or in practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar is pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies.     A common currency system or EMS-style \"grid\" would, in theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain small. \"Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their infancy,\" he said.     Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, a paucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that often does not recognise the western banking concept of interest have hampered the growth of Arab markets.  \n',money-fx

'Bahrain is introducing a new domestic money market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on the island\'s newly launched treasury bill programme.     The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all commercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in treasury bills, or through discounting them.     The circular, released officially tos, said current arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be valid except \"in quite exceptional circumstances.\"     Under the current system, the agency provides the island\'s 20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term swaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-term loans secured against government development bonds.     \"The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace these operations with short-term assistance based on Government of Bahrain treasury bills,\" the circular to banks states.     The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a higher price which will reflect an interest charge.     The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will normally be for a period of seven days.     Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of 91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since raised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme.     Bahrain\'s commercial banks are currently liquid and have been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered by the agency. But banking sources said the new regime from April 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury bills in case they need funds from the central bank.     Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold treasury bills, although the need by others to take up paper could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted yields slightly.     Last week\'s yield was six pct, although the programme had started at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct.     Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar swaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would foresake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlying treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord.  \n',money-fx
'U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the dollar.     Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday: \"We don\'t have a target for the dollar.\" He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: \"We really don\'t talk about the dollar.\"     He said protectionism was becoming \"extremely strong\" in the U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries.     \"The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It\'s extremely strong,\" he said.     \"As I\'ve said before, we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world\'s free trading system, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930s,\" he said.     While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offer any solution, he said.     \"You must address this problem on the exchange rate side, but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It\'s far more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution of it requires a comprehensive approach,\" Baker said in the interview.     Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to adjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their barriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any countries.  \n',money-fx
'Treasury Secretary James Baker said he stood by the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations to foster exchange rate stability around current levels.     \"I would refer you to the Paris agreement which was a recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals,\" Baker told The Cable News Network in an interview.     \"We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris otherwise we would not have been a party too it,\" he said.     Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to \"co-operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around those levels.\"     He refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollar rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently tended \"to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say.\"     Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend as saying he has no target for the U.S. currency, a statement that triggered this week\'s renewed decline of the dollar.     \"I think the Paris agreement represents evidence that international economic policy co-ordination is alive and well,\" Baker said.     The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was very important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade imbalances.     He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker has also \"been very outspoken\" in suggesting main trading partners grow as fast as they can.     Baker noted that the J-curve, the delayed beneficial effect of a weakening of a currency on that country\'s trade balance, takes 12 to 18 months to work its way through to the trade deficit and it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement to lower the dollar\'s value.     He also said improvements in the trade deficit should come from other sources besides the exchange rate, and pointed out the administration\'s package to improve U.S. Competitiveness was now before Congress.  \n',money-fx
'Treasury Secretary James Baker said the United States and other nations were willing to cooperate to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the levels that existed at the time of an international agreement last month.     \"Our position with respect to the dollar goes back to the Paris Agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic conditions,\" Baker told a Senate committee.     Baker continued, \"We said further that we and others are willing to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around those levels.\"     He referred to a February agreement by six leading industrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters.     Baker refused to answer a question whether Japan and Germany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economies for the United States to support the dollar.     \"I will not comment because the foreign exchange market reads more or less than is intended in my statements,\" Baker said.     Baker said that the other signatories recognized that they must carry their share of the load of correcting external imbalances that have hindered the world\'s economy.     He cited news reports that Germany would increase a proposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks to stimulate domestic growth.     Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after the Japanese budget was made final.     Baker said those nations were stimulating their economies in a manner consistent with gains against inflation.  \n',money-fx
'West German Economics Minister Martin Bangemann urged a halt to the talking down of the dollar by both official and private institutions in the U.S., Saying calm was needed on the foreign exchanges.     Speaking at the opening of the 40th Hanover Industry Fair, Bangemann said radical changes in foreign exchange parities had left their mark on exports and investments. He added that without these external difficulties, West Germany\'s economy would have grown by 3.5 pct last year instead of the 2.5 pct reported.     Bangemann said he could not deny that the economic climate in West Germany had cooled, but he stressed the country was not in a downtrend.     The minister also criticised state subsidies, which he said mainly favoured large companies and created a tax burden for smaller and medium sized firms.     Bangemann referred specifically to subsidies in the steel industry, which he said had to be fought with all legal means when they did not correspond to European Community guidelines on grants.     He added that in light of the declining demand for steel capacities had to be adjusted, saying the Bonn government would not successfully be able to stand in the way of any change in this industry.     Bangemann also spoke out against protectionism and called for more competition, citing as an example the Federal Post Office.     The Post Office enjoys a monopoly in West Germany, especially as far as deciding who is able to provide telecommunications equipment.  \n',money-fx

'The Bank of Finland said it has started dealings in banks\' certificates of deposits (CDs) with immediate effect and that it was prepared to issue its own paper to stimulate operations on the domestic money market.     Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a news conference the Bank will also limit credits on the call money market from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum credit amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling.     \"The recent introduction of three-month money and these new regulations are decreasing the role of the call money market and the discount rate as monetary instruments,\" Kullberg said.     Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying these were needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bank of Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs, they said.     \"The central bank for the first time has an instrument with which it really can influence the price of money in this country,\" one banker said.     Under the new rules banks are limited to call money credits to a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capital and cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now introduced if the limit is exceeded.     Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland\'s monetary department said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy on the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs.     \"We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue the first, just to see how the system functions.

A dealer at another bank said his bank had been asked to publicise the intervention, to send a clear signal to the markets that central banks were acting in concert to maintain the exchange rates agreed to be appropriate at last month\'s meeting of the Group of Five and Canada in Paris.     The dollar was being quoted at 6.0950/70 francs in early afternoon dealings after a fix of 6.09425 francs.     The major French bank said it sold yen at a rate of 149.28 against the dollar.

The intervention rate was cut from eight pct on March 10 after being raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 to head off speculative pressure against the franc.

Call money rose yesterday to 7-7/8 eight pct from 7-3/4 7/8 pct. Today it was first indicated at 8-1/8 1/4 before easing on news of the tender to 7-13/16 7/8 pct.

'Today\'s liberalised financial markets are making it extremely difficult for Japan\'s monetary authorities to prevent the yen\'s rise against the dollar, but they have several options other than normal intervention, Bank of Japan sources said.     A senior central bank official said that such methods as controlling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks, which have not been invoked since 1978, are all being considered.     \"But the time may not be ripe,\" he said.     \"In this era of financial liberalisation, it\'s almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,\" said another senior bank official.     But the first official said: \"From a technical viewpoint, the Bank of Japan could activate swap agreements immediately after other central banks involved agreed to do so.\"     A swap agreement, an exchange of currency between two nations, allows both sides to acquire a ready source of the other\'s currency in case of need.     \"If the Bank invokes such swaps, both parties would announce the decision jointly,\" said the first official.     The sources said they believed the limit of currency market intervention may be being reached after they saw recent concerted market action by central banks of major industrial nations was increasingly ineffective in propping up the battered dollar.     But intervention is at least an option, they said. Further easing of monetary policy will be very difficult with an official discount rate already at a record low of 2.5 pct, they said.     Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita has repeatedly ruled out another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation.     One bank official said he could not deny the possibilty of the Bank of Japan activating currency swap agreements with the U.S. And other central banks, if these banks continue intervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and run out of their yen cash positions.     \"But we don\'t think they have become short of yen quite yet,\" he said.     The bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit with the U.S. Federal Reserve and another 2.5 billion mark and 200 billion yen limit with the West German and Swiss central banks, according to the sources.     Foreign exchange dealers estimate the Fed had sold two billion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support the dollar in New York last week.     The central bank sources also said Japan may arrange other currency swap agreements with Britain and France if they find it necessary, but added they are not actually talking with each other towards that end.  \n',money-fx
'The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range, a senior central bank official told reporters.     He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar rise.     Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks, he said.     The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but declined to be more specific.     Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy.     Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S. Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.     The senior bank official said he expects Japan\'s gross national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little changed from the performance expected this year.     Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of nearly one percentage point, he said.     He said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy. The economy\'s performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added.     The central bank\'s monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said. The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half.     Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said. \"We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may still be wet,\" he added.     Liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially, he said.     The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may continue, he said.  \n',money-fx
'The Bank of Japan stepped up its dollar buying as it re-entered the market after the midday Tokyo lunch break, dealers said.     They said the bank seemed more determined to support the dollar than it did this morning.     Several dealers said the central bank intervened this afternoon when the dollar stood around 149 yen.     One said it purchased 150 to 200 mln dlrs in the half-hour since the market re-opened after its lunchtime closure. Another said the bank still has buying orders in the market.  \n',money-fx
'The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 1,300 billion yen, money traders said.     Of the total, 400 billion yen will yield 3.8502 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a 41-day repurchase accord maturing on May 19.     Another 400 billion yen will yield 3.7991 pct in a 20-day repurchase pact maturing on April 28, they said.     The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8125 pct one-month, and 3.7500 pct three-week commercial bill discount rates today.     Tomorrow\'s surplus is attributable to government tax allocations to local governments and public entities.     The operation will put outstanding bill supply at about 4,300 billion yen, they said.  \n',money-fx
'The Bank of Spain suspended its daily money market assistance obliging borrowers to take funds from the second window, where on Wednesday rates were raised to 16 pct compared with 14 pct for normal overnight funds.     Money market sources said in view of high borrower demand the suspension was likely to remain in effect until April 3, the start of the next 10-day accounting period for reserve requirements. The suspension comes after the Bank yesterday gave 1,145 billion pesetas assistance, a record high for this year.     It said 90 billion pesetas was provided at the second window.  \n',money-fx
'The Bank of Spain suspended its daily money market assistance and offered to drain funds with three- and seven-day repurchase agreements at 12-1/2 pct, money market sources said.     The sources said the measures were a further attempt to rein in money supply and were likely to force some institutions to scramble for funds before the 10-day accounting period for reserve requirements closes on Monday.     The bank, which raised its rate for ordinary overnight assistance to 13-3/4 from 13-1/2 pct on Wednesday, opened its special borrowing facility for overnight funds at 14-1/2 pct.     Money market sources said institutions in need of funds were likely to have to return to the bank tomorrow for further assistance.     The bank rarely invites applications for ordinary assistance on a Saturday and the sources said it was more likely to open its special borrowing facility again.  \n',money-fx
'The Bank of Zambia has paid out foreign exchange arrears from three auctions conducted last year, a bank spokesman said.     \"We have now cleared three auctions and are left with only four, worth eight mln dlrs,\" the spokesman said without specifying the amount paid out.     The bank had not paid foreign exchange to private firms since it suspended the weekly auctions on January 28.     It has said the auctions were suspended because it planned to introduce a modified system after talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.     President Kenneth Kaunda announced last month that the auction would be retained for allocating foreign exchange to approved private sector bidders, but would not be used to determine the kwacha\'s exchange rate.     Last week, he said the auction had run into trouble because of a shortage of foreign exchange.     The government has fixed the exchange rate at nine kwacha per dollar, effectively revaluing the kwacha by 67.7 pct.  \n',money-fx
'Taiwan imposed currency controls today in what bankers called a desperate move to prevent speculation as the Taiwan dollar appreciated against the U.S. currency.     The strict controls will require proof that large remittances to Taiwan are connected to commercial transactions rather than currency speculation.     Bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying they were a panic reaction to pressure from Washington for faster appreciation of the Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar, which would slow exports to the United States.     Remittances exceeding one mln dlrs earned through exports, shipping, insurance or bank lending will now need government approval, along with remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source.  \n',money-fx
'The Belgian National Bank bought foreign currencies against francs on the open market in the week ended March 9, a Bank spokesman said.

They slipped 394 mln francs to 37.33 billion, mostly due to sales of dollars for Special Drawing Rights, the spokesman said.  \n',money-fx
'West Germany takes \"very seriously\" the recent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote exchange rate stability around current levels, Finance Ministry State Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said.     Talking to journalists before a meeting of European Community Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements for stabilising currencies.     But he noted the official communique said the participants agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. \"We\'re taking this sentence very seriously,\" he said.     Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against the mark since the meeting.     He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris agreement should help in this respect.     Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and had not ruled out \"appropriate and timely\" action if necessary.     Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the economic situation in the 12-nation bloc.     The Commission has sharply revised down expected German gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC country to stimulate economic activity.     Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany\'s economy slowed in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in view that would make quick remedial action necessary.     He said a number of favourable indicators such as high level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a recovery could be expected, while exports would pick up slightly during the course of the year.  \n',money-fx
'French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur discussed the need to control public spending in talks here today with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, a Treasury spokesman said.     The spokesman said the ministers reviewed their economies, and public spending, domestic and European Community-wide.     He declined to comment on whether the subject of concerted action to shore up the dollar had arisen. The U.S. Currency dipped sharply earlier this week after a month of relative stability after an agreement by six major industrialised nations in Paris on February 22 to stabilise their currencies. \n',money-fx
'The Bundesbank came into the domestic money market to add temporary liquidity through federal government funds as call money rates rose above 4.0 pct, dealers said.     They estimated that the bulk of liquidity was added at about 3.95 pct. Call money fell to 3.90/4.0 pct after the move. It had been 3.80/90 on Friday.     The move came as call money extended a rise begun Friday after the Bundesbank took up some six billion marks owed to it by other European central banks after currency interventions in the framework of European Monetary System in January.     Rates could ease further in trading today but dealers expect them to rise later in the week as banks begin paying out funds for tax payments on behalf of clients.     Some 30 billion marks is likely to leave the market this month, with the bulk being paid out next week.     In anticipation of this liquidity drain, banks have stocked up reserves at the Bundesbank.     On Thursday, minimum reserve holdings declined to 57.0 billion marks from 60.0 billion on Wednesday but were well above the 53.2 billion held on Tuesday. Daily average reserve holdings rose slightly to 54.7 billion marks from 54.5 billion.     The daily average reserve holdings were above the level of around 51 billion marks dealers said is needed for the required daily average for the month.     With the heavy tax drain in March, banks are likely to remain cautious about taking more liquidity out of reserves than is absolutely necessary.     However, a new securities repurchase pact likely to be added next week to replace a facility expiring then could somewhat offset the drain.     The Bundesbank is expected to allocate more than the 3.4 billion marks which is due to be rolled over, dealers said.  \n',money-fx
'The Bundesbank entered the open market in the late morning to buy dollars against yen in concert with the Bank of France, dealers said.     The Bundesbank came into the market when the dollar was around 148.10 yen just after it had fallen below 148 to touch 147.80 at 1027 GMT. The move had little effect, with the dollar still testing 148 yen ahead of the official fixing.     Dealers said the intervention was for fairly small amounts, in contrast to the Bundesbank\'s activity on Wednesday when dealers reported it bought about 100 mln dlrs.     The Bundesbank had no comment.  \n',money-fx
'The Bundesbank bought large amounts of dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollar above 149 yen, dealers said.     The dollar intervention was in concert with some other central banks, they said.     Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of England supported the dollar against the yen earlier today and that these two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also active yesterday.     The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers\' remarks.     Dealers said the intervention underlined the determination of central banks to keep currencies within recent ranges following last month\'s agreement in Paris by six leading countries to foster currency stability.     One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with the Bundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buy dollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves.     He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing the situation to see if it should intervene in consultation with other central banks.     Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar had until yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range, and above 150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to test central banks\' resolve to defend currency stability.     But the test came this week with the dollar falling below 1.81 marks and 150 yen. Dealers said a reviving trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that the dollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S. Trade deficit were behind the weakness.     This week\'s intervention showed central banks were prepared to cooperate to defend the Paris pact, dealers said.     Dealers said it was significant the West German and British central banks were supporting the dollar against the yen.     That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation by central banks to foster currency stability, they said.     But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arranged and how frequent consultations between central banks were.  \n',money-fx
'The Bundesbank declined to comment on rumours in Tokyo that it was intervening heavily to support the dollar, but dealers here said they had not seen the German central bank in the market all morning.     The dollar was quoted at around 1.8040 marks shortly after midday in nervous but quiet trading, up from its 1.7975/85 opening.     Spreads against the mark remained around 10 basis points, with some banks quoting only five point spreads. Dealers said spreads would widen and the dollar would move more sharply if the Bundesbank did intervene.  \n',money-fx

'The Bundesbank is likely to steer a steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in credit policies is not expected at tomorrow\'s regular central bank council meeting, bank economists and dealers said.     \"There is no need for action,\" Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of Berliner Handels- and Frankfurter Bank (BHF) said.     Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last month\'s Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target zone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out.     One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed.     Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact.     But such demands could re-emerge if West Germany failed to stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade deficit.     Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also precluded a further cut in official interest rates.     Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January.     Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates. But Poehl played down the risk of inflation.     Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained stable last month was a success. Some said it was likely to return to within the target range later this year.     \"The special factors which boosted money supply growth last year are disappearing,\" one economist said.     He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986 was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds.     This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic credit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock growth was expected to narrow in the medium-term.     These developments were increasing the Bundesbank\'s scope for a rate cut in the medium-term, economists said.     Money market dealers said period rates remained little changed, indicating no change in credit policy was expected.     Call money rates declined to 3.75/80 pct from 3.90/95 yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity.     Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on behalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect of this month\'s major tax payment period is felt. Payments for the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market.     The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities repurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in rates on Monday by injecting funds through government-owned banks.     Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80.     One dealer said, \"If the central bank wanted lower interest rates, it would first of all drive call money rates down.\"     Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve assets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on Monday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of March. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected.  \n',money-fx
'The Bundesbank set a new tender for a 28-day securities repurchase agreement, offering banks liquidity aid at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said.

'One or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, money dealers said.     As a result, call money soared in active trading to around the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds.     Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily 51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first 29 days of the month.     Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7 billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion.     To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the Bundesbank\'s offer for sale of Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.     Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday, flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.     Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name, commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so.     With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills, draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.     One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced knowledge of the market\'s needs, should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on Friday.     Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.     \"(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we\'re not selling them in this amount,\" he said. \"If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.\"     But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates, given the delicate state of currency markets.     International central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark. Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar.     \"The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular,\" the senior dealer said.     Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism.     Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between Germany\'s major employers and the unions, the Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said.     Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.  \n',money-fx
'Finance Minister Michael Wilson said large inflows of capital into Canada, principally into the country\'s bond market, is a major reason behind the sharp recovery in the Canadian dollar.     He said the inflow of funds, mainly from Japan, Europe and the United States, is the result of \"confidence in the direction this country is going in.\"     \"That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today is higher than 75 cts (U.S.) compared to this time last year (when it was) a little over 69 cts,\" Wilson told the House of Commons daily question period.     Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a record 23.1 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986, more than double the previous year, with Japan investing a record 9.5 billion dlrs in the market.     Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about a possible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investment abroad. Canadian investment, including the buying of foreign companies, stocks and bonds, rose to 12.53 billion dlrs from 6.19 billion dlrs in 1985.     The minister said the flow of funds from abroad would generate many new jobs in Canada.  \n',money-fx
'Central bankers said they were generally satisfied with the response to the Paris accord two weeks ago to stabilize currencies at around current levels.

One top official said the rate cuts would help to stimulate growth generally in Europe and welcomed that countries other than West Germany were seen to be helping sustain the economy.      The central bankers, who spoke on the condition they not be named, said the meeting of governors from the Group of 10 countries also heard a report from Michel Camdessus, the new managing director of the International Monetary Fund, on the IMF\'s latest assessment of the debt crisis.

'The Bank of Japan intervened to stem strong yen rises against the dollar during London trading this morning, dealers said.     The Bank of Japan here declined comment.     The Bank of England was also rumored to be buying dollars against the yen this morning but it also declined comment.     Dealers said the intervention halted a sudden late morning drop to a low of 148.65 yen, holding the dollar steady until midsession at about 148.80.     The Bank of England was strongly rumored to have intervened on behalf of the dollar against the yen yesterday, but it gave no confirmation.     Overnight reports from Tokyo said that the Bank of Japan was aggressively supporting the dollar, but failed to push it back to the perceived target level of 150 yen.     Selling during the London trading morning was largely attributed to Japanese institutions.     Dealers here were loath to quantify the scale of Bank of Japan action this morning. One U.S. Bank trader said it could have been up to 500 mln dlrs, but said this was largely a guess.  \n',money-fx
'Foreign currency futures markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band, said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\'s, CME, executive committee.     \"The target zone would not affect our market I think at all.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy market,\" Melamed tolds in an interview.     \"We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a four pct shift,\" he said, referring to permitted currency fluctuations in the early 1970s. \"One thing you can adjust is to make each contract a larger value.\"     As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental in the development of currency futures, which now are crucial to the Chicago exchange.     Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can approach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by governments to control currency fluctuations.     \"They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an hour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it\'s unrealistic and it doesn\'t work and it\'s unnecessary.\"     The CME\'s top policymaker also said a decision by the exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity markets on so-called \"triple-witching\" day.     \"We think that the settlement in the morning will have a salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think this issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change in the structure as of next June,\" when the move is scheduled to go into effect, he said.     Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders of the popular Standard and Poor\'s 500 stock index future would address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading.     Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own account. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups.     The changes \"will in time have an extremely positive effect on the marketplace. That\'s going to prove very, very instrumental in increasing volume over time,\" he said, predicting the increase would come within a year.     Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, said the CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit on the S and P 500 index\'s daily price movement when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could not be a temporary program.     The CME also received \"many negative comments, many more than we anticipated,\" Melamed conceded. Many futures commission merchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the event the price approached the bottom limit.  \n',money-fx

'Chinese Vice-Premier Tian Jiyun said plans to scrap the country\'s parallel currency, Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs), had been postponed due to objections from foreign businessmen and others.     But Tian told a news conference the Chinese government still considered FECs unsatisfactory.     Asked about the current state of plans to abolish the FECs, Tian said: \"We have decided to postpone the question. As to whether it will be done in the future, it will be done according to the evolution of the situation.\"     He said many people, including foreign businessmen, had raised objections to the plan to abolish the certificates, and added: \"It is rather complicated.\"     The FECs were introduced in 1980 for use by foreigners in China. But they now circulate widely among local residents and there is a big black market in the currency, though it is theoretically at par with the ordinary Chinese currency, renminbi.     Tian said the government still considered that the FECs had \"many demerits and negative influences.\"     Bank of China President Wang Deyan tolds earlier this month that he thought it unlikely that the certificates would be scrapped this year.     Western diplomats and economists have said the Chinese authorities are having trouble finding a suitable alternative.

He described the dollar\'s sharp fall against the yen at the start of the week as a \"passing incident\" and added, \"Everyone is resolved to support the Paris accord.\"     Questioned about his plan to help the world\'s poorest countries, Chirac said he did not envisage any large-scale debt write-offs.     \"I don\'t think we can talk of write-offs - even the poorest countries have not asked for that,\" he said.     Chirac said he wanted commercial banks to give third world countries better terms in rescheduling their debts, and for the International Monetary Fund to soften its conditions.     \"One cannot pity the banks - they bear a lot of responsibility due to the encouragement they gave to these countries to take on debts. Now the banks are complaining but I do not weep for them.\"  \n',money-fx

'An exchange loss of 7.6 billion ringgit in 1986 pushed Malaysia\'s outstanding external debt up to 50.99 billion ringgit, from 1985\'s 42.3 billion, the Central Bank said in its annual report.     Bank Negara said although Malaysia\'s net borrowing dropped in 1986, its external debt rose due to the 30 pct appreciation of the basket of currencies against which the ringgit is pegged.     The basket comprises principally the U.S. Dollar, yen, mark, Swiss franc, French franc, sterling, guilder, Canadian and Singapore dollars, it added.     Bank Negara said growth in external debt, which declined progressively from a peak of 58 pct in 1982 to 13.6 pct in 1985, rose by 20.2 pct in 1986.     Malaysia\'s debt serving ratio of 17.6 pct of its exports in 1986 is within the prudency limit of 20 pct, Bank Negara Governor Jaafar Hussein told reporters.  \n',money-fx
'The surge in currency futures since Friday on the heels of the Reagan administration\'s proposed tariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the coming week, financial analysts said.     \"The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect it to last a little longer,\" said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst with Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co.     Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of some momentum today, is likely to continue, he said.     Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the advance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said, even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention.     Treasury Secretary James Baker\'s comments that the G-6 nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with his refusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a note of stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said.     Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner said G-6 central banks haven\'t yet shown the full force of their commitment to the Paris accord.     \"I\'m among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the scenes,\" Horner said.     Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures.     \"Coordinated, punishing intervention\" by the central banks -- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has only smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to Horner.     \"I think we\'re near the top of the range in the Europeans (currencies),\" he said.      On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, which set a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract, is at 0.007050, Horner said.     Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet to peak.     \"The basic trend in the currencies is higher,\" said Anne Parker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"The market wants to take the dollar lower.\"     Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a G-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price activity the remainder of the week, Mills said.     In addition, although the market shrugged off relatively healthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators and factory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger role in coming sessions, the analysts said.     Friday\'s employment statistics in particular will be closely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of 250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar.  \n',money-fx
'News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7 finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key to the direction of currency futures at the International Monetary Market, but any such agreement will need to go beyond the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures, financial analysts said.     \"If they (the finance ministers) give the market something really new to look at -- that is, some package that goes beyond the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the dollar,\" said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills.     On the other hand, \"anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar,\" Mills said.     Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar, nor will central bank intervention.     \"A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies and sell the dollar,\" said one trader for a large retail firm on the floor of the IMM.     \"If there is no concrete resolution, they will be looking to sell the dollar, possibly down to the 1.80 mark level,\" he said.     Technically, most currency futures are poised for another rise, said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane.     Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever, while June sterling set a new contract high on Monday.     \"Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you don\'t need much to get things rolling,\" Sloane said.     In particular, the June Canadian dollar, for which Sloane recently put out a buy recommendation, has hovered in a range between 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks, forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside.     A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal a breakout, Sloane said, and would likely mean the nearby Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the 0.7800 level. June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday.     Mills noted, however, that interest rate differentials between Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narrowed dramatically recently, with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds only about 80 basis points above U.S. 10-year notes.     What has helped the Canadian currency, she noted, is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the Canadian equity market, particularly from Japanese investors.     Other analysts, however, said currency futures may be near the top of their long-term rally.     \"Something will be done at the (G-5 and G-7) meeting to calm people,\" said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics.     The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European currencies will trade, Horner said.     But sterling futures may still make another run for new highs, up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract, on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections and possibly another interest rate cut, Horner said. The June British pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday.     Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings.     The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152 yen, Horner said. In yen futures, the bottom of the dollar\'s range would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the June contract. June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday.     If such a range does emerge from the meetings, \"we will have one more rally in the yen,\" Horner said.  \n',money-fx

The dollar subsequently hovered at 147.55/65 yen.     Dealers said they were uncertain about the size of the intervention, but some said it was only for a small amount. They were also uncertain whether the Fed intervened on its own account, or if it executed orders for the Bank of Japan.  \n',money-fx

'The sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test of last month\'s Group of Five (G-5) plus Canada agreement to stabilise currencies, dealers and bank economists said.     \"The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated central bank intervention,\" one dealer for a German bank said, echoing widepread sentiment in the market.     But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged in Paris still exists. Some dealers said there were growing signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further.     Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention, the dollar plunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today. It was quoted as low as 148.40 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they expected the U.S. Currency to decline further.     \"The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen range,\" Chase Bank AG\'s senior dealer Eckhart Hager said.     Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp dollar drop. \"Window-dressing\" operations by some Japanese companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining the U.S. Currency.     Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not technical. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\'s comment the Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a renewed attempt by the U.S. Administration to talk the dollar down.     \"Suddenly, support levels which had existed for fear of central bank intervention disappeared,\" one dealer said.     The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1.5 billion dlrs, and this with comments by Japanese officials indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge, dealers said. Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank intervention if necessary.     Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last month to stabilise currencies - Japan, Britain, Canada, France, the U.S. And West Germany - to take action in line with the pact.     But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were not detected in the open market during the European morning. Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act.     While some said the West German central bank would support the dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks, others said the Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marks or if the decline accelerated.     The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27, when the dollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks.     \"The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment,\" one dealer said. Others said cooperation between central banks and governments was easier said than done.     Some said Baker\'s remarks and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter\'s warning that the U.S. And Japan were on the verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift.     \"It\'s hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands,\" a dealer said. Another added, \"If the Americans do not get what they want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6.\"     Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter.     \"It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the necessary U.S. Fiscal contraction,\" Citibank said.     It added, \"Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marks is not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marks or even less is expected this year.\"     And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987 economic report, \"We are looking for a further, more gradual, fall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year.\"     But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in force was not universal. Some dealers said not too much should be read into Baker\'s and Yeutter\'s comments.     \"There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken down,\" a senior dealer said.  \n',money-fx
'Central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar\'s losses today, but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currency is headed for a further retreat.     Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceive that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies.     Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway over the currency market than central bank intervention and these argue for a further dollar decline, dealers said.     \"The market can be bigger than the central banks. And economic fundamentals will always come to the fore,\" said a dealer at one major U.S. bank.     As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the markets on behalf of the U.S. currency.     Reports of the authorities\' actions helped the dollar recover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from the post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it still failed to regain Monday\'s U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen.     Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5 billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars yesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve.     Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that the Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen today. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased a small amount of dollars for yen.     The Fed\'s last confirmed intervention was on January 28 when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of Japan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks.     The authorities\' actions appeared to back up the February 22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels.     But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by the authorities\' intervention which they said can only soften extreme moves in the market.     For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed\'s purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than for the U.S. central bank\'s own account, suggesting a rather   watered-down American commitment to the currency accord.     The Bank of England\'s action also was thought to be completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcing the market\'s view that Japan is the most resolute of the six nations in its support of the currency pact.     \"No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the other two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than anything else,\" said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp.     \"I\'m not convinced the intervention was concerted,\" said Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.  \"It\'s a yen problem more than anything else.\"     Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist sentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the American authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen.     \"The dollar\'s break below the key 150 yen level ties the Treasury\'s hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene on its own account because of the strength of protectionism here,\" said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp.     Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets are becoming increasingly politicized. Despite official denials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance a lower dollar to help trim the nation\'s trade deficit.     The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade deficit in 1986 was with Japan.     Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker\'s comment on Sunday that the February currency pact had not established dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the U.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat.     \"The dollar still has more room on the downside against the yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. The currency market is becoming very political,\" said Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank Ltd.     Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end of April or early May.     Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their economies, it may not be enough to solve structural economic imbalances in the near future, dealers said.     \"Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, it won\'t be enough to help the trade situation much,\" said Bourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to 148 yen in the next couple of days.  \n',money-fx
'Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish, and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord, foreign exchange analysts polled bys said here.     \"The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,\" a senior dealer at one leading bank said.     The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability.     Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term, but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit.     Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar.     Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus.     But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, the dealers said.     If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on the dollar, they said.     The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord, they added.     \"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil\'s unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scandal,\" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank.     \"There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140.00 yen by the end of this year,\" said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi.     But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention.     Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S. Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1.87 marks.     The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said.     But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar\'s decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars.     However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said \"The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March.\"     Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities.     U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said.  \n',money-fx
'The dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month\'s Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates, senior foreign exchange dealers said.     Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down. Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month\'s accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down, the dealers said.     \"The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,\" said Koji Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd\'s treasury division.     He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency.     \"This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention,\" Kidokoro said.     Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency.     They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5 billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers, and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U.S. Central bank in New York.     Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen.     \"If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the Americans don\'t want,\" said Haruya Uehara, chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.     He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.     But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.     \"The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan\'s inertia in stimulating its economy,\" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd\'s international treasury division.     In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax.     In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, Dai-Ichi Kangyo\'s Tanaka said.     Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar.  \n',money-fx

The Treasury\'s account with the bank dropped 1.3 billion guilders. Dealers said a larger amount of funds in the form of interest and repayments on state loans went out than came in the form of tax payments to the state.     Notes in circulation rose 360 mln to 27.7 billion as the public withdrew cash to celebrate this week\'s Carnival festival or take an end-of-winter holiday break, dealers said.

The cause for the rise was a rather tight 4.8 billion guilders of special advances set by the Bank yesterday compared with 8.0 billion guilders for the previous set, dealers added.

'Loans and advances from the Dutch Central Bank to the commercial banks fell 1.01 billion guilders to 9.5 billion guilders in the week ending March 30, the Bank\'s weekly return showed.     Dealers said payments by the Dutch state, partly in the form of civil service wages, had outweighed payments to the State, causing the money market deficit to ease.     The Treasury\'s account with the Bank dropped 960 mln guilders to 6.5 billion guilders.     Liabilities in gold or foreign currency rose 200 mln to 11.9 billion guilders.     Dealers said it was more likely that the alteration in this item on the weekly return indicated normal commercial foreign exchange business rather than intervention by the Central Bank.

These rises were balanced by a 1.6 billion guilders rise in the Treasury\'s account at the Bank, made up mainly of repayments on housing loans by local authorities.

The Bank\'s gold and currency reserves rose by 484 mln to 56.89 billion guilders, while the value of non-gold holdings rose by 140 mln guilders, analysts said.     They added that the rise in the reserves was merely the result of commercial currency transactions by the Bank.     Call money and period tariffs were only fractionally changed this week and were seen sustaining their stable levels since no dramatic changes in the money market debt, currently around 10.25 billion guilders, are expected.

'European Community (EC) finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System (EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said.     \"There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System, with all that implies,\" Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort.     The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January.     The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system.     But Eyskens said February\'s agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS.     He told a news conference yesterday\'s meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries.     They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins.     But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC\'s Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors.     He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates.     The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC\'s long term goal of economic and monetary integration.     \"We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system,\" Eyskens said.     Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC\'s plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead.     EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties.     Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to \"dedramatise\" realignments of EMS parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers.     However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea.     British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves.     He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other\'s currencies -- an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves.     He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory.    The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul.  \n',money-fx
'European Community finance ministers and central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discuss strengthening Europe\'s joint currency float amid continuing worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges.     Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host the informal talks, tolds the ministers and central bank chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the light of the February agreement among leading industrialised countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels.     In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord between the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada had proved itself \"more or less workable.\"     But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been growing since fears of a trade war between the United States and Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a record low against the surging yen early this week.     The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being held to coordinate the EC\'s positions on monetary issues and Third World debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week.     The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow.     Continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint float holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda.     Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable dollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings.     The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months.     In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the EC\'s Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank Governors.     The committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January.     Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, the fledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take over the mark\'s dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has met with a cool response in West Germany.     He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise capital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, such as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls.     Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in the Community.      He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member states were willing to push further towards the EC\'s goal of monetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included management of exchange rates by some kind of common institution, instead of by national central banks as at present.     Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen by the EMS\'s founding fathers, have been thwarted by the reluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove up their sovereignty in the monetary field.     EMS development has also been held up by Britain\'s refusal so far to join the system\'s core exchange rate mechanism.  \n',money-fx
'Recent slackness on Dutch capital markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank\'s policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.     While agreeing with the Bank\'s commitment to defend the guilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use of the range within which the guilder and the mark can fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System (EMS).     Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV (Amro) said the Central Bank\'s policy was overcautious.     \"I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the range given to the guilder in the EMS,\" Nelissen said at the presentation of Amro\'s 1986 annual report last week.     Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.     The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate policies to influence the exchange rate.     The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands.     Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.     Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: \"By maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to obtain.\"     Amro\'s Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he added.     Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central Bank\'s policy, director-general Julien Geertsema tolds, noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency.     \"It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate,\" he added.     Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows between the two countries, as the economic performance of the two does not differ much, economists said.     Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month.     Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest and exchange rates.     West Germany is the Netherlands\' largest single trading partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of Statistics figures show.     At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a rate of around 5-7/16 pct.     Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in 1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany.     In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month. German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts.     But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank.     Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22, the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5 pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.     The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.     While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range narrow.     \"The European Monetary System is not only a relationship between the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell large amounts of a third currency,\" Central Bank vice-director Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said.     \"If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the markets would start to believe it was weak. We don\'t want that. We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the mark,\" he said.  \n',money-fx
'The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.     Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.     And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe\'s common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world\'s first Ecu coin.     But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system\'s founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d\'Estaing.     Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund.     But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one economist who has closely watched the system\'s development.     The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system\'s greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.     Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system.     Another frustration has been Britain\'s failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system.     No change in the British government\'s attitude is expected before the country\'s next general elections, due by mid-1988.     Meanwhile, the system\'s last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC\'s highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.     Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.     But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change.     \"Technical measures won\'t be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank\'s economic research department.     Economists say the system\'s fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they predict.  \n',money-fx

'Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris.     Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect fundamentals.     Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to bring about currency stability in line with the Paris agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was likely.     But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency levels would be considered in line with underlying economic fundamentals.     In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies around their then current levels.     Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments surrounding trade tensions.     U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.     The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said. He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp rise of the yen.     The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates in line with the Paris accord, he added.  \n',money-fx

'The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul Volcker, has written to the chairman of the House Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration Wednesday.     Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firms abroad.     He added, \"even Japan, against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed,\" has started opening its markets.     In his letter, made available at the Treasury, Volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks, was a problem.     \"I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt,\" Volcker said.     It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said.     Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker \"about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility.\"     He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates \"is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects.\"     \"For example, the bill\'s directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations,\" Volcker said.

'Robert Heller, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, said commodity prices could form a useful guide for setting domestic and international monetary policy.     Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Heller said, \"A broadly based commodity price index may be worth exploring\" as a guide to monetary policy.     \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, monetary policy might be eased,\" he said.     Commodities are also standardized to avoid measurement problems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give \"early warning\" signs of wholesale and retail changes.     \"There is no need to react to every small fluctuation in commodity prices or to do so on a daily basis,\" Heller said in a prepared text.     \"But if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend, a policy action might be considered,\" he said.     Heller said using a broad-based commodity price index as an indicator for monetary policy would also contribute to stabilized currency exchange rates.     Commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and prices for them are more consistent than for other types of goods, he said.

Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.

They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving scope for a small fall in rates.     M-3 money supply, the government\'s key aggregate, finished 1986 within the government\'s three to five pct growth target, rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.  \n',money-fx
'Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said a further yen rise would have adverse effects on the Japanese economy.     He told Japanese business leaders the Bank of Japan will continue to take adequate measures, including market intervention, to stabilize exchange rates if necessary, in close cooperation with other major industrialized nations. He said the current instability of exchange rates will not last.     Six major nations - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - agreed in Paris last month to act together to hold currencies stable.     Sumita said the Bank of Japan will continue to pursue adequate and flexible monetary policies while watching economic and financial developments in and outside Japan.     He said the decision to cut the discount rate on February 20 was a hard choice for the Bank because monetary conditions had already been sufficiently eased.     To prevent a resurgence of inflation, the Bank will take a very cautious stance regarding developments stemming from easy credit conditions, he said.     He said the latest discount rate cut to 2.5 pct should stabilize exchange rates and expand domestic demand.     Commenting on the dollar\'s fall below 150 yen, Sumita reiterated he cannot find any specific reason for the currency\'s weakness.     The market undertook speculative dollar selling by reacting to overseas comments by monetary authorities and trade tension, he said.     Sumita repeated that the Japanese economy may gradually recover in the latter half of the 1987/88 fiscal year ending April 1, 1988, provided exchange rates stabilize.  \n',money-fx
'Deputy Finance Ministers from the Group of 10 leading western industrialised countries met here to discuss the world debt crisis, trade imbalances and currency stability today following last month\'s Paris monetary accord, sources close to the talks said.     The officials met at the offices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to discuss broad aspects of world monetary policy in preparation for the IMF\'s interim committee meeting in Washington in April.     The talks were the first high-level international review of the monetary situation since the accord last month reached by the U.S., West Germany, France, Britain, Japan and Canada to stabilise world currency markets at around present levels following the 40 pct slide in the dollar since mid-1985.     Other countries represented at today\'s talks were Italy, which refused to attend last month\'s meeting on the grounds that it was being excluded from the real discussions, the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland.     Many of the officials had met earlier today and yesterday within the framework of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to review the slow progress being made in cutting the record 170 billion dlr U.S. Trade deficit and persuading West Germany and Japan to open their economies to more foreign imports.  \n',money-fx
'Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen.     He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the six nations have taken measures, including market intervention, to support the dollar above that level.     Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen.     Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize exchange rates.     Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of each nation since the February 22 Paris accord, he said he did not think the fundamentals themselves had changed substantially.     But he said the market is sensitively looking at what is happening in major nations. He did not elaborate.     Miyazawa added that it was difficult to say why there has been such speculative dollar selling in the market.  \n',money-fx
'German banking authorities are weighing rules for banks\' off-balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments, banking sources said.     Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. To Japan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank\'s division of banking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-British proposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate.     But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals.     \"There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter stages,\" one representative of the German Banking Association in Cologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year.     All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, West Germany\'s four major banking associations and the Federal Banking Supervisory Office.     Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of Germany\'s credit law, which has been in effect since 1934.     Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it, banking sources said.     Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks\' lending to 18 times shareholders\' equity plus reserves, on a consolidated basis.     But lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts, currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs, currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges.     The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor, and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps. But even if German banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk.     U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous. This is the so-called market-to-market value.     But German authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved, the sources said.     The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks\' securities portfolios, are zero for public authorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers.     A further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put German banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said.     Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S. And British authorities, the sources said.     One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated foreign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different.     How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead-manage mark eurobonds.     But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks\' freedom of movement, particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet, the sources added.  \n',money-fx
'Call money rates fell to 3.85/95 pct from five pct yesterday in moderate trading as month end tightness disappeared and operators took positions for April.     Dealers said they expected rates to remain within a 3.70 to four pct range this month. A minor tax payment period on behalf of customers mid-month, the long Easter weekend and pension payments were unlikely to tighten rates significantly.     Next Wednesday, 14.9 billion marks are leaving the system on the expiry of a securities repurchase pact. But dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to fully replace the outflow with a new tender at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct.     Commerzbank AG\'s management board chairman Walter Seipp called on the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates to protect the mark through bringing the allocation rate for securities repurchase agreements down.     But dealers said the Bundesbank was unlikely to ease credit policies at the moment. There was little domestic and foreign pressure for lower rates and no signs of a change.     Yesterday one or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, dealers said.     Bundesbank figures showed banks held an average daily 50.7 billion marks in minimum reserves at the central bank over the first 30 days of March, the exact requirement needed just one day before the end of the month.     Actual holdings on Monday were 42.0 billion marks.     Because rates soared to the level of the Lombard emergency funding rate yesterday, banks fell back on the loan facility to draw down a high 5.3 billion marks in an attempt to meet Bundesbank needs, the data showed.  \n',money-fx
'Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from 3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week\'s securities repurchase agreement, dealers said.     But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week.     A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers, payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System (EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow.     The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as an earlier securities repurchase pact matured.     Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six billion marks.     The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to redeem them meant a net infusion was needed.     Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks, but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week.     Banks\' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled 53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the first nine days of March.     Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet the requirement toward the end of March.     No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week, but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity if conditions significantly tighten. \"The Bundesbank wants to keep rates around 3.80 pct,\" one dealer said.  \n',money-fx
'West German net currency reserves rose by 200 mln marks in the fourth week of March to 82.2 billion, following a rise of 300 mln marks in the previous week, the Bundesbank said.

'The Bundesbank\'s options for West Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and employers, economists and money market dealers said.     Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to 3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached.     But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round.     One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, \"I don\'t think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.\"     In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation, economists said.     Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy, raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.     As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.     In the current round, the country\'s most powerful union, the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.     The engineering employers\' association, Gesamtmetall, is offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this year and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.     The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe\'s largest union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the public sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.     Though many economists said the unions\' current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of 1984\'s damaging seven-week strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict.     This could extend the length of time in which the Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.     The money market head said the unions\' humiliation by the protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.     \"The unions haven\'t forgotten that and they will put this squarely onto the account in the negotiations,\" he said.     In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall union, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.     More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in south Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours yesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH.     Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in warning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said.     Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on a politically-inhibited Bundesbank.     About eight billion marks were coming into the market tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.     As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank\'s offer to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills, anticipating still lower rates before the month-end.     But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers was due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar, perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling.     Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average 52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first 24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.  \n',money-fx
'Global trading of yen bond futures is just around the corner and they are expected to be listed soon on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), bond managers said.     \"Internationalisation of the yen through expansion of overseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success of global trading of yen bond futures,\" said Katsuyuki Okayasu, general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd\'s bond division.     \"But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulus for the LIFFE yen bond futures market,\" said Tetsuya Dezuka, deputy general manager of the money market section of New Japan Securities Co Ltd, one of the most active yen bond brokers in London.     Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets depends basically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond markets overseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there, dealers said.     Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around 140,000 billion yen, with most held in Japan, they said.     An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February on mutual settlements is expected to link U.S. Treasury bond futures trading in London and Chicago, enabling a continuous 12-hour session, bond managers here said, adding the move was made with yen bond futures trading in mind.     LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futures after receiving approval from Japan\'s Finance Ministry last December.     But futures markets will never take root unless they are backed by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets, dealers said.     Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market now stand at 200 to 300 billion yen, but the extent of investor- linked transactions is unknown, securities bond managers said.     \"Japanese corporations have been actively setting up their financing companies in London, suggesting they increasingly are engaging in, not only fund raising, but management there,\" Dezuka said.     The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanese securities houses in London and the growing numbers of U.S. And U.K. Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market\'s growth, dealers said.     Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to be promoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later this year, securities managers said.     The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bond futures contract, they said.     The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited trading futures of designated foreign government debt securities not located in the issuing country.     Fundamental Brokers Inc, a major U.S. Brokers\' broker, has decided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in New York as early as April.     CBOT\'s start of an evening session, planned for the end of April, will also multiply yen bond futures trading, a Nomura Securities Co Ltd bond manager said. But there are still obstacles to trading on the London market.     \"Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing are major obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE,\" said Koki Chiyojima, deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd\'s bond administration division.     Nikko Securities Co Ltd, one of the big four Japanese securities houses, is responsible for corresponding with LIFFE on these matters.     Japan\'s Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds with coupon payment of either March and September, or June and December from April 1, matching futures delivery months.     The ministry now pays coupons in January, June, July and December. When delivery months and coupon payments do not match, a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earned by non-resident bond holders, a deterrent to LIFFE, securities managers said.     LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount of bonds with matching months increases to over several billion yen, bond managers said.     These bonds will be used for deliveries, as they are expected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to low interest rates, they said.     Market participants here expect a clearing organisation to be set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cash issues, making overseas listings probable in the latter half of 1987.  \n',money-fx
'Finance and economy ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) opened a two- day meeting to discuss further economic integration, officials said.     They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bank governors on a common currency exchange rate.     The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in Saudi Arabia late this year.     The six states have different currency systems. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the International Monetary Fund\'s basket of currencies -- the special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar.     Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by itself.     The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not been disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to be linked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket.     Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE\'s Minister of State for Finance and Industry, said implementation of joint economic agreements \"is increasingly linking the interests of GCC citizens together.\"     The general assembly of the Gulf Investment Corporation met in Abu Dhabi earlier under the chairmanship of Bahrain\'s Finance and National Economy Minister, Ibrahim Abdul-Karim     The corporation was formed to contribute to joint economic and investment projects in the GCC.

'Finance and economy ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have ended talks after adopting resolutions and recommendations aimed at boosting economic integration.     But the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not endorse a resolution on a common currency exchange rate system.     The UAE\'s Minister of State for Finance and Industry, Ahmed Humaid al-Tayer, told reporters after the two-day talks that the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank governors for further discussion.     He said the governors, who agreed in January on a proposed denominator on which the six currencies should be based, were asked to resubmit the recommendation before July, when finance ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia.     Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to discuss the issue, adding there was a possibility that a new system could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summit conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year.     The denominator approved by the governors has not been made public, but banking sources said it could be similar to the European Monetary System (EMS).     Tayer said the ministers agreed in principle to allow GCC citizens to set up businesses and work in any member state. They also agreed in principle on a recommendation for citizens to buy and own shares of GCC shareholding firms.     He said the ministers discussed a report on imported goods containing radiation caused by last year\'s Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union, and agreed all products with excessive levels should be returned to the country of origin.  \n',money-fx
'Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, Gulf International Bank BSC (GIB) said.     The bank\'s economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals.     \"Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts,\" he said.     The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.     Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.     \"Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind,\" he said.     Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges.     But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.     He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had \"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.\"     In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.     Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities\' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets.     He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.     Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.     Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia.     But he added there is \"no bond market to speak of\" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978.     While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said.  \n',money-fx
'Remarks by Japan\'s Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that last month\'s G-6 meeting agreed to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to influence currency trading, dealers said.     After Nakasone\'s statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yen from an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York\'s Friday finish of 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering, they said.     \"I think (Nakasone\'s) desperate,\" said a U.S. Bank foreign exchange manager.     Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen.     Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen.     \"His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150 yen,\" said P.S. Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust.     Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets  and is likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145 yen.

'Liberalization of Italy\'s foreign exchange controls should be \"gradual\" but also \"reasonably rapid,\" a report issued by a study committee nominated by the Italian Treasury Ministry said.    The report, looking at the country\'s financial development prospects, said Italy\'s large public sector deficit and growing public debt were among the considerations that made a gradual liberalization preferable.     The report also favoured retention of the lira\'s six pct oscillation band with the European Monetary System (EMS) during the liberalization process in order to lessen short-term domestic interest rate fluctuations which could result from portfolio adjustments.     The lira\'s fluctuation margin is currently significantly higher than that allowed for other EMS currencies.

'This week\'s Group of Seven (G-7) meeting in Washington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reached at the Tokyo summit last May to include Italy and Canada in Group of Five (G-5) talks on management of the international monetary system and related issues, the Italian Treasury said.     It said in a statement the G-7 meeting, which Italy plans to attend, will provide a forum for considering the Tokyo accord in the light of events in Paris in February this year.     On February 22, Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of its G-7 partners - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earlier session of talks involving G-5 members.

'The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling, trading house officials said.     The officials tolds MITI asked them to moderate their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy. It made the request by telephone.     A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters. But he said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling.     The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would have on the economy.     The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when exchange rates fluctuate widely. A similiar survey was made when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149.98 on January 19. It hit a new record low of 148.20 yen yesterday.     He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall.  \n',money-fx
'The Bank of Japan bought a modest amount of dollars this morning, possibly around 200 to 300 mln, dealers said.     One dealer said the central bank bought about 200 mln dlrs through brokers and the rest through banks. The buying began when the dollar was at about 149.60 yen, and helped drive the U.S. Currency up to around 150, he said.     Another said the central bank seemed to be trying to push the dollar up above 150 yen. But heavy selling at around that level quickly pushed the dollar back down towards 149 yen, dealers said.  \n',money-fx
'Japan cannot bear a further rise of the yen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said.     \"A further stronger yen would be a misfortune for Japan and the Japanese people would not be able to bear such a burden,\" he told reporters.     The minister said he wants to tell U.S. Political leaders of the sacrifices Japan is making to cut its trade surplus.     Kuranari was widely expected to fly to Washington tomorrow for talks focussing on trade. But departure remains uncertain because of the continuing parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting plans for a new sales tax.     If the boycott is lifted tomorrow, Kuranari would probably have to remain in Japan to attend parliamentary discussions on the government\'s 1987/88 budget, Japanese officials said.     Kuranari said both the U.S. And Japan should approach the trade imbalance in a calm, unemotional manner.     But, he added, \"If the issue of rice is to be raised...I would mention the feelings of the Japanese people.\"     Japanese politicians have said repeatedly the country cannot bow to U.S. Pressure to liberalize rice imports because the issue is too sensitive.  \n',money-fx
'Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank will carefully consider its monetary policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar.     Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in its discount rate, he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy.     He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year.     Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in inflation, with money supply growth accelerating, he said.     Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices, exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan.     Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar\'s fall, he said.     The dollar\'s steep fall stems from the market\'s belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said.  \n',money-fx

'Japan is becoming dangerously isolated again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth, officials and businessmen from around the world said.     As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen, making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.     The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.     The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation\'s lifestyle. There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation.\"     Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.     The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact.     British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture.     On Friday, European currency dealers said European central banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.     Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community. \"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report,\" he said.     \"We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demand...Would take time,\" Saito said.     Saito\'s words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I only know that your government, under the leadership of Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\"     And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And we hope to see changes occur in the near future,\" visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.     Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa\'s report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.     Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem.     \"We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,\" said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.     \"The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour,\" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers.     Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.     Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue.     He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and steel industries.     A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy. Europeans are confused about this, underlined by von Moltke\'s reference to the \"leadership\" of the Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last September\'s government programme of new economic measures. \"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report,\" the ambassador said.  \n',money-fx

'The Finance Ministry has asked trust banks to moderate their dollar selling, trust banking sources said.     A Ministry official tolds earlier this week the Ministry had recently surveyed foreign exchange transactions by institutional investors, but he declined to say whether this was aimed at moderating the dollar sales.     Dealers said institutional investors were reluctant to sell dollars aggressively today partly because of the Ministry monitoring.     One senior trust bank source said that while sympathizing with the Ministry position, the trust banks had to conduct their foreign exchange operations according to the dictates of the market.     A Bank of Japan official said the central bank approved of the survey as long it was not used too forcefully.     But another official denied local press reports that the central bank itself had asked investors to moderate their dollar sales. \"We are not legally authorized to do that,\" he said.     A Bank of Japan official also said the central bank will renew its call on financial institutions to moderate excessive loans for the purpose of land and securities investment as such investments threaten to cause inflation.     Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita had previously expressed concern about excessive investment in land and securities resulting partly from eased credit conditions.  \n',money-fx
'Japan will seek to strengthen the Paris accord on currency stability at the meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations tomorrow, Japanese officials said.     However, the officials travelling with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified, would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord, which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in February, to be strengthened.     Currency target zones, or reference ranges, will not be discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow, the Japanese officials said.     The meeting, which is being held in conjunction with this week\'s International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions, will reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing  the language used in the Paris accord, the officials said.     Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker early in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates, officials said, but they declined to disclosed the details of that discussion.     The Japanese officials also declined to detail what Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent American intervention.     The officials said such a money market action to stabilize the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan, which is suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency, but also for the benefit of the United States as well.     As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus, Japan will explain economic measures to the G-7, the officials said.     However, Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today because the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by the Diet, or parliament, despite the new fiscal year which started April one, the officials said.     Japan\'s ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own economic package today calling for more than 5,000 billion yen in additional spending.  \n',money-fx
'The government is determined to ride out the latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measures because it expects the currency\'s appreciation to prove temporary, senior officials said.     \"The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) and market forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit,\" one senior Finance Ministry official said.     He attributed the dollar\'s fall in recent days to special factors, in particular, selling by Japanese investors ahead of the March 31 end to their fiscal year.     That selling largely came to an end this morning after about one hour of trading here, the senior official said. \"They (the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o\'clock (0100 GMT),\" he said.     After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning, the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20. Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar above 150 yen.     Several officials said they did not see any fundamental reason for the dollar\'s recent sharp fall.     One official even called the market\'s recent actions irrational. If anything, the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs on Japanese electronics goods should support the dollar against the yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S., He said.     As a result, several officials said they saw no reason to alter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at last month\'s meeting of major nations in Paris.     \"We don\'t see any substantial reason to change our policy stance,\" one senior official said. \n',money-fx

'The dollar\'s tumble to a record low of 144.70 yen in Tokyo today motivated some major Japanese investors to lighten their U.S. Bond inventory further and is expected to spur diversification into investment assets including foreign and domestic shares, dealers said.     The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a low of 96.08-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 98.05-06 New York finish, then recovered to 96.20-22.     Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investment trusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on the foreign exchange market here today, accentuating the unit\'s tumble, securities house dealers said.     They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cash positions resulting from their dollar sales today, and are sidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest rates outlook clarifies, a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency trader said.     The dollar\'s plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds will further promote diversification into other foreign investments, as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock markets from overseas bond markets, securities bond managers said.     They said major Japanese investors in the past two years are estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign portfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S. Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct.     Since late last year, Japanese investors, seeking substantial liquidity and attractive yields, have used fresh funds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and, after the Paris currency pact, actively bought French franc bonds and gilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories, the managers said.     Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowed into local bond and stock markets as well.     The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a record low of 4.080 pct today from the 4.140 Saturday finish and compared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit.     The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points for more than a month here, suggesting most dealers could not satisfy their needs for capital gains, dealers said.     A market survey bys showed some active accounts in U.S. Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo\'s stock market. The stock market\'s bullishness late last week was partly due to funds transferred from U.S. Treasuries, dealers said.     Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the first half of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared with average monthly net purchases of 7.7 billion for the whole of 1986, Finance Ministry sources said.     The steep fall is due to Japanese investors\' cool attitude towards U.S. Bonds, which had amounted to more than 80 pct of total foreign securities purchased, securities houses managers said.     Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed the record high of 1.5 billion dlrs seen in December, they said.     \"Diversification of foreign portfolios is underway and we have bought bonds in currencies such as marks, the Canadian dollar, the ECU and French franc,\" a fund manager at Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd said.  \n',money-fx
'Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed today\'s announcement of a further half point cut in British bank base lending rates to 10 pct.     However, he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to declines in domestic U.K. Interest rates, although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly.     He told a briefing of economic journalists that \"I don\'t think we should rush anything.\" Lawson stressed the themes of \"gradualism and steadiness\" as economic policy.     Lawson acknowledged that today\'s fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88, unveiled yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct of GDP.     Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates, both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines, were \"perfectly consistent\" with monetary conditions now in Britain.     He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply aggregate was \"safely inside\" its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget, Lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3.     Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS), Lawson repeated that \"it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election.\"     He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS membership under constant review. But he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government.     Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls.     Although Lawson denounced what he said was \"the current wave of election fever\" in Britain, he added:  \"It is more likely that there will be an election this year\" than not.     He said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air. \"Ideally, we (the government) should have a full term,\" but events could force a premature poll, Lawson said.     The government, which has been in power since 1979, must call an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either a June or an early autumn election, political sources said.     The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88 \"was the right balance, economically and politically,\" he said.     Lawson\'s decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predicted that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move.     But it was being praised today by political analysts as a shrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate.     Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion stg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg.     Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawson stressed that \"they are not an objective (for the government) - they are an instrument of policy.\" Consequently the Treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said.     But \"there may be interest rate consequences\" from changes in the level of government borrowing, he added.     Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.\'s relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in Britain.     He said conditions created by London\'s role as a leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries.     Three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in Britain, Lawson said.     First, control of credit in Britain rested on interest rates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets.     He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party.      Thirdly, he said \"we do not have as long a track record of low inflation\" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany.     Lawson foresaw London becoming the world\'s pre-eminent financial centre, because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than New York or Tokyo.  \n',money-fx
'U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel today repeated that he was satisfied with the current level of sterling, both against the dollar and the West German mark.     Lawson said in a television interview that he did not regard the pound\'s present exchange rate was uncomfortably high.     \"I think it is round about right,\" he said.     \"I think there was a time that they (British manufacturers) thought the (exchange) rate was uncomfortably high. But I think they are very satisfied with the present level.\"     \"But I have made it absolutely clear that I don\'t want to see the pound go through the roof,\" he added.  \n',money-fx
'British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not the only element standing in the way of full British membership of the European Monetary System (EMS).     But he added that arguments against joining had weakened.     Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be the strongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has made clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the next UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest.     But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters after an informal European Community finance ministers\' meeting here that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in the way of full membership.     In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which Britain should enter the EMS\'s core exchange rate mechanism, there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system to be considered, he said.     British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling system, he noted. \"We have to make sure it would work.\"     But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem.     As an example he cited sterling\'s role as a petrocurrency, which he said was diminishing. \"That argument has clearly weakened,\" he said.     Lawson restated that the government was keeping the question of membership under review.  \n',money-fx
'Leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability, but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth.     The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month\'s talks seem likely to build on that stability.     A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm.     But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood, \"That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in fact what has happened since Paris.\"     Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.     Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.     The official refused to comment, however, on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year.     On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.     The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future international talks.     \"I think these changes will strengthen the President\'s hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora,\" said the official, an Administration economic policymaker. \"So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives.\"     But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.     Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret  short-term target ranges for their currencies with a specific agreement to defend those bands with intervention.     According to market sources, the ranges agreed were 1.60 to 1.90 marks to the dollar, and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar.     There is no official confirmation that specific bands  were set, although the agreement used the term \"ranges\", for the first time in an international economic agreement.     The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to foster currency stability around current levels.     Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached 1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling\'s strength.     International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers, who will review market performance and their own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund.     The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.     Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing, while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.     Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit.     A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany.     But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank.     \"If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it, it would no longer be private,\" said the official, who asked not to be identified.     Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S. Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated action could be on the April agenda.  \n',money-fx

In Paris, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to coooperate to hold currency rates around their then current levels.     Miyazawa would not say what specific measures major nations would take, but told reporters the measures had been discussed in Paris.

'Middle East currency dealers meet in Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their business, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from the Arab world to London.     The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf currency system is more real that at any time this decade.     Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these issues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected to be major talking points.     About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks -- including some in London and other major non-Arab financial centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins on on Saturday.     Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market, by far the largest in the region, is being carried out in London.     The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia\'s 11 banks, foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in Bahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based banks are boosting their treasury operations in London.     As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade finance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain ran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K. Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.     The two major Bahrain-based international banks, Arab Banking Corp and Gulf International Bank BSC have increased their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading representative offices to branch status to allow dealing.     One economist said: \"It is cheaper to run a riyal book in London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain... There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.\"     Jeddah-based Riyad Bank set up as a licensed deposit taker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia, National Commercial Bank (NCB) won a licence in November 1986.     The major market maker has traditionally been London-based consortium bank Saudi International Bank but the kingdom joint-venture Saudi American Bank (SAMBA) also upgraded its London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February.     One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: \"Inevitably the volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new licences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.\"     Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi riyal market is difficult to quantify.     Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency deposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986 from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.     The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now staff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect Arab National Bank to step up London operations.     Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market moving completely out of the region, partly because of local demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency\'s (SAMA) desire to moderate internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue speculation.     There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain and London is still limited.     But for the first time since the formation of the six nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.     Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.     But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary System style with a common peg have been discussed at high level and could be a topic on the GCC\'s annual summit expected to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year.     One dealer said: \"A lot of exposure is being given to discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.\"     One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.     The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated since the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently linked to a basket of currencies while the other five currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the U.S. Dollar.     Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies, but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of 7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.     Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks.  \n',money-fx

The minister believes that market forces will push the dollar back up from its record low of 144.70 yen today, according to the spokesman.

'The monetary authorities of the major industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and widespread central bank intervention, dealers said.     The dollar\'s fall below 150 yen, which follows last month\'s Paris currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal of the success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plaza meeting to weaken the dollar, they said.     The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on different sides, dealers said.     Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations has encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite concerted intervention by the central banks of the United States, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said.     Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was no target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway.     Yesterday\'s comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris accord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said.     The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita, which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a halt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they noted.     The situation has again raised the question of whether intervention can succeed against the trend in today\'s huge currency markets. Dealers said the market\'s cool response to intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars.     \"This means that the current dollar selling is not of a sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand,\" said Koichi Miyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank.     Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the intervention and it is only a matter of time before some operators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 149.40 against New York\'s 149.30/40. Its record low was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday.     Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to rise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again.     The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus Italy) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies apart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said.     Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris accord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing to prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S. Trade deficit, especially with Japan.     Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a lower dollar is also limiting Washington\'s options, they said.     The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow the dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said Tadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.     Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large forward dollar sales from April to June for export bills falling due for Japanese exporters from April to September.     The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen depreciation, dealers said.     Yesterday\'s request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks ineffective in light of this real demand, they said.     The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new business year starting April 1, dealers said.     \"The market seems to have established a new dollar trading range between 147 and 149 yen,\" one dealer said.     The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris accord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low end for the dollar against the yen, he said.     Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148 yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to 145.  \n',money-fx
'Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations is intended to produce \"reasonable stability\" in exchange markets over the next few months.     He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Five nations and Canada agreed in Paris to \"see if there can\'t be a period of reasonable stability instead of volatility\" to give time for the committments in Paris to take place.     Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. intervention was not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied that the administration judged that after economic adjustments, current exchange rates reflect underlying economic fundamentals.     In particular, the stability sought by the nations would allow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies domestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulford said in his testimony.     He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would hurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth.     Mulford noted that half of West Germany\'s economy was affected by international developments.     He also said increased Japanese domestic growth would result in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarily lead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Gramm asserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market.     Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, \"I think exchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany\'s and Japan\'s) efforts can be carried out.     Mulford rejected Gramm\'s argument that faster domestic growth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lower dollar.     Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. trade deficit.     Otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolved either through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession, both alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable.  \n',money-fx

'The highly visible drama involving the yen\'s sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said.     The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, tolds the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances.     Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.     In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one.     But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said.     The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.     \"You have to look at the dollar\'s peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza,\" he said.     On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down.     Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen.     The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.     Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.     Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.     \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.     The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.     The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems.     \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want my objective view, I don\'t expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again,\" he said. ... \n',money-fx

The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction.     This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower \"marginal\" rate, analysts said.     \"It should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered,\" a Western diplomat commented.     The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct since the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM), began last September 26.     At last week\'s session the Nigerian currency was fixed at 4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row.     \"They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend,\" the diplomat said.     The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2.     It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday\'s scheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank was planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction.     Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira.     If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objective of the new system, analysts said.     Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- the lowest successful bid.     SFEM is a central part of Nigeria\'s structural adjustment program, which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in Black Africa.     The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalising imports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy.     The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards.     Ishrat Husain, the World Bank\'s representative in Nigeria, said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions.     \"So far so good\" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos, adding that only members of Nigeria\'s import-dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit.     Fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect, he said.     Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira\'s black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last September.  \n',money-fx
'The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct against the dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding at today\'s weekly foreign exchange auction, the central bank said. The naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar, against 3.9050 last week.     Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold, with all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency.     The effective rate, including a central bank levy, for transactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last week.     The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the central bank\'s unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as punishment for inadequate documentation in previous transactions.

Comments by Japanese officials and Bank of Japan dollar support had pushed it above 145 yen and 1.80 marks after falling as low as 144.50 and 1.7860 respectively in Tokyo.  \n',money-fx
'The Bundesbank did not intervene as the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243 yesterday, dealers said.     Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the European morning, with operators made wary by today\'s meeting of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs ahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington.     It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S. Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar.     Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange rates at about current levels, made at the Paris meeting on February 22, a \"vague statement,\" casting doubt on operators\' assumptions that a secret target level had been set.     Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged, \"there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the dollar.\"     One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tended easier after the remarks. \"They were obviously regarded as being negative. And if the market starts regarding anything that comes out negatively then it means that the underlying sentiment is negative,\" he said.     Some early selling pressure softened the dollar\'s undertone.     Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by institutional investors and overseas operators, dealers said.     After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recent weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31, interest and activity was likely to switch, dealers said.     \"We can start to look at a point in time where the interest shifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and the other European currencies,\" the U.S. Bank dealer said.     Despite the softer undertone, traders would remain wary of taking significant new positions during the Washington meetings, dealers said. Aside from the G-5 session today, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German Affairs group on international monetary issues later.     The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set a new securities repurchase tender to add money market liquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct, unchanged from those over the last several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that it might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender, signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy.     Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. A monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate oriented policy, he said, contradicting some growing sentiment.     Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from 2.957. The yen\'s unabated strength, despite the intervention, brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday\'s 1.2480.     The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from 120.180. The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after 30.060, Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per 100.  \n',money-fx
'Zimbabwe\'s Reserve Bank, the nation\'s central bank, has denied the Zimbabwe dollar would be devalued.     Bank Governor Kombo Moyana told The Herald daily newspaper \"unfortunate and completely unfounded speculation that a depreciation of the Zimbabwe dollar was about to occur\" had aggravated a serious foreign exchange shortage.     \"During February and the early part of March this (speculation) caused importers to bring forward their payments and exporters to delay as long as possible the inward remittance of export receipts, resulting in a significant slowdown in net foreign exchange inflows,\" he added.  \n',money-fx
'Lebanese central bank Vice Governor Meguerditch Bouldikian called for the establishment of an Arab fund to assist the Lebanese pound, which has lost more than 80 pct of its value against the dollar since January 1986.     Bouldikian told an Arab exchange dealers conference the bank would continue to take measures to defend the currency.     But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for its war-battered economy now more than ever before. \"We expect a common effort between the central bank and Arab central banks and monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support and preserve the value of the currency when needed,\" he said.     Twelve years of civil war have devastated productive sectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade and budget deficits.     Bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded in reducing demand for imports and increasing exports. \"These are encouraging factors, but the war has not ended yet,\" he said.     \"We believe that with a just political solution acceptable to all sides, confidence will return and this will benefit the Lebanese pound and Lebanon.\"     In the meantime, he said the central bank had four main goals:     1) to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit     2) to increase the role of commercial banks and non-bank financing institutions in financing the deficit     3) to limit the transfer of Lebanese pounds into foreign currency deposits     4) to protect the financial health of commercial banks.  \n',money-fx
'Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton said the Paris pact agreed between six leading industrialised nations set no nominal exchange rate targets.     Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committee that \"we did not swap numbers - we reached an understanding\" on how to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around their current levels.     He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of joint currency float - but one which let it still purse an independent monetary policy. \"I would concede that, since the Louvre Accord, we are acting as if we are in something,\" Leigh-Pemberton said.     \"The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effective role for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together\" towards stabilising exchange rates,\" Leigh-Pemberton said.     He did not mention this week\'s intervention by central banks to support the dollar, after markets decided to test the accord.      Leigh-Pemberton said that \"the effectiveness of this (cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought in the pre-Plaza days\" before September 1985.     He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that \"we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing.\"     He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that \"we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing.\"     Leigh-Pemberton said that, in principle, the Bank of England favoured full EMS membership for sterling, provided such a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetary policy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates lower, he said \"the two half point cuts (this month in banks\' base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now.\"     Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a \"cautious step-by-step approach\" to reducing short term interest rates, not least because \"we have a potential problem with inflation.\"     Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, \"one of the highest\" among industrialised nations, he added.     Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted base rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budget on March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets for such a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10 pct.     Regarding sterling\'s relationship with oil, Leigh-Pemberton said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall.     He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England\'s sterling index, when compared with the index\'s level before oil prices dropped from around the 30 dlr level. The index, base 1975, closed here today at 72.1, unchanged from the previous close.  \n',money-fx
'U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies.     Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson replied, \"we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.\" When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said \"I do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not to make it easy for\" speculation against the accord.     Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors.     But if such movements were due to extraneous factors, Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges.     \"It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to make its own economy more export oriented,\" Lawson said.     In his oral evidence to Parliament\'s Select Treasury Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound\'s current level, adding that \"It is an objective ... To try to keep it around that level.\"     He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the pound had weathered that period so successfully. \"There has been a reassessment of sterling\'s fundamentals,\" Lawson said.  He disagreed with what he termed \"the grossly exaggerated claim\" that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of other major industrialsed countries.     Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average.     Lawson confirmed that \"over the medium and longer term, the government\'s objective is zero inflation.\"     He said the government\'s intention of its PSBR constant at 1.0 pct of GDP \"is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine.\"  He added that \"to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply a recipe for accelerating inflation.\"  \n',money-fx
'Peru will put into effect today a foreign exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide in the country\'s international reserves, a government decree in the Official Gazette said.     Under the system, importers will be required to present a bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license for foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days to decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange.     Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago.     The system will be effective until the end of 1988.     A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by a council with members from the central bank, the economy ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in accordance with guidelines set by the council.     Peru\'s reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in 1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates.    Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against 2.97 billion in 1985.  \n',money-fx
'The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend its trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets, exchange president Nicholas Giordano said.     He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between 1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the third quarter this year.     The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve clients in the region and educate financial markets about the advantages of currency options, Giordano said.     Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the exchange-trade currency option market against existing over-the-counter option trading during the local working day.     Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and had grown in popularity, he said.     The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000 contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30 billion U.S. Dlrs.     Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000 contracts traded daily.     Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities, set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries access to a currency option market of much greater depth and liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.  \n',money-fx
'The Philippines must devalue the peso if it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod tolds.     \"The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports more competitive,\" Monsod said an interview. \"No question about it. I\'m saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies.\"     The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar.     Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions.     Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance. \"If the dollar rate goes higher, our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the financing is very difficult,\" she said. \"But I am looking at it in terms of the economy.\"     She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.     \"I\'m just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead.\"     Monsod said, \"The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates) of the Philippines versus the other country. It\'s an arithmetic thing.\"     Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year.     He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.     The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the dollar when it was floated in 1984.  \n',money-fx
'Interest in the currency futures market has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies, analysts said.     The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the dollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom.     \"Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and technically, the pound is in the best shape,\" PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said.     \"We\'ve tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and we\'re going to stay with that, there\'s no reason to change,\" Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said.     Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark futures positions, although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday, Sloane said.      The fundamental keys to the pound\'s rise have been relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy, analysts said.     \"Money seems to be chasing yields,\" William Byers, of Bear Stearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate.     Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nation\'s budget is released March 17.     The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how well it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency.     However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K. interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates, and extend the pound\'s rally, Sloane said.     The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon.     The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with smaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a \"bull flag\" on price charts, technically-oriented analysts said.     \"It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout,\" in this case to the upside, Sloane said.     Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar.     \"At this stage of the game I\'d call the market long-term positive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above (the previous contract high of) 75.25,\" Byers said.     As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts.     Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400, respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430.     Yesterday\'s rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada.     \"We may still probe to see what the parameters are,\" Byers said, \"but people are very reluctant because they don\'t know where the central banks will be (to intervene).\"     Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at that level.  \n',money-fx
'Taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered about 3.4 billion U.S. Dlrs in exchange rate losses from July 1986 to February 1987 as a result of the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Currency.     Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to increase as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen.     The Taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the U.S. Dollar today, has risen about 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since September 1985. Some bankers expect it to rise to 33 by June and to 32 by the end of this year.     Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves now total 53 billion dlrs. At end-February they were 52.1 billion dlrs, the world\'s third largest after West Germany and Japan.     Yu said the interest earned from the reserves totalled about 1.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from July 1986 to February 1987. The reserves are managed by the central bank and deposited at about 170 leading banks in the U.S., Japan, Britain, Canada and Singapore.     About 75 pct of the reserves are in the form of cash, mostly in U.S. Dollars. The rest are in government treasury bills, certificates of deposit and bonds.  \n',money-fx
'Shifts in domestic economic policy, not a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions, are the key to reducing imbalances in trade and payments, Dutch Finance Miniister H. Onno Ruding said.     Ruding told a meeting of the World Trade Forum here that protectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravate the problems of heavily indebted developing countries.     \"The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous U.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the dollar, is not still more protectionism in your country.\"     \"No, it is - like in other countries - changes in domestic economic and financial policies,\" Ruding said.     Ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of the weakening dollar than he was in January before the Paris accord to stabilize foreign exchange rates.     He said the highest priority should be given to policy changes in the United States, especially reducing the budget deficit and encouraging domestic savings.     But he said other countries, such as Japan and West Germany, also needed to take greater steps toward reducing their trade surpluses.  \n',money-fx
'South Korea\'s Finance Minister Chung In-yong will visit U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker next week to discuss U.S. Requests for an appreciation of South Korea\'s won against the dollar, finance ministry officials said.     They said Chung would leave for Washington on Monday to attend the International Monetary Fund\'s (IMF) Interim Committee meeting and for talks with U.S. Officials on ways of reducing Seoul\'s trade surplus with Washington.     The dates for the Baker-Chung meeting have yet to be set.     The IMF committee meeting, scheduled for April 9, is expected to review the resolution reached by the six top industrialised nations in Paris last month calling for newly industrialised countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, to allow their currencies to rise.     The official said Chung is expected to outline Seoul\'s efforts to increase imports of U.S. Goods and to stress the need for South Korea to maintain a trade surplus in the next few years in order to cut foreign debts totalling some 44.5 billion dlrs.     South Korea has ruled out a major revaluation of the won, but is allowing its currency to appreciate slowly.     Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this month a sudden won revaluation could result in South Korea running a large trade deficit and being forced to renege on its international debt repayments.     The Bank of Korea, the central bank, today fixed the won at a two-year high of 846.90. The won has gained 5.1 pct since the beginning of 1986.

'The financial rand, widely viewed as a direct reflection of foreign investor confidence in South Africa, appears headed above 30 U.S. Cents, dealers and bank economists said.     The currency has risen about 25 pct in the past three months to its current rate of 29.50 cents, due partly to signs of a possible power shift with the appearance of a number of independent candidates in the whites-only election on May 6, they added.     It has risen about two cents this week alone.     \"Another factor is that banks in London, where the main market is based, are going long in the currency because of a general feeling that it will rise in the future,\" one economist said.     Dealers described 30 cents as a psychological barrier that was expected to be broken soon after a brief consolidation phase from recent gains.     After reaching 30 cents, \"There is a chance of appreciation to 32 cents in the next several weeks,\" one dealer said.     There was a widespread feeling that both the commercial rand, holding stable at 48 cents, and the financial rand were staying firm, banking sources said.     A Barclays National Bank executive who asked not to be identified said: \"The rise of the independents appears to be indicative of a potential shift of power in the National Party and has created a favourable sentiment overseas.\"     One dealer said growing business and investor interest from West Germany and Switzerland were behind the financial rand\'s rise.     Economists said foreigners also were being attracted by South Africa\'s long-term government bonds and \"semi-gilts\" or securities in partly government-owned firms, many with yields as high as 30 pct. They could be purchased with financial rands with interest paid in commercial rands.     \"This has had a definite influence on the financial form of the rand,\" a dealer said, adding that at present demand is slightly in excess of supply.     The financial rand was reintroduced in September 1985 to help end capital flight from South Africa during a period of severe political unrest in the country.  \n',money-fx

'Japanese short-term interest rates, buoyed recently by seasonal factors, are likely to fall from the beginning of April when the new financial year begins, money traders said.     The Bank of Japan is expected to encourage the trend following its attempts to pressure rates to enhance its discount rate cut on February 23, they said.     The Bank cut the rate to 2.5 pct from three, and began actively injecting funds into the money market to offset rate rises resulting from the end-of-fiscal-year surge in demand for funds from financial institutions.     Despite its attempts to dampen rates with measures such as aggressive commercial bill purchases, the central bank has failed to remove all upward pressure, money traders said.     Attractive interest rates offered by domestic banks to compete for time deposits of more than 600 mln yen has underpinned short-term rates, they said.     Interest rates on time deposits of more than 600 mln yen were decontrolled by the Finance Ministry last September.     This resulted in such deposits with domestic banks rising to 17,830 billion yen by the end-December, a three-fold increase on end-December 1985 levels, bankers said.     On March 31, the money market expects to see a 2,000 billion yen surplus resulting from government payment of fiscal funds, money traders said.     From April 1, they predict the unconditional call rate will fall to 3.5000 pct from 3.7500 pct today and the one-month commercial bill discount rate to drop to 3.7500 pct from 4.0635 pct.     They predict the three-month bill discount rate to slip to 3.875 pct from 4.0000 today and the three-month certificate of deposit rate to slide to 4.10/4.15 from 4.35/25.  \n',money-fx

'The Bank of Spain raised overnight call money rates by 1/4 to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas in today\'s auction, which a bank spokesman termed \"heavy.\"     Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds, the spokesman said.     He said in reply tos inquiries that rates could rise further if money supply growth rose above this year\'s eight pct target for M-4, defined as liquid assets in public hands.     Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January. Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986.     A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying a more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation.     The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year.     \"Money supply control is the government\'s chief weapon against inflation,\" he said. \"The problem is higher rates are attracting liquidity from abroad.\"     He said this was why the central bank enacted specific measures to control the inflow of foreign capital. The Bank of Spain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curb short-term speculative capital from abroad.  \n',money-fx
'The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with European Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the ending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said.     \"The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift restrictions on foreign currency operations, in line with deregulation in the banking industry,\" he said in a telephone interview.     The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday.     The central bank said in a statement the measures included increased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provision for future pension fund obligations.     It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate Spain\'s financial sector, a move triggered by entry into the Community last year.     Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, a process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign banks to open branches.     Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and they now control about 15 pct of the system\'s lending assets.     Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign currency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas.     The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between that date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the country on new foreign currency loans.     The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion pesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would be given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days.     Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign currency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, by issuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper.     They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign issues, while before they had to be converted into deposits.     Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies, instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency.     The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the amount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limited to three times a bank\'s capital equity.     The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most bankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates.     The reserve requirement, which was already in place on normal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreign speculative capital which is entering the country and threatening the government\'s money supply growth target.     A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which now account for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at a disadvantage with European competitors.     The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of interest rate deregulation. \"The real problem is the freeing of interest rates,\" the banker said. \"This is going to take a big bite out of profits.\"     The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to 180 days.     The chairman of one of Spain\'s leading banks said the measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this year.  \n',money-fx
'The move by foreign exchange markets to test the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into question the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said.     Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risen sharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index.     While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and dollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high U.K. Interest rates.     But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday.     The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to intervene. Analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively, the Paris accord could collapse.     \"On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6 collapses,\" Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said.     He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies.     However, although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp drop in the U.K. Currency.     Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K. Political and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates, they said.     Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been running especially high after last week\'s budget, seen as popular both with the markets and with British voters.     Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the West German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K.     Recent opinion polls showing Britain\'s ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound.     In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two half-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than two weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the next week or so, has already been largely discounted.     U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still relatively high compared to other western countries, and analysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely to affect sterling.     Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar\'s decline, dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis.     Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond (gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point.     Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling.     Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this Thursday\'s U.K. Current account figures for February.     Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg after January\'s small surplus.  \n',money-fx
'West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in February had been successful and would be continued.     Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week\'s International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: \"The ... Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has proven its worth and will also determine future developments.\"     Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar around 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany\'s exports.     He said studies by international organisations had made it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy.     \"No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, the U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strong under-valuation,\" he said.     Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the current trade dispute over semi-conductors.     Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris currency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not been published.     The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which central banks of the major industrialised countries would intervene. Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully considered.

'Sudan has rejected a demand by the International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported.     Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods.     SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan.     Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year.     In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency.     Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices. Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers.     Dealers in Khartoum\'s thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5.5 pounds today.     With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire.     Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan\'s economic performance.     The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country\'s economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears.     This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to reschedule debt payments.     Twenty-three pct of Sudan\'s total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said.     Sudan\'s Finance Minister said last month the country\'s IMF representative had told him the fund\'s executive board was \"very pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months.\"     The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more.     Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30.  \n',money-fx
'Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations.     Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations.     Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita\'s statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.     \"It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates,\" Sumita said.     The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system, he said.     The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris statement said.  \n',money-fx
'Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said he does not expect the dollar to remain unstable and fall further.     He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the Bank of Japan would continue to cooperate closely with other major nations to stabilize exchange rates.     The central bank has been keeping extremely careful watch on exchange rate movements since last week, he said.     He said the dollar would not continue to fall because of underlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen.     Sumita said the currency market has been reacting to overseas statements and to trade tension between Japan and the U.S. over semiconductors.     The yen\'s tendency to rise will prevent Japan from expanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economic restructuring, he said.  \n',money-fx
'The International Swap Dealers Association has developed the first standard form contract for use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap transactions, said Thomas Jasper, the Association\'s co-chairman.     The contract, unveiled at a press conference , is expected to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient, he said. \"The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce the expense of swap documentation,\" Japsper said.     Privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all new issues eventually become part of either an interest rate or currency swap.     An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usually acting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other\'s interest payments on debt securities. Usually, the issuer of a floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice versa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains with the original borrower.     Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of swaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient capital to cushion it.     Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and president of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital standards for counterparties in swaps.     The standards are part of the recently announced convergence agreement between the two countries in which regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements for institutions.     McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a \"level playing field\" be maintained in the swaps market.     He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more primary capital against swap transactions than is the current practice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to issuers.     The issuers might then choose to do business with lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking rules.     He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort.     That code should be completed within the next few weeks, he said.  \n',money-fx

'The Swiss National Bank bought dollars against yen today, a spokesman for the bank said.     He declined to say how many dollars the bank bought or when precisely it intervened.     Swiss foreign exchange dealers described the National Bank\'s purchases as modest, perhaps amounting to no more than 20 or 30 mln dlrs.     The Bank of France, which was reported buying dollars against the yen in Paris, had made inquiries with Swiss banks as well, and the Bundesbank had also intervened. Bank of Japan dollar purchases today were perhaps 1.2 to 1.5 billion dlrs.     Dealers said this tended to confirm the market\'s impression that major industrial countries had agreed at the Paris meeting on an effective floor for the dollar of 148 yen, and the market seemed ready to test it.     Commercial clients were also selling dollars against the yen as the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 drew closer. Today\'s dealings in spot currencies are booked for March 31.     One dealer said he had the feeling Japanese companies had been asked by the Bank of Japan not to sell dollars at this point, but some, while sticking to the letter of that request, were offering dollars forward today, rather than lose out if the dollar fell further.     The run on the dollar against the yen came in a market thinned by the absence of many dealers for a Forex Club meeting in Hamburg.     Trading was, in fact, rather light against currencies other than the yen, the dollar holding little changed through the day.

'Taiwan\'s new controls on currency inflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a flood of speculative money prompted by the local currency surge against the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said.     The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding one mln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance and bank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source.     Petitioners have to show their remittances relate to genuine commercial transactions.     Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report all outward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight, insurance and royalties, to the central bank.     But bankers said they believed the new controls would be ineffective since businessmen could split up remittances into smaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan\'s flourishing currency black market.     The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are a panic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over the past week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to slow the growth of Taiwan\'s exports to the U.S.     The government has denied local press reports Washington is pressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs.     The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70.     \"I don\'t think the central bank has a final target,\" said an executive with a U.S. Bank. Other bankers and economists said they are wary of making any firm predictions about how far the Taiwan dollar will rise.     Taiwan\'s trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985. The surplus widened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billion dlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year.     Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative money flowed into Taiwan in 1986.     This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more than 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last year and provided further upward pressure on the currency.     The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against the U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouraging speculators.     Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last week Washington\'s pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves meant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable.     Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the currency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow the local dollar to find its own level.     \"Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but the central bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not want to take the risk,\" said one local banker.     He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary measure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with the exchange rate problem.     The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt around the real issue, he said.     Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign exchange controls, said an executive with a western bank.     \"The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bank charges will not outweigh the profits of speculation,\" said the manager of a European bank.     Economists criticised the controls, saying they could antagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economic liberalisation in Taiwan.     \"Instead of liberalising outflows, the government has restricted inflows,\" said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickers da Costa.     A local banker, who declined to be named, said, \"It\'s basically ridiculous. It\'s a backward movement and goes against the government\'s liberalisation programme.\"     Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to enable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow individuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the country each year.  \n',money-fx
'The United States wants Taiwan\'s currency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan\'s trade surplus with the U.S., A senior trade official said.     Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters on Saturday U.S. Officials told him in Washington last week that unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would face retaliation.     Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.S responded to Taiwan\'s request to increase its textile export quotas by promising further talks in May. Taiwan\'s surplus with the U.S. Hit a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986.     Washington signed a three-year accord with Taipei last year limiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year.     Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985.     It surged last week amid indications Washington was seeking a major rise in its value. It rose four cents against the U.S. Dollar on Saturday to close at 34.59.     Western trade sources tolds Taiwan and the U.S. Have been holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not clear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise.  \n',money-fx
'Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financial officials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchange controls and study the possibility of suspending the controls, a cabinet statement said.     The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy and Central Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduce Taiwan\'s surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached a record 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month.     Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministry and the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to ease the controls, but he did not give details.     Yu said the government could maintain the framework of the foreign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. The controls would be used during emergency.     Taiwan\'s reserves have resulted largely from its trade surplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billion in 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan\'s trade with the United States, according to official figures.     But he said that while easing the controls would help reduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in a short time.     Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted from growing pressure from the United States, Taiwan\'s largest trading partner, which buys almost half the island\'s exports.     Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, tolds: \"The decision came a little bit late. But it was better than never.\"     Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, said the government should rapidly relax its foreign exchange controls and open its market wider to help balance trade with its trading partners, especially the United States.     \"The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchange controls will not only help our trading partners, but also help our own economic problems,\" he said.     He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boost Taiwan\'s money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February.  \n',money-fx

'Interest rates on the London money market were slightly firmer on news U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson had stated target rates for sterling against the dollar and mark, dealers said.

Dealers noted the chancellor said he would achieve his goals on sterling by a combination of intervention in currency markets and interest rates.     Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test sterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in U.K. Base lending rates even less likely in the near term, dealers said.     The feeling remains in the market, however, that fundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in U.K. Interest rates is not very likely.

'Britain has reaped profits by using a stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.

The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point.     During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week, he said that \"during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for.\"     He said that that one percentage point increase, effected in October 1986, had been reversed by this month\'s two half point cuts in banks\' base lending rates. They are now at 10 pct.     Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British reserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England intervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the authorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and October 1986, government sources said.  \n',money-fx
'Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford reaffirmed U.S. backing for the Paris Agreement among six industrial nations to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels.     In testimony prepared for delivery before a Senate banking subcommittee, Mulford said there was broad recognition in Paris that \"further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects.\"     But he also said while there are clear understandings among the countries regarding cooperation, \"We have refrained from establishing a system of target zones or ranges.\"     Mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out the way in which they intend to deal with possible market developments.     He said governments must retain flexibility in dealing with exchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigid exchange rate objectives \"or to specify too precisely the goals of intervention\" would hurt official attempts to react to market pressures, he said.     Accordingly, Mulford said setting specific currency objectives and intervention to achieve those objectives would be counterproductive.     Commenting on the trade deficit, Mulford reiterated the Treasury position that the current account deficit will decline from 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs this year, due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18 months.     But he added trade imbalances would also be corrected by commitments from West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies and by U.S. efforts to cut the budget deficit and enhance U.S. competitiveness.     He also said some newly industrialized countries should let their currencies appreciate.  \n',money-fx
'In a bid to hasten Japan\'s promise to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign trade, top U.S. officials appear once again to have signaled their tolerance of a lower dollar.     Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides, Assistant Secretary David Mulford, said last week there was no target for the dollar, a statement that sent the yen soaring against the dollar, despite massive central bank intervention.     \"That was no slip of the tongue,\" said one western monetary official, who asked not to be identified.     For now, the strategy appears to be working. Japanese officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic demand will be ready in early April. Until last week, there were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon.     The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congress over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billion dlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results from Japan, dramatic action is required.     Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries.     The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appease mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes just two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies.     And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the need for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials.     Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in the deficit. \"I\'d be stunned if we were not going to derive some benefits (from the lower dollar) soon,\" said one.     In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting \"underlying economic fundamentals\" or economic reality.     The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United States cutting its budget deficit.     The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada, agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade imbalances.     But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying fundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one.     Markets, in effect, are less confident than governments that these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cuts agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out.     Nonetheless, the dollar\'s sharp fall has not undermined  cooperation. A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was on track and Tokyo and Bonn seem \"to want more stimulative measures which is what the Paris accord calls for.\"     International monetary sources said exchange market developments generally have not unsettled policymakers, although Japan is an obvious exception. \"Everybody feels it can still be managed,\" one source said of market developments.     But last week, the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and other central banks about one billion dlrs.     Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America\'s half-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting the Paris accord outright.     The source, close to the top levels of Japanese economic policymaking, said Japan\'s understanding of the accord was that the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level it stood at when the accord was struck.     The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington\'s use of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies. It was a \"pointed reminder\" to Japan to do something about the trade issues, the source said of the dollar\'s fall against the yen.     By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris accord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability around current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar.     Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target for the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to their international responsibilities and stimulate growth.     But U.S. officials said recent market developments will not unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement.     \"There\'s a realisation now that you cannot leave things alone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalances ought to be adjusted,\" one official said.     \"While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, we certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,\" another U.S. official said.     The officials said the meeting here, where the six will be joined by Italy, will be a status report.     \"Japan will have to explain what the state of their program is and Germany will report on its plans. Maybe there\'s a need to move faster,\" one source said.     Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called, in effect, for currency stability for several months. This would buy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic growth and help bring down the U.S. trade deficit.     His comments appeared to serve notice on other major nations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to reduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses and the U.S. trade deficit.  \n',money-fx
'A leading U.S. Banker said the dollar was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only temporary at current world exchange rate levels.     Kurt Viermetz, worldwide treasurer of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in U.S. deficits on a lasting basis.  \n',money-fx
'Commerce Dept. undersecretary of economic affairs Robert Ortner said that he believed the dollar at  current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies.     In a wide ranging address sponsored by the Export-Import Bank, Ortner, the bank\'s senior economist also said he believed that the yen was undervalued and could go up by 10 or 15 pct.     \"I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen,\" he said.     On the other hand, Ortner said that he thought that \"the yen is still a little bit undervalued,\" and \"could go up another 10 or 15 pct.\"     In addition, Ortner, who said he was speaking personally, said he thought that the dollar against most European currencies was \"fairly priced.\"     Ortner said his analysis of the various exchange rate values was based on such economic particulars as wage rate differentiations.     Ortner said there had been little impact on U.S. trade deficit by the decline of the dollar because at the time of the Plaza Accord, the dollar was extremely overvalued and that the first 15 pct decline had little impact.     He said there were indications now that the trade deficit was beginning to level off.     Turning to Brazil and Mexico, Ortner made it clear that it would be almost impossible for those countries to earn enough foreign exchange to pay the service on their debts.  He said the best way to deal with this was to use the policies outlined in Treasury Secretary James Baker\'s debt initiative.  \n',money-fx
'U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias as market participants focus on trends in the dollar, the economy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said.     Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains, that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will keep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months.     Until trends are clearer, \"the market can only attempt to to establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest rates,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.     Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy investment climate, the market will have no confidence in this environment until there is illumination of and confidence in U.S. Dollar/trade policy.     Salomon Brothers\' Henry Kaufman said the bond market, highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged if currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply.     \"The crucial question, however, is how soon either of these developments is likely to occur,\" Kaufman said.     \"Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while longer,\" said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving Securities Corp.     However, Braverman said that, \"from a longer term perspective, current (bond) prices provide a buying opportunity.\"     Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on unexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasury bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and Thursday\'s 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high.     Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism. Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday.     The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in a similar \"paroxysm of pessimism,\" the key bonds reached a similar closing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance, however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points.     Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach nine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely.     Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to persist over the next few months.     Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by midyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall.     \"Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we\'ve seen since the start of the year,\" Held said.     Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term.     \"The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance,\" said economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.     They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar and head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm the fragile U.S. Economic expansion.     The Lanston economists said, \"The Fed cannot ease its policy stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of causing a further decline in the dollar.\"     Minutes of February\'s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit markets warranted a policy shift.     However, economists generally believe that continued fairly sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S. Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing countries rule out any Fed policy firming.     There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at last Tuesday\'s meeting also left Fed policy unchanged.     This week\'s U.S. Economic data are expected to have little impact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on Wednesday, with March producer price data out Friday.     There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S. Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economic indicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A Friday rumor had put the number far higher. The index\'s first quarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNP growth of about three pct if continued through 1987.     Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open about there today with no Fed action seen.  \n',money-fx
'A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit market, but at least this week\'s offerings should provide it with some focus, economists said.     \"Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to work, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.     The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of two-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block this week.     The \"mini-refunding,\" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in new cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for auction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on Wednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on Thursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and six-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs.     The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly auspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy U.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar.     Moreover, the bond market\'s inertia has compared unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in high-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S. Equities.     But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a bit.     \"Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side, and there is a marked absence of selling,\" they said in a weekly report.     Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week\'s sales.     \"The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings. Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these maturities has been wider, it is still positive,\" he said in a weekly market review.     But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate enough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the overseas markets have had their run.     \"Based on last week\'s events, there is little to indicate that the appetite for yield has begun to wane,\" said economists at Salomon Brothers Inc.     Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan\'s new fiscal year on April 1.     And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week\'s U.S. Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence.     Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond markets, the Salomon Brothers\' economists said.     Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations, economists said.     This week\'s economic calendar begins on Tuesday with February durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from January\'s depressed levels.     Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said several areas, including transport equipment, should have bounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap total new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after January\'s 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain as large as five pct.     Friday\'s consumer price report for February is expected to show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain. Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the January rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food prices declined.     Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date.     Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the new statement period beginning on Thursday.     Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open near that level.  \n',money-fx
'Brisk increases in personal income and consumption are to appear in February data released today, but the bond market\'s recent sluggishness suggests there will be no major price reaction unless the rises are much larger than expected, economists said.     Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct, compared with no change in January, while consumption expenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct, reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January.     M-1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also be released. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected.         Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc expects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wage and salary disbursements in February.     Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, the average workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose by four cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durable goods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of at least 1.5 pct in consumption, he added.     The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond market much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slipping just 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct.     Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow range, desperately seeking direction.     \"Seasonally adjusted, it\'s already December in the bond market,\" quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.     Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said the steadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite some signs of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectations that inflation will remain subdued.     But he warned that this assumption might not be justified.     \"It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation was not returning to double digits, and now that it has learned that lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to five pct inflation is a real possibility ahead,\" Boltz said in a report.     After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct, Fed funds were indicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16, six pct.  \n',money-fx
'The U.S. credit market ended under extreme pressure as the dollar\'s continued slide on the currency markets triggered an avalanche of U.S. securities sales, pushing prices to 1987 lows, dealers and analysts said.     \"This was a bloodbath,\" said one money market economist. \"We\'ve been trading in a state of total panic at times today,\" said another.     Mirroring the dollar\'s fall to a 40-year low against the yen, the key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury bond price fell nearly two points to close at 96-7/32, compared with 98-5/32 on Friday. The corresponding yield jumped to 7.83 pct from 7.66.  \n',money-fx
'The complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says.     Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller, who joined the board last August.     He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the volatility of exchange rates.     Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.     His idea, which many conservative economists find appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan.     It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation, key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly.     Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base.     \"What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes,\" says Heller.     In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies.     A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.     The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early 1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.     But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the monetary system, is also being widely questioned.     Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also.     For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy.     Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement.     The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems.     Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration\'s chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters.    He appears convinced that officials from West Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing.    The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates.     As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis.     \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary policy might be eased,\" he says.     He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis.     Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and traded on a world-wide basis, so \"that an index has a relevance for the entire world,\" he says.     In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes.     \"Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures, the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions,\" he says.     However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.     He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities.  \n',money-fx
'U.S. authorities intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasion during the period between the start of November 1986 and the end of January, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report.     The Fed\'s quarterly review of foreign exchange operations said that the U.S. bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yen on January 28. This operation was coordinated with the Japanese monetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the U.S. Treasury.     The Fed\'s intervention was on the morning after president Reagan\'s State of the Union message and was \"in a manner consistent with the joint statement\" made by U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa after their January 21 consultations.     At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness to cooperate on exchange rate issues.     The Fed\'s report did not say at what level the intervention occurred. But on January 28, the dollar closed at 151.50/60 yen after dipping as low as 150.40 yen earlier in the session. It had closed at 151.05/15 yen the previous day.     The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 149.98 yen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 1.7675 marks on January 28. It ended that day at 1.7820/30 marks.     The Fed noted that, after trading steadily throughout November and the first half of December, the dollar moved sharply lower until the end of January.     It closed the three-month review period down more than 11 pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies and seven pct lower against the yen and sterling. It had fallen four pct against the Canadian dollar.     During the final days of January, pressure on the dollar subsided. Reports of the U.S.-Japanese intervention operation and talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrial countries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation on exchange rate and economic policy matters, the Fed said.     Moreover, doubts had developed about the course of U.S. interest rates. The dollar\'s swift fall had raised questions about whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease.     Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 1.8320 marks and 153.70 yen. According to the Fed\'s trade-weighted index, it had declined nine pct since the beginning of the period.     The dollar had risen as high as 2.08 marks and 165 yen in early November.     The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market on November 7, 1985 when it bought a total of 102.2 mln dlrs worth of marks and yen.     The Fed\'s action followed the September 1985 Plaza agreement between the five major industrial nations under which they agreed to promote an orderly decline of the dollar.  \n',money-fx
'A steep drop in goods-producing jobs detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar, economists said.     U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with February\'s 50,000 gain, while March construction employment dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February.     \"The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter,\" said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. \"This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters.\"     \"The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,\" he said. \"They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but clearly they can\'t tighten.\"     David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000 from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected.     While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S. gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct.     Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986.     \"There\'s momentum in first quarter labor force activity,  but less than assumed,\" he said. \"Gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed tightening for exchange-related purposes.\"     In March, the average workweek fell back to its January level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9 hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February.     The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and  electronic manufacturing.     Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a 13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs.     Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead.     Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter GNP accounts.     Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial activity \"is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP.\"     Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for March. They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income.     Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop in March construction employment may also signal a drop in March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851 million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in January.     The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which  fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February.     \"This just means that there were fewer people looking for work, so the drop in unemployment doesn\'t mean much,\" he said.     He said the latest employment report will not concern the Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of 2.5-3.0 pct, but \"it does suggest they can\'t afford to tighten to quickly either.\"     The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth.     Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their meeting this week. \"At some point they will be more inclined to ease,\" he said. For the time being, however, the March employment report \"increases the likelihood they won\'t tighten, regardless of the dollar.\"   \n',money-fx
'Thomas Berger, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, said that a further drop in the exchange value of the dollar could cause prices to go up and trigger inflation.     He told a meeting of the President\'s Export Council that the Japanese and the Germans have cut their profit margins to reflect recent drops in the dollar, so prices have remained much the same.     But he added that if the dollar dropped further there could be inflation in the United States.     Berger also said that a further devalued dollar may cause economic depressions in some U.S. trading partners, and that would not be in America\'s interest because it would close those markets to U.S. goods.  \n',money-fx
'The departure of James Baker\'s closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will not change the course of Washington\'s domestic and international economic policies, U.S. officials said.     Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation.     U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in shepherding President Reagan\'s sweeping tax reform plan through the U.S. Congress.     But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure, to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers, signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury Secretary himself might leave soon.     \"It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it came up,\" one official said.     Another commented, \"Baker will miss him, but he\'s not going to stand in his way.\"     There has been widespread speculation since last autumn that Darman sought a Wall Street job.     Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out.     Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed.     \"Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this administration over the past six years and his departure represents a substantial loss,\" he said.     U.S. Officials admitted Darman\'s absence would be an undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan\'s second term, at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as \"indispensable\" to Baker.     Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other nations as Baker\'s leading theorist on this issue, favouring target zones to limit currency fluctuations.     Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system.     But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives.     Baker\'s work as head of Reagan\'s Economic Policy Council, spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before.     Darman\'s strength was not as an economist, but as a political strategist \"and that\'s Baker\'s strength too,\" the official said.     There were already indications that Baker, who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor.     One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould, who holds the number three Treasury position of Under-Secretary.     Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years.     Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.     The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated.     He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement, when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain curbed the dollar\'s strength. The pact was a major turning point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets.     Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth.     These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between Japan and West Germany\'s trade surpluses and the United State\'s massive trade deficit.     That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman\'s departure.  \n',money-fx
'A Treasury Department spokesman refused comment on statements by Robert Ortner, undersecretary of economic affairs for the Commerce Department, that the Japanese yen was undervalued.     Ortner, senior economist at the Commerce Department, told an Export-Import Bank conference \"the yen is still a little bit undervalued,\" and \"could go up another 10 or 15 pct.\"     Asked for reaction, a Treasury spokesman said officials were aware of Ortner\'s comments but had no intention of making any comment on them.     Ortner, who stressed he was expressing personal views, said he thought the U.S. dollar was \"fairly priced\" against most European currencies and added \"I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen,\" he said.     But the yen should go up 10 or 15 pct in value, Ortner said, because it is undervalued against the dollar.

'The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said.     The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals agreed in January between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said.     It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals.     The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma.     \"On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively.\"      At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures.     In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the plans showed.     The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts.     They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S. And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national government agencies, the proposals showed.     The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges.     It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to \"net\" contracts -- consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream.     It recognised that \"such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation,\" and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account.

'A half point cut in base lending rates was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of downward pressure, dealers said.     During its routine intervention in the market, the bank trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing banks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct.     The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17.        For some time, fundamentals have led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow wholesale money market rates down.     Although political considerations -- the government\'s wish to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- had been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank\'s delaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling and perhaps about the market\'s reaction to the content of the Budget may have been behind the central bank\'s caution, dealers said.     In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut, leaving the market still looking for another half point fall.     Consequently, rates in the money market eased during the day, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to 10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at 10-5/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cd\'s were similarly down between 5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year.     Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated at around 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at the end of last week.

'Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive for world economic growth.     Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Volcker said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth in those countries was also decreasing.     \"In that kind of situation, further sizeable depreciation of the dollar could well be counterproductive,\" he said.     Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not been enough to offset the effects of slower exports, Volcker said.     On the value of the dollar, Volcker said he could not say whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in trade.     \"What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate adjustment has already been made,\" he said.     \"That adjustment should be large enough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the United States, to support the widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead,\" he said.     Volcker said U.S. exports were now growing substantially while import growth should slow.     Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with a minimum of inflationary pressure, the United States would have to slow its spending growth.     It would also have to achieve a better balance between investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to dispense with foreign capital.     \"The constructive way to work in the needed direction would be to reduce our budget deficit, year by year, paving the way for improvements in our trade accounts,\" he said.

'A world recession is unlikely this year as fiscal and monetary policy in most industrialized countries is supporting the economy, Deutsche Bank AG DBKG.F management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said.     But growth rates will be smaller than last year, with 1.5 to 2.5 pct likely in most industrialized countries, he told a news conference.     Herrhausen said he was confident private consumption would support economic growth in West Germany this year, with net income increases turning into purchasing power as long as inflation did not revive.     Herrhausen said he did not expect interest rates to rise in West Germany this year, but there was little room for further falls. Rates in the U.S. were however rising, as evidenced by the latest prime rate moves, but this rise would be moderate.     Herrhausen said he did not expect any major narrowing of the U.S. Trade and budget deficits in the next few months.     One success of the Paris agreement in February to foster currency stability was that U.S. Officials have stopped talking down the dollar, he noted.     The recent stability would last until markets decided to test the resolve of central banks, he said.     He noted that central banks had spent some 10 billion dlrs this week to stabilize the dollar against the yen in the first such test.     \"A massive attack on the mark, which could come if we get bad news out of the U.S., Would require a much higher intervention amount, raising the danger of inflation,\" he said.

To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen, Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means, including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said.     He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand.     \"We have to keep wages as low as possible,\" he said.     He also said the yen\'s large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports.     Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki said.     Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries, he said.

'\"Endaka,\" the strong yen, has usurped \"Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster\" as Japan\'s favourite horror story.     The yen\'s 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last two years has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon, the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15,000 dlrs a month.     But \"endaka,\" like many Japanese products, is for foreign consumption, locals and long-time foreign residents said.     \"It\'s not really that expensive. I don\'t pay attention to the cost of living,\" said Cheryl Richmond, a 25-year-old Canadian teacher of English in Tokyo.     Richmond said she earns 1,635 dlrs a month by \"chatting\" 40 hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the language. For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny, quiet two-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku, one of Tokyo\'s prime business and entertainment districts, and has managed to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month.     She spends less than 6.50 dlrs a day on food despite eating out once a day.     \"For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comes with soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet, pickles, miso soup, rice and tea,\" although she takes only coffee for breakfast and a sandwich for dinner.     No one argues that Tokyo is cheap, but long-time residents see no need to spend the 2,000 to 15,000 dlrs a month spent by foreign firms to house executives in Western-style homes.     The companies feel otherwise. They say they must pay the price to bring over the best people needed to back up their push into Japan\'s increasingly lucrative markets.     \"You can\'t expect people to move from New York or Sydney and trade down. It\'s not reasonable,\" said a spokesman for International Business Machines Corp (IBM), which supports Western lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo.     Tokyo is the world\'s most expensive city for business travellers, a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions Abroad said. It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on average more than 300 dlrs a day.     While the businessmen have little choice but to come here, many tourists, especially those from Europe, are opting to visit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia.     The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates \"endaka\" caused an 11.5 pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year.     Those who came tried to cut back on expenses, chiefly by curtailing shopping, it said.

'Responsibility for the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with those countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter     Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in those countries\' own long-term interest to raise the value of their currencies against the dollar.     Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S. could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits with Taiwain and Korea.     \"An undervalued currency will help those countries\' exports in the short term, but in the long run they have to be concerned about how they are perceived in the international business community,\" Yeutter said.

'Zambia will retain its foreign-exchange auction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since January 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said.     \"We have not run away from the auction. It hasn\'t been abolished at all,\" he tolds in an interview.     He said the system would be reintroduced after current talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds.     Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private bidders but not to fix the exchange rate.     Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the government\'s shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand.     It was suspended when the kwacha\'s rapid devaluation and strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible for the government and the private sector, he said.     Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months. In January 1987 the government was more than two months in arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha to the dollar.  \n',money-fx
'Zambia\'s talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an official newspaper said.     The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them.     President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots in which 15 people were killed.     The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost the government about 500 mln kwacha per year.     The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government\'s current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia\'s foreign exchange auction.     The central bank\'s weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January, pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate.     The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction system, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, since the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar.     Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency\'s devaluation once the auctions restart.     According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led by assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to conclude its talks with the government on schedule on March 23.

The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them.     President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots.     The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances.     The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government\'s current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia\'s foreign exchange auction.     The central bank\'s weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January, pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate.     The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months, but since the end of January has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar.     Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency\'s devaluation once the auctions restart.  \n',money-fx
'The Zambian currency further depreciated yesterday at the second auction since the introduction of a two-tier foreign exchange system last month.     The (central) Bank of Zambia said the kwacha was pegged at 16.99 to the dollar, compared to last week\"s rate of 15 to the dollar.     The bank, which offered six mln dlrs at the auction, reported demand for 13.4 mln dlrs. At the previous auction, the government offered eight mln dlrs.     Last month the government set a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha per dollar, subject to adjustment against a basket of five currencies, for certain official transactions.     It also introduced a new weekly foreign exchange auction only for parastatal organisations and the private sector, where the exchange rate is allowed to float in accordance with market demand.     The new auction system is designed to be more restrictive than the previous one, suspended in January after the central bank fell 10 weeks in arrears to successful bidders.     Under the new system, no bidder, except the the state oil company Zimoil and the national airline Zambia Airways, is allowed to bid for more than five pct of the foreign exchange on offer.  \n',money-fx
'Zambia will reintroduce a modified foreign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a new two-tier exchange rate, central bank governor Leonard Chivuno said.     Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions and a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other types of business.     The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine the kwacha\'s exchange rate, but these were suspended at the end of January.     President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had resulted.     Business and banking sources said another reason for suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful bidders.    The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system was first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15 per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later.     Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of about nine kwacha per dollar.  \n',money-fx
'Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\'s Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.     A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.     \"Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,\" Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. \"It was a very, very prudent fiscal budget.\"     Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a well-balanced budget within the confines of the government\'s philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.     Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.     As was widely expected, Lawson split his \"fiscal adjustment\" between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to 27 pct.     The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped.     Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately. Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full one-point cut tomorrow.     \"The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which it will have to reverse later,\" Jeffrey said, though he added a further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.     The main worry from today\'s speech is the outlook for inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.     Holt noted the \"rather loose\" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.     \"A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,\" he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation.     The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but it was \"not a good budget for inflation,\" he said     Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not too concerned about a revival of inflation.     Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the \"leading edge\" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front.     He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness.     Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.     Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from 1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets, which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said. that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast to be 4.0 billion stg.     But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election, which has to be held before June, 1988.     Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.     But others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it.     James Capel\'s Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent, Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no \"chickens coming home to roost.\"     Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.     Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost to the Conservative Party\'s pre-election popularity.  \n',interest
'British bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K. Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today\'s 1987 budget, bank analysts said.     The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\'s budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward.     Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through, the analysts said.     Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.     \"This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get interest rates down,\" he said.     Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half-point cut now.     Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he, too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday, but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.     \"This budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate. The implications for interest rates are very favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week,\" Simmonds said.     Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target. \"There is no real need to boost private consumption,\" he said.     National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.     Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully, in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point base rate cut could be implemented.  But providing the budget small-print was convincing, \"and I suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week,\" Kern said.     Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates. This would help achieve Lawson\'s lower than expected consumer price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.     U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money and government bonds (gilts) markets.     But building societies said they would not cut lending rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.  \n',interest
'Quarter-point prime rate increases to 7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the Federal Reserve\'s policy intentions, economists said.     \"Based on the spread between banks\' cost of funds and the prime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but no rush is likely,\" said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.     Citibank\'s surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by Chase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.     McCulley said that once the spread between three-month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than 1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.     However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near term, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to follow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example, the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount rate increase in April of that year.     Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since last August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the Fed\'s half-point discount rate cut to the current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.     \"The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2 pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.     Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today\'s meeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may well foster higher interest rates soon.     Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.     \"The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today\'s coupon pass,\" said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co.     In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for its own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a \"pass.\"     \"The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change,\" said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.      She said the spread between banks\' cost of funds and the prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153 basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate increase.     The Dean Witter economist said that today\'s prime rate rise \"may have been less a response to interest rates than an attempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line.\"     Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to developing countries, large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.     The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move.     In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of funds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly 6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.       The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five and 6-3/4 pct.     Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the 6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there, banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.     But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.  \n',interest
'The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd in New Zealand said it will raise its indicator lending rate to 23 pct from 21.5 pct on April 7.     A bank statement said the continuing rise in the cost of funds had to be passed on to the lending customers.     ANZ managing director Brian Weeks said: \"Recent developments in the money markets are of deep concern to all participants ... Market participants are understandably nervous and cautious about future developments.     These include flows to and from the government relating to the privatisation of seven government departments on April 1.     \"We welcome the flexibility evident in the Reserve Bank\'s move to raise the system cash target yesterday, but feel that to reduce the present nervousness the cash target and primary liquidity level need to be raised further...,\" he said.

'Calls for a cut in Austrian interest rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided over the issue.     Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half a percentage point in interest rates across the board. But Hannes Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein CABV.VI tolds he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.     Vak told a news conference that last January\'s cut in lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors by a quarter point had been insufficient.     The January cut followed the National Bank\'s lowering of its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct.     Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.     Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth this year also justified a further interest drop, he said.     Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called for lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small, particularly when compared with other West European countries.     But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse-Bank tolds that no cut should be made unless West German rates came down first.     Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming opposition from Creditanstalt, Austria\'s biggest bank.  \n',interest

The Bank of England\'s announcement was quickly followed by Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank which announced a half-point cut in their base rates to 10 pct from 10-1/2 pct.     Dealers said the lowering in base rates had been widely expected following yesterday\'s U.K. Budget in which Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced a three billion stg cut in the Government\'s public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 to four billion stg.

The Bank\'s announcement this morning that it was willing to lend two-week money at 10 pct was interpreted by the market as a sanction for lower U.K. Base lending rates.

'This week\'s Bank of England resistance to strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in holding bank base rates at 11 pct.     But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\'s policy, stated at the end of the Paris Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources said.     Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day.     Today\'s peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.     A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.     Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. \"Even after this action over the last few weeks, sterling\'s only just within striking distance of that range,\" he said.     Other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area.     However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.     \"If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they are, what\'s to stop it (going higher),\" said John Cox, executive director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London foreign exchange market.     Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped keep it below 1.60 dlrs.     The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and 1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.     But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels.     He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat. \"If rates don\'t come down, the market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling,\" he said.     Most dealers agree there is a good deal of \"hot money\" being invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short notice.     However, the authorities will hope that at least a proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.     \"The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and have to jack them back up again,\" said Richard Jeffrey, economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.     He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling, at least in the near term.     However, most analysts are still looking for a full point about March 17, Budget Day.     The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the Budget, said Temperton.     The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current bullishness in the government bond and currency markets.     \"Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget. He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut,\" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the equities arm of Mercury International Group.     Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.     This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11 3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.     However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut as a guide to the Bank\'s intentions on short term rates.  \n',interest
'The Bank of England again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.     It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.     Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want to.     The Bank\'s latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage.     \"They\'re really making the discount houses suffer,\" said Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew. \"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.\"     This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came strongly into the pound.     The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50.     \"If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget,\" said Jeremy Hale, economist at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.     Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.     However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains.     There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.     Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, Fellner said.     An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most forecasts say it will be this year.     Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.     However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.     The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.     Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.     They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington.     The Bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. \"But by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of England,\" he added.     The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders.     Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front, today\'s figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.     This was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.     Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.     The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half or full point about Budget day.  \n',interest

He said higher rates were fuelling an influx of short-term speculative capital from abroad.     \"At least 800 mln dlrs of current excess liquidity in the system is convertible pesetas from West Germany and other countries with much lower rates,\" he said.  \n',interest

'Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain\'s decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks, saying it reflected the socialist government\'s determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.     The central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.     Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth.     \"I think it\'s a good measure,\" a senior foreign banker said. \"It\'s a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy.\"     \"It shows that the political will is very strong. They know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run,\" he added.     The head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates.     But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish exports less competitive.     The government says industry\'s competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was way above that of Spain\'s major trading partners in the European Community, which it joined a year ago.     To help meet this year\'s target of five pct, it is insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough sacrifices.     Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose demands essentially involve more government spending, have become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.     Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard.     The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at today\'s auction. The rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.     Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.     The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the publication of the decree in today\'s official gazette. Bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and, inevitably, push lending rates higher.     A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates.  \n',interest

'The Belgian National Bank cut interest rates on one, two and three-month treasury certificates to 7.30 pct from 7.40 pct effective immediately, the bank said in a telex message.     The Bank last adjusted its short-term treasury certificate rates on March 23, when it also reduced rates for all three periods by 0.10 points.     A National Bank spokesman said the latest adjustment would bring the rates closer in line with currently prevailing interbank interest rates.     The spokesman said it was too early to predict whether the move would herald a reduction in discount rate, which currently stands at eight pct, when the Bank holds its regular weekly meeting at which the rate is discussed next Wednesday.     The discount rate generally moves in tandem with the three-month treasury certificate rate. However, there is no formal link and the discount rate was not adjusted following the March 23 changes.  \n',interest
'Brazil\'s central bank governor Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country\'s unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said.     Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head of Brazil\'s bank advisory committee, and of co-heads Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc.     High on the agenda will be banks\' complaints about Brazil\'s accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines, the bankers said.     Brazil\'s several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed last March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, as part of a 31 billion dlr financing package.     Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled with Brazil\'s freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros.     They said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another.     The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower interest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would rather accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the central bank.     \"It\'s caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,\" one banker said.     Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of a 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance minister Dilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support for Brazil\'s debt stance.  \n',interest
'The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.5 billion marks at today\'s tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said.     Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy back securities pledged on April 22.     The allocation was in line with market expectations the Bundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks draining from this week as an earlier facility expires.     Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from 3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said.     The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving the system which the Bundesbank added last week via government-owned banks.     However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers drew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity.     The call money declines surprised some dealers, who speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further government funds today. However, most said this had not occurred.     Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billion marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from 49.9 billion on Thursday. Average daily reserves over the first 20 days of the month fell to 52.6 billion from 53.1 billion.

The bank said it was also halving its yearly Visa card user fee to six dlrs, but would retain its 15 ct fee for each transaction.     A bank spokesman said the previously reported call by the Canadian Parliament\'s finance committee on March 20 for a substantial cut in credit card rates \"was a factor\" in the move, but he would not elaborate.     Canada\'s minister of state for finance Thomas Hockin had threatened legislation to reduce the rates, which apply to unpaid balances, if the financial institutions did not voluntarily act.     The Canadian Imperial Bank spokesman said \"the bank card market is a very competitive one and we have to move to stay competitive.\"     Canadian Imperial\'s new rates match those of Toronto Dominion Bank, which lowered its rates before the finance committee report.     Canadian Imperial Bank added that cardholders will be allowed to choose between the 15 ct transaction fee or the six dlr yearly card fee.

'The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank\'s loans and other assets.     Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England.     The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.     The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments.     Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain.     Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank\'s minimum capital needs.     The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank\'s current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.     The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the replacement cost.     Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset.     The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity.     They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.     Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks, which are the principal participants in these types of activities.     They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to compete in world financial markets.     However, the staff concluded, \"The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations.\"     The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.     Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges.     Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules.  \n',interest
'The Federal Reserve is expected to enter the U.S. government securities market to add reserves during its usual intervention period today, economists said.

'U.S. February reports reflecting slim gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said.     \"If you\'re the Fed, there\'s no reason to do anything,\" said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc.     \"There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflation front, all is well,\" he said. \"Money supply is well under control. It\'s an absolutely ideal situation.\"     February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected. This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January\'s production number, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.     The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct, less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct rise in the PPI in January.     \"The Fed is going to look at this positively,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation. \"Certainly inflation is not as bad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants.\"     The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in February, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.     \"This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel,\" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. \"The trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year.\"     In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct decline in the PPI.     Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected, but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.     Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the Federal Reserve.     \"The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.     While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar.     \"The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,\" he said. \"We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with foreign producers.\"     Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct in February\'s PPI. With many electronic goods produced overseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.     If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish overseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.     By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.     Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers\' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire, and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar.     David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S. industrial output.     \"It\'s the other side of the lower dollar,\" Wyss said. \"Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output.\"     Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter. \"It\'s an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive.\"     But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not  convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output.     Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production.     Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2 pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.     Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5 million units.     \"In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are producing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate,\" Roach said. \"The disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories.\"     Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987.     January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain since July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce Department said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the largest monthly sales drop on record.     Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to month-to-month changes. \"The Fed has been standing pat for the last seven months,\" Ramirez said. \"They will continue to stand pat for at least the next couple of months.\"  \n',interest

'The Federal Reserve\'s move to easier monetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount rate cuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in the second quarter, analysts said.     A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to edge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate from 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy.     \"The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without a full-blown recession,\" said Raymond Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.     Stone said economic data available by late June may be just weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he said it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half point, to avoid hurting the dollar further.     All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.     The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury bond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.     Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to the April-June quarter, follow:     - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further against other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget deficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after the dollar\'s steep drop in the last two business days, the economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that the dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.     - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well test the lower end of that range.     - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and probably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.     - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.     - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct annual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first and second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct annual rate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.     Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among those surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct rate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.     \"The economy will bounce back more strongly than many expect,\" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in inventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter economic growth, with consumer spending helping later.     \"We\'re running out of special factors to keep the economy afloat,\" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.     Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively. He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second quarter growth could be zero or negative.     Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer from a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow  government spending and less construction. Only a marginally narrower trade deficit will add to growth.     He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds, with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct, respectively. Nikko\'s Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for bonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.     Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly after the dollar\'s fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past days and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.     David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20 pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.     Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point to eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.     The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese investors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S. trade sanctions. Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers. ......END-JUNE U.S. INTEREST RATE FORECASTS.... ....................T-bonds..Fed funds..Prime.. Nikko Securities.....8.25......6.15......7.75..

'The French primary bond market is showing signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said.     The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5.     The central bank\'s averaged-out day to day call money rate, the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this week, dealers noted.     The Bank of France\'s \"open market\" policy to regulate the money markets since December has been based on a floor and ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and seven day repurchase rates.     For the moment the sentiment is of \"wait and see\" on rate cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said.     Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond market, noting that this week\'s monthly Treasury tap issue of 11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily absorbed.     The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12 billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said.     Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity in the primary market at the moment despite competition from the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange.     There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand - with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees.     Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d\'Aide a l\'Equipement des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March 9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct.     Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said.     Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest focussed on the likely three next issues.     These will include an expected four to five billion franc issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de Refinancement Hypothecaire.  \n',interest
'After an already steep fall in the past week, U.S. interest rate futures may be in for further declines in the near term, financial analysts said.     However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and the contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before resuming their decline.     Key to the near-term direction of futures will be the course of the dollar, they said.     \"As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market,\" said Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs.     The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year low against the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday when several large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised their prime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct.     \"Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar, foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline is over,\" Gibbs said.     The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation.     Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the meeting of the Federal Reserve\'s policy making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, this week, analysts said.     \"To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, a steepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices look suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating inflation,\" said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEntee and McGinley Inc.     Such expectations could mean that \"a shift in policy toward restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious consideration,\" at the FOMC meeting, he said.     Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly visible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said.     Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found in seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, he said. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln dlrs over the past several months, he said.     In the meantime, however, \"the market looks a bit oversold,\" said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures.     Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could drive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test chart support near the recent low of 97-13/32.     Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston said that the key test for June bonds will be whether the nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32.     \"All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped and buyers have surfaced at that level,\" Keefe said.     If that level is broken, and the dollar continues to decline, Keefe said she expects the June bond contract to decline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrend line dating back to 1984.  \n',interest
'Debt among African countries will continue to grow and their economies remain stifled unless developed countries lower their interest rates, Nigerian Trade Minister Samaila Mamman said.     He told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting the widening gap between developed and developing countries and an inequitable international economic system were major impediments to growth in developing countries.     Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks in the New Zealand resort of Taupo.     \"I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of the external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the developed market economy countries,\" Mamman said.     \"The developed market economy countries have slowed down output growth thereby drying up markets for the commodity exports of African countries.\"     Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs a year would be needed over the next five years for the African continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth (GDP) rate of three to four pct by 1990.     Yet at the same time Africa\'s debt service was estimated at 24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990.     \"With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three to four pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debt persists,\" Mamman said. Developed countries must seek alternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer of resources and more indebtedness, he said.     \"The international community cannot fail to respond positively to the collapse of the international market for commodities ... And act quickly to stabilize demand and prices of our commodity exports,\" he added.  \n',interest
'The Association of German Cooperative Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates would continue to remain low for the time being.     It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong foreign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in the economy that could affect the long-term capital market.     The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year\'s end and next year, it said.     The association said generally low interest rates, prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure growth.     The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest rates down on the short-term money market although its policies had exerted little effect on the long-term capital market, which was so important for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy, it said.     In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had in influencing the longer-term capital market, the association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy through a short-term and expansionist monetary policy.     On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.     The association said time would show to what extent speculative foreign money and short-term invested domestic money would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbank could hold down money market rates with the highly effective instrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said.  \n',interest
'West German bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates, as seen in last month\'s Paris pact, extend to keeping down European interest rates, banking economists said.     But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate West Germany\'s economy, they said.     The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention, economists said.     Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April. \"The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate are significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S. and foreign interest rates,\" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent study.     It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar\'s fall. These spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.     West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged the U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid weakening the dollar.     West German economists see room for further cuts in leading West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.     \"It\'s not a taboo,\" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank AG said.     But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates only in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.     The Bundesbank\'s average yield of public paper is already nearing last year\'s low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50 pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April.  Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate.     It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the Bundesbank\'s central bank money stock aggregate.     But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West German tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to meet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing.     This may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.     Economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.     Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German Ifo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the West German government in November.     Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up. But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar\'s decline, long term yields may to have to rise, economists said.     Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of Bonn\'s tax reform package.     The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.     West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.     Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as raising indirect taxes.     But few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing.     The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits.     The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed a large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.     The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.  \n',interest
'Increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds higher this year, bond market sources say.     \"At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners,\" one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in Frankfurt said.     The sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.     Friday\'s loan stock was the third this year already, the sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.     This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.     But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors, and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.     Sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last May.     One finance ministry economist said \"It isn\'t more. It\'s just the size (of each bond) which has increased.\" He added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt.     Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad, with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.     With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however, foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.     Sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.     The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26.6 billion.     The sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form.     Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including the government\'s tax reduction program, would also reduce income next year. \"The problem here will be the tax reform,\" the portfolio manager said.     He added that the government\'s cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings.     The sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other.     The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the issue of fixed-rate medium-term \"Kassenobligation\" notes.     A finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net 22.3 billion marks this year.     Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect.     \"I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase,\" the manager said.     Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with the Bundesbank\'s public authority bond yield calculation falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.     But sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark.     \"The demand wasn\'t so good,\" a dealer for a German bank in London said.     The dollar\'s recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently, some dealers said.  \n',interest

'Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks yesterday, dealers said.     They tolds local banks may decide on the increase at this weekend\'s routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of Banks.     G.C.

'The Belgian government, which introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year, has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is scope for further cuts in 1988.     The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.     The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.     The team\'s report to the government praises last year\'s spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy perform \"better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in the 1980s.\"     However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the government has set itself for 1989.     The government\'s net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of GNP in 1986.     The report says \"The most that can be afforded over the next few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of general Government.\"     It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the debt to GNP ratio before this is possible.     \"Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions, we feel that your position would be stronger if you could decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988,\" the report adds.     The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the government\'s determination to keep its currency strong and to curb inflation.     It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.     It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in Belgian francs.  \n',interest
'The Indian Finance Ministry\'s announcement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation\'s interest rate structure, will benefit industry and agriculture by providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said.     The changes, effective today, included reducing commercial bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pct by one percentage point.     New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, also include a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, on deposits of two years or more but less than five.     Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct interest have been abolished.     Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the government\'s concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help improve world competitiveness of Indian goods.     There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits by long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create the flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity shares or short-term bank deposits, they said.

'A tight money market has pushed interest rates on three to six month time deposits to between 15 and 18 pct from 13 to 15 pct a month ago, bankers said.     March is usually a tight month for the money market because of tax payments and banks\' need to attract funds for their year-end accounts on March 31.     This year the situation has been made worse by December\'s rush to buy dollars by companies and businessmen who feared imposition of exchange controls. Much of that outflow has yet to be converted back into rupiah.     \"A lot of small money has come back in, but the big money is holding out until after April,\" one U.S. Banker said.     The tight money policy of Bank Indonesia, the central bank, is helping to keep rates high.

Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar said earlier this week that Indonesia could look forward to better economic prospects in 1987/88, but added the \"speculators\" who led a run on the rupiah late last year could again pose problems.

'Japan is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris, Finance Ministry sources said.

The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank, People\'s Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.     However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut, to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.

On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28. The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.     These ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau\'s deposit rate, the ministry sources said.     Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1 percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.  \n',interest
'Japan\'s long-term banks will soon cut their prime rate, now at a record low 5.5 pct, by 0.2 or 0.3 percentage point in response to falling secondary market yields on their five-year debentures, long-term bankers said.     The long-term prime rate is customarily set 0.9 percentage point above the coupon on five-year bank debentures issued by the long-term banks every month.     The latest bank debentures, at 4.6 pct, have met strong end-investor demand on the prospect of further declines in yen interest rates, dealers said. The current 5.5 pct prime rate has been in effect since February 28.  \n',interest
'The Bank of Japan decided at a policy board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money market certificates (MMCs), a central bank official said.     The new guideline will go into effect on April 6, the bank said.     Under the guideline, the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen from 300 mln.     The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of between one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentage point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, the bank said.     But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or less will remain the same, or 0.75 percentage point below the CD rates.     The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mln yen from 30 mln.     The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by 0.37 point, effective March 16, in line with the half-point cut in the official discount rate on February 23.     New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at banks, for example, will be 3.64 pct and 3.39 pct per annum, respectively.     Demand deposit rates, however, will remain the same.  \n',interest
'U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he expected British interest rates to fall soon in response to his fiscal 1987/88 budget, but he did not say by how much.     \"I would be very surprised if there is not a very early further fall in interest rates,\" Lawson said in a radio interview.     Analysts said they foresaw U.K. Base rates falling as early as today by as much as one full percentage point after Lawson\'s announcement yesterday that the public sector borrowing requirement in fiscal 1987/88 and 1988/89 was to fall to 1.0 pct of GDP, or some four billion stg.

'Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\'s remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling, dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analysts said.     But the market\'s reaction, testing exchange rate levels indicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed.     In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy, Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.     Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about present levels, using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this.     The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges, but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these.     Markets were quick to react to the statement, chopping about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by Lawson.     But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson\'s statement signalled a change in U.K. Policy.     Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said, \"the remarks have been blown out of proportion. Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue.\"     Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, \"there is nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor\'s statement.\"     He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the Chancellor were precise targets, but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate, perhaps by as much as 10 pct.     \"It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election ... I don\'t believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate,\" Brett said.     Currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency trading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said.     \"Making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake,\" one senior dealer with a U.S. Bank said.     Capel\'s Skeoch said, \"it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at.\"     \"It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group of Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in stone, they can change with time,\" Skeoch said.     Brett said, \"we think the 2.90 marks level is a central rate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine.\"     Not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar.     Although about two-thirds of Britain\'s trade is conducted with European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.     \"Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or throw in its lot with Europe,\" Dunn said.     \"It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to join the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by shadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark,\" he said.     Analysts said sterling\'s dip on currency markets following Lawson\'s remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.     \"Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some extremely good economic indicators,\" Capel\'s Skeoch said.     Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March, the last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards.  \n',interest

'U.K. Interest rates look set to move lower even after Monday\'s half-point cut in bank base rates to 10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension of a British National Savings issue yesterday.     The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury Department unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched in October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the market.     The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, the second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted.     They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts issue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct downpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than later.     The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due 1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward pressure on money market rates remained intact, with the bellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at 10-9-7/8 pct.      It coincided with another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar.     \"That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed,\" said Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew; \"It is an indication that the market believes rates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point immediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people hope for more.\"     Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the National Savings Department was \"of considerable significance.\"     It said, \"the real message ... Is that the decks are being quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises.\"     Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a reduction in mortgage lending rates.     Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut.     \"National Savings has been competing too effectively with the building societies of late. Building society income has been depressed in recent months,\" he said.     He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid on U.K. Inflation.     Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after last year\'s 3.7 pct.     Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct.     But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been complaining to the government about intense competition from National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early mortgage rate cuts.     \"The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the building societies\' criticism to heart. It looks like the National Savings move reflects this,\" one senior dealer said.     A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with the rest of the market.     \"We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just becoming too expensive and we don\'t need all that money,\" he tolds, adding the department had suspended issues at least twice in the past, when offered interest rates were above or below market rates.     He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as U.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31.     In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving\'s contribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg, compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the previous year, official figures show.     Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the total for 11 months above target, government officials said.  \n',interest

'U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said.     After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk.     Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals.     Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals.     \"What they are proposing is really double counting,\" Patrick de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.     \"The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected,\" said a director at one U.K. merchant bank. \"What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now -- to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now,\" he added.(Adds title first paragraph).     Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers.     Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules.      Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is, offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other.     The paper said that regulatory authorities \"recognize that such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk.\" Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.     But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.      \"One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market. So we don\'t know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court,\" said one bank official.  \n',interest
'The new interest rate of 7/8 pct over Libor on Venezuelan public sector debt payments goes into effect today, Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua said .     Azpurua told reporters yesterday the reduction from the previous margin of 1-1/8 pct above Libor will save the country some 50 mln dollars in debt servicing.     The new rate is among changes agreed last month to the 20.3 billion dlr public sector debt rescheduling. Under the new agreement, Venezula was also able to extend the term from 12 to 14 years and to lower debt payments in the 1987-89 period by 64 pct.

'The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.     Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow\'s tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system.     The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon.     Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender.     Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week\'s pact to keep short-term rates down.     But because of uncertainty about banks\' current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week\'s tender.     \"I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,\" one dealer said.     \"They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer,\" he added.     An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.     Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

'Philippine government revenue is expected to rise 26 pct to 99.9 billion pesos this year from 79.1 billion in 1986, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.     In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department\'s performance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin said at least 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax reform measures announced last year.     He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA) this year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors have committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pct from 1.3 billion in 1986.     Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base included a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in 1988. He gave no other details.     He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels and the volume of government securities sold to the private sector have improved significantly. \"In particular, short-term prime interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now down to less than 10 pct,\" he said.     Ongpin said the government\'s debt-equity scheme, introduced in August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth of applications, but selective evaluation had resulted in approvals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February.     He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation program and the sale of non-performing assets owned by associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a 1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help finance land reform.     Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed companies will be used to finance the land reform plan.

'Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut leading interest rates again if the United States makes a similar move, banking sources said.     The sources were reporting Poehl\'s remarks at a symposium in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press representatives were not invited.     The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200 bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates would give room for a matching measure in Germany.     \"It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates,\" said one banker who attended the symposium.     A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no comment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting.     But, according to a second source, who also declined to be identified, Poehl\'s comments were seen by bankers present as a direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.     \"He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,\" the second source said.     In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cut in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such a move in advance, the sources said.     Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, by cuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early as last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying, \"No, they wouldn\'t have been. We checked that.\"     The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates.     Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, saying that financial markets had not fully realised the significance of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further falls in the value of the dollar, the sources said.     For the first time all participants at the summit agreed that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all world economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said.     The sources said the tone of Poehl\'s comments boosted growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around current levels by international central bank cooperation.     One source said Poehl\'s remarks also underlined the fact that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in West Germany\'s economic growth.     Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past stressed that the German central bank had no direct responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with combatting inflation.     This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter monetary stance from the beginning of December until the half-point cut in rates in late January.     The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react immediately whenever such overshooting occurs.     Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank\'s main measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at 7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target.     Share prices rose in very active trading today, with dealers reporting that Poehl\'s remarks, coupled with a bullish outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium, brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels.  \n',interest
'Higher oil prices and stronger than expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S. interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive chart outlook, financial analysts said.     The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment during February was above market expectations for a rise of 170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond futures that drove the June contract through key technical support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.     \"I don\'t like that fact that we had a close below 101,\" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday led to bullish forecasts by chartists.     But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday.     Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32 may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep losses.     \"I tend to go along with the double top scenario,\" said Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico.     Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals.     Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week.     The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner\'s expectation that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on an improving inflation outlook.     With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, \"the inflation outlook is improving,\" Leiner said, and that should lead to relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar prices.     Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices remains a concern for the inflation outlook.     Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday.     \"The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,\" said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer.     The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely \"media induced,\" Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC production may be within quotas, \"oil stocks are at tremendously high levels.\"     Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.  \n',interest
'Two new eurosterling bonds were launched today, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this month, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria.     The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in banks\' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said this had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments.     \"Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month and we\'re set to see many more eurosterling deals,\" one dealer said.     Today\'s new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year, 100 mln stg deal for Sweden at 9-1/2 pct and priced at 101-1/4 pct, lead by Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd. \"We thought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 we had last month but it seems March will beat February hands down with 10 already,\" one eurosterling specialist said.     \"Optically, psychologically, these single figures are much more attractive for the borrower. Eurosterling looks like a cheap and attractive way to raise your money,\" he added.     This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have tapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as the Kingdom of Sweden today, continental banks including Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations.     Another U.K. Merchant bank analyst noted that the current vogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers last month to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields.

'The Bundesbank should take further steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring long-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG CBKG.F management board chairman Walter Seipp said.     But he told the bank\'s annual news conference this did not mean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction in money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements.     \"Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates,\" he said. \"The money market rates are the important ones.\"     Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating money market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent tender allocations.     An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary growth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware of the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital formation, braking the expansion of money supply.     \"Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of monetary growth both at the same time,\" he added.     Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a picture of the German economy, since company profitability had improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark.     Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said, describing the downturn in production in the first months as a false start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year.     After an economic contraction in the first quarter, the economy should show an uptrend in the last three. \"We don\'t believe that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a \'growth dip,\'\" Seipp said.     But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal policy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should be brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct.     The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January were no substitute for support for growth.     Seipp added the federal government should make \"further courageous steps to decrease the state\'s proportion of the German economy and to increase its flexibility.\"  \n',interest
'Spain\'s Finance Ministry deregulated bank deposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks and bring legislation into line with the European Community (EC), a ministry spokesman said.     The measure was published today in the Official State Gazette. It takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on rates, now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days.     The government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct from 13 pct the proportion of total assets which banks must lend at favourable rates to industries classified \"of public interest.\"     Some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in a 20 pct drop in profits this year.     Secretary of State for the Economy Guillermo de la Dehesa tolds in a recent interview the reduction in fixed asset investments would offset losses from the rate liberalisation.  \n',interest

'Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit.     \"The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy,\" he told a press conference.     His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days.     At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus.     Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable.     He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening market activity, he added.  \n',interest

'Officials of five Thai commercial banks are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting interest rates, banking sources said.     They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity on the money market.     Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending rates, they said.     Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and overdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16 but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, the sources said.     Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The current gross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit and the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade.     Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about 40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created problems for many banks in managing their money effectively.     Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth. The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion in bank deposits.     Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have further buoyed the Thai stock market this week.     The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up 4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02.     Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market.     Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of bank capital.     If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry date, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct.     Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht of surplus funds to the local money market.  \n',interest

'U.S. economic data due out next week is unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said.     \"People don\'t seem to have any firm conviction about the current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve doing anything,\" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman Mains.     The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading volume, he noted. \"We\'ve had a decline in activity as recent economic statistics have not greatly changed people\'s viewpoints on interest rates,\" Mains said.     The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange markets after the Paris initiative has made for \"less than ebullient market action,\" Mains said.     He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the top of the trading range.     \"My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and market participants will see that current prices are unjustified,\" Mains said.     Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks retail interest. \"All of the movement occurs at the opening,\" afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said.     Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond prices, the small rise in February producer prices and downward revisions in January retail sales and industrial production were \"not real exciting,\" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner.     \"There is no one factor that will push us through the highs at this moment,\" Leiner said.     Next week\'s revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market, said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan. Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the direction of bond prices over the next month.     Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed the largest increase since 1979.     \"The key question will be not whether there is a large increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is sustainable or a one shot deal,\" Kahan said.     He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on second quarter growth.     If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could ease back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said.  \n',interest

'Two major U.K. Clearing banks announced they will offer a total of 800 mln stg in new mortgages at a fixed interest rate of 10.2 pct for the first three years, below current bank base lending rates of 10.5 pct.     Midland Bank Plc MDBL.L said it has initially allocated 500 mln stg for home loans at this rate, while Lloyds Bank Plc LLOY.L will offer 300 mln stg.     Earlier this week, Midland said it would cut its standard rate of mortgage payment to 11.5 pct from April 1, following a half a percentage point reduction in leading banks\' base lending rates from 11 pct.     Building society and other bank mortgage rates are largely still well above the new base rate level, although last year Lloyds offered a fixed rate of 9.9 pct on certain home loans.

'Today\'s modest half-point cut in U.K. Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England\'s determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said.     They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2 pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant.     Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates after yesterday\'s budget set a sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg.     Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading.     Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year.     But today\'s smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt.     Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates.     \"Today\'s cut was slightly disappointing,\" said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. \"The Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper the markets\' first rush of blood to the head after the budget.\"     Analysts said the bank\'s move today to lend two-week cash to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time.     The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term.     Sharp rises in the pound\'s value could be checked initially through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again.     \"The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being,\" said Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds. \"But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long.\"     Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday.     Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said \"There is another half point to come in the near term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks.\"     Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling\'s exchange rate.     Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately.     Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances of re-election for the Conservative government and probably advanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988. Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated assets, pushing the pound\'s value well above unofficial targets.     With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase\'s Marshall said \"Sterling is simply the best game in town, especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong.\"  \n',interest
'The Bank of England said it was taking onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 \"B.\"  A further 100 mln stg was reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.     The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank\'s announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20 minutes after the news.     Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling\'s strength.     The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct.     The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March 17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\'s package of measures.     However, in the face of sterling\'s apparently inexorable climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half-point cut.     Today\'s one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.     Most market participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget, although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage.     Dealers noted that as part of the authorities\' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond market.     To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains.     Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week\'s.     However, they noted that although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday\'s final 71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300 GMT.  \n',interest

'The prospect that other banks will follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit markets today, economists said.     Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days of heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by announcing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4 pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.     Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar - the market\'s overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the news.     Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.     Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this week, is already tightening its grip on credit.     \"The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the banking system\'s reserve needs this statement period, but I wouldn\'t conclude anything until I\'ve seen the Fed data,\" said Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank. ^M \n',interest
'U.S. economic data this week could be the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.     Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be positive for the market, the analysts said.     \"You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds right now,\" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane.     Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest to break below chart support in the June contract failed to materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early quickly covered short positions, they said.     \"Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in as expected it won\'t be that bad for the market,\" Sloane said.     Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.     Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up 0.8 to 1.2 pct.     Industrial production and the producer price index Friday both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she added.     Retail sales \"will tell us whether or not we will be able to fill the gap,\" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds closed at 100-4/32 today.     Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.     \"A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the market approached the top of the range,\" Singer said.     In order for bonds to break above the top of the range, which is just below 102 in the June contract, \"the crude oil rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,\" Singer said. \"Fed funds are already easing back down toward the six pct level.\"     The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.     Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to ease to 99-6/32 and find support.     \"I\'m not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.

'The U.S. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy, a Reagan administration official said.     The official\'s comments also suggest that debtors\' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms.     In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a \"megabank,\" where Third World debt would be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the same time, however, the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground.     The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine suggestions that \"exit bonds\" be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan, the official said in an interview withs.     \"All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered,\" said the official, who asked not to be named.     In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.     In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth.     \"The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors have been performing well,\" said the official. But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an exception.     The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker, also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis.     \"We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively,\" the official said.     Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that commercial banks create a \"megabank\" which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called \"exit bonds\" for banks like regional American or European institutions.     Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs.     He emphasised that the \"megabank\" was not an administration plan but \"something some people have suggested.\"     Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would differ slightly from the one the official described.     But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States.     \"If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go, fine. I don\'t think they ever will.\"     He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution.     Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct above Libor.     \"The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it\'s quite unique and I don\'t think it\'s something that should be categorically rejected out of hand,\" the official said.     Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes.     These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point over Libor.     Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt.     But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the banks. \"It\'s no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before,\" the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek. \"Some people argue that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money,\" he added.     He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines\'.  \n',interest

'Financial analysts see little chance that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week.     \"We got a little volatility Wednesday,\" said Staley Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. \"But for the moment we\'re still in a trading range.\"     Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its sluggish state, the analysts said.     \"It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low volatility,\" said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. \"It needs something, but it\'s not going to be news about the economy,\" he said.     Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy.     But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said.     In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace.     \"The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1,\" Quinn said.     Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of Japan\'s fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond market, he said.     \"We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct,\" compared to the current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.     In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not likely to move futures.     The Treasury\'s announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding operation did little to move cash government securities prices late Wednesday after the close of futures.     \"I\'d be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (the trading range),\" Lacey said.  \n',interest

'West German commercial banks are cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking sources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the usual interim period.     A Deutsche Bank AG DBKG.F spokesman said it is cutting leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis by 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG DRSD.F and Commerzbank AG CBKG.F have initiated similar moves. Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG BKFG.F cut rates 0.5 pct generally.     The delay was partly due to commercial banks\' desire to gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings banks.     A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one economist at the German Banking Association said.     But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest them at higher yields in the future, he said.     He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money supply aggregate.     The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5 pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year, unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the expanded target range of three to six pct.     Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private customers, though lending rates for corporate customers are beginning to decline.  \n',interest

'The World Bank intends to bring borrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it expects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bank vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said.     He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan, West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. \"The weight of opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higher probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower interest rates,\" he said.     The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates.     The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where and how much to borrow, Rotberg said.     Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years\' anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years.     Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, it did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the sake of innovation, Rotberg said.     Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only some eight billion had been swapped into another currency.     Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident that this was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.     The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over the next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However, for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new instruments such as bonds with warrants.     The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany since the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.  \n',interest

'A senior Ivory Coast Agriculture Ministry official confirmed his country\'s backing for a new international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week.     The official tolds that Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks, convened by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), in London on Monday.     While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeral ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, scheduled to be held in the country\'s capital Yamoussoukro between March 19-22, senior Ivorian delegates will be present throughout the London talks, the official said.     Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours that he or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public mourning in the West African nation helped depress already low world cocoa prices Friday.     The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the new pact, which was agreed in principle last year by most of the world\'s cocoa exporters and consumers.     He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCO Council chairman during the talks, scheduled to end on March 27.     The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the pact\'s buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market hit by successive world cocoa surpluses.     Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices.  \n',25
'Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.     The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.     Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures.     Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors.     There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.     In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.     Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.     Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.     New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB.     Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.     April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.     Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports.     Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec.     Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas.     Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.     Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop.

'The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) council agreed standard price differentials for different origin cocoas to form part of the buffer stock buying and selling procedure, consumer delegates said.     The buffer stock manager will accept offers for different origin cocoas according to a sliding scale of price differentials, under which Ghana cocoa will be pegged at a 137 stg premium to Malaysian.     Thus, if the buffer stock manager was buying cocoa based on a Malaysian price of 1,200 stg a tonne, he would accept Ghana offers up to 1,337 stg.     Differentials were fixed as follows,  Country       Differential stg/tonne  Malaysia           0  Brazil            55  Ivory Coast       67  Cameroun          77  Nigeria          120  Togo             130  Ghana            137     Nigeria\'s differential is on \"landed weight\" terms.

'The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday.     \"Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday,\" a consumer delegate said. \"The atmosphere is excellent.\"     Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1, if the rules are agreed by Friday.     A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon -- a big step toward a \"very interesting stage of negotiations,\" delegates said.     The package, based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit during fortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates.     Producers, the European Community (EC) and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow.     Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired, delegates said.     The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference to ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins, they said.     The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager, the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council.     Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they said.     The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby, intermediate and forward positions, they added.     One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is \"transparency,\" meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager\'s market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible, delegates said.     After the tin market collapse in 1985, when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism, they said.      Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn, delegates said.     The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The existing buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable until rules are agreed.      Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules, producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices, delegates said.  \n',25
'A final compromise proposal on cocoa buffer stock rules presented by International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftly gaining acceptance by consumer and producer members, delegates said.     \"We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but we still have some work to do,\" producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of Ghana tolds after a producers\' meeting.     European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumers accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted \"no problems\" in getting full consumer acceptance.     Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement today, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, they said.     The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue has been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations.     The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier proposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates said. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted.     Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into the buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to him.     The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move some delegates described as \"just fiddling.\"     But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease some countries that were not satisfied with the original proposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said.     The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or forward positions, delegates said.     If the compromise is accepted by the council, most consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect next week, or as soon as practically possible.     The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to discuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if all parties are satisfied, they said. Consumers are due to meet before the council.  \n',25
'The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said.     Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 \"must buy\" level.     Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations, traders said.     Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1,600 SDR \"must buy\" level.     The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second, third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per tonne yesterday.     Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and September, but these are set to change to July, September and December on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot month, traders noted.     The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market.     But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the indicator which governs his activities, traders said.     \"The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,\" an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.     Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln.     A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87 world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of 94,000 tonnes, traders said.     In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the \"must buy\" level.     But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market.     The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non-members could limit the buffer stock\'s scope for action, dealers said.     Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin.     But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.     Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said.     Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures.     Ghana\'s premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying, dealers said.     \"The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas,\" one trader said.     Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were \"all prognostication\" and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.     In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism.  \n',25
'The cocoa buffer stock rules just decided by the International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council will take effect immediately, delegates said.

'International Cocoa Organization\'s, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon continued work towards a compromise plan on how the ICCO buffer stock should buy cocoa, consumer delegates said.     Consumer delegates said Bra Kanon had not formally presented the compromise plan to producers and consumers, and it was unlikely he would do so before Friday, they said.     There was widespread confidence a result on the outstanding items could be reached by Friday, when the council session is due to end, consumers said.     Bra Kanon completed bilateral consultations with several delegations today on the main sticking points in the draft buffer stock rules package, they said.     Certain delegations wanted further discussion on the amount of non-member cocoa the buffer stock will be permitted to buy, differentials for different origin cocoas and limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby, and forward material, the delegates said.     The buffer stock working group finalized the remaining buffer stock rules, with only minor modifications to the original draft buffer stock package produced last week, the delegates said.     The ICCO council is due to elect a new executive director when it reconvenes Friday, producer delegates said.     Producers intend to present a single candidate for the post, and this is most likely to be Edouard Kouame from Ivory Coast, they said.     Earlier, the existing executive director, Kobena Erbynn from Ghana, was expected to re-nominated, but he is now likely to withdraw, the delegates said.

'Representatives of cocoa consuming countries at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules, delegates said.     While consumers do not yet have a common position, an observer said after a consumer meeting, \"They are much more fluid ... and the tone is positive.\"     European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect, delegates said.     At the January meeting, France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate, delegates said. That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules.     The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this month\'s meeting.     The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said.     The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa, delegates said.     A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non-member cocoa question.     A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a consumer meeting.     Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being accepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon.     \"We are waiting to see what consumers say,\" a producer delegate said. \"We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate.\"     The ICCO comprises 33 member countries. Non- members include the U.S., a consumer, and Malaysia, an increasingly important producer.  \n',25
'International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, Council chairman, Denis Bra Kanon, said he will attempt to reach a compromise on buffer stock rules for the International Cocoa Agreement.     Bra Kanon called for bilateral consultations among producers and consumers Thursday morning to resolve outstanding differences on how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and differentials to be fixed for different origin cocoa, consumer delegates told reporters.     Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations individually in attempt to iron out remaining problems.     Producers and consumers indicated support \"in principle\" for the draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past week by a small working group, consumer delegates said.     Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the council session ends, but certain technical points need further clarification, the delegates said.     Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market realities, consumer delegates said.     Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote purchases of quality cocoas, such as Ghana origin, which are normally required by manufacturers, they said.     Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoa might lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa, which would depress prices, they added.  \n',25
'International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer delegates either later today or tomorrow morning, delegates said.     Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding differences, mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for different varieties.     Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow.     Some consuming member nations, including Britain and Belgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct non-member cocoa, delegates have said.     The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower quality non-member cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will most effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is currently pressuring the market.     Producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make up at most a very small percentage of the buffer. They say Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it is a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa Malaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said.     As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said.     Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more expensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said.     Other technical points need to be sorted out, including limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in nearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequent effect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said.  \n',25

'The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said.

European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long.     \"If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further, and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices,\" a European dealer said.     And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying, or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically, dealers said.     The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO, into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range.     A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time.     The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the \"must-buy\" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement, the sources said.     The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said.     The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock.     ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world\'s largest cocoa producer.     \"We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market,\" Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee.     However, some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact.     Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world\'s most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country\'s export earnings, made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock.     According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany, \"Consumers weren\'t perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There were no real winners or losers.\"     Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have, delegates said.     Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to reflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock.     London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg in January 1986.     A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it, according to the agreement.     The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says.     The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said.  \n',25
'Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said.     Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa market support mechanism were improving.     \"The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock rules by the end of next week,\" Ghanaian delegate and producer spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists.     Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations \"optimistic and realistic.\"     The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January, with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs.     The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices.     Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations.     The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates said.     Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme.     The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to non- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system for buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates said.     During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast delegation gave \"an open minded statement\" that it is willing to work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into effect as soon as possible, Baron said.     Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of the ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday to attend the talks, Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place.     Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council session because of a conflicting International Sugar Organization meeting today, but could arrive this afternoon, delegates said.  \n',25
'The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, government delegates and trade experts said.     Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work.     The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations.     The ITC\'s failure has restricted negotiators\' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade.     A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend.     Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would \"distort, not support\" the market.     Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices.     The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the \"must buy\" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact, which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock.     Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets.     A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or selling operations, were carried forward from the previous agreement.     Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.     The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters, and the full council meets on Thursday.     Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member countries such as Malaysia.     Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.     The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities.     European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures market\'s existing differentials for different qualities.     Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market.     Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa.     Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.     The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France siding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations.     The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there.     One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is \"meant to support the market where trade buying is not.\"     In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers.     Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced \"posted price\" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers.     In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.  \n',25
'International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) talks on buffer stock rules have slowed during a crucial phase of negotiations, delegates said, but they remained confident about prospects for reaching agreement by Friday.     Cocoa producers, European Community (EC) consumers and all consumers separately reviewed technical details of a buffer stock rules package distributed yesterday.     The buffer stock working group of consumers and producers was set to meet later today to debate the proposal jointly for the first time, they said.     Delegates said major sticking points were likely to be the amount of non-member cocoa allowed to be bought for the buffer stock, and the fixed price differentials at which different origin cocoas will be offered to the buffer stock manager.     Producers would prefer that non-member cocoa not be included in the buffer stock because, if it is, countries such as Malaysia benefit from the cocoa agreement without joining it, the delegates said.  \n',25
'The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock working group meeting set for 1130 GMT today was rescheduled for 1430, ICCO delegates said.     The meeting was delayed so a draft compromise proposal on buffer stock rules could be completed, they said.     ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn was preparing the plan in consultation with other delegates for presentation to the full working group, they added.  \n',25
'A 250 dlr spot charge will be added to the New York cocoa futures, July delivery, contract starting Wednesday, March 18, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange said.     The March delivery ceases trading March 17, making May and July the two nearby unlimited positions. Previously, March and May were unlimited.     The margin requirement for a May or July position will be 1,000 dlrs--750 dlrs original margin plus 250 dlrs spot fee.  \n',25
'Total Dutch imports of cocoa beans rose to 17,978 tonnes in January from 13,961 in January 1986, while exports fell to 1,852 tonnes from 3,111, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.     Cocoa butter imports rose slightly to 1,699 tonnes from 1,507, while exports fell slightly to 6,211 from 6,293 tonnes.     Imports of cocoa powder fell to 316 tonnes from 469 and exports to 5,944 from 6,106 tonnes.  \n',25
'The new International Cocoa Agreement should lead to a stabilisation of prices, both benefitting producer countries and promoting an equilibrium in international economic relations, European Community Development Commissioner Lorenzo Natali said.

'Haiti and Czechoslovakia have joined the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), bringing membership in the United Nations charter body to 18 importing countries and 17 exporters, ICCO officials said.

'The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) Council reached agreement on rules to govern its buffer stock, the device it uses to keep cocoa off the market to stabilise prices, ICCO delegates said.     The date on which the new rules will take effect has not been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into force early next week, after which the buffer stock manager can begin buying or selling cocoa.     Since prices are below the \"may-buy\" level of 1,655 Special Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact, the manager is likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said.     Delegates and traders said they expected the manager, Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks of the pact coming into force.     The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a posted price as in the previous cocoa accord.     The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of differentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa.     Purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate and forward positions.     The council meeting, which is expected to conclude two weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the council itself, was continuing, the delegates said.     The current cocoa agreement came into force on January 20 during a previous meeting of the council which was unable to agree on the rules to implement buffer stock operations.  \n',25
'The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said.     The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate, they said.     The proposal involved three key principles. First, the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.     Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.     The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be set by a formula, the delegates said.     After the plan was presented, working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.     Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from, one consumer delegate said.     Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.  \n',25
'International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) producers and consumers accepted the principles of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation, delegates said.     The buffer stock working group then asked ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, who wrote up the draft compromise, to flesh out details of the principles with the assistance of a representative group of delegates, they said.     The working group broke up for the day, into a smaller group of five producers and five consumers to discuss administrative rules and into the group headed by Erbynn to hammer out buffer stock rules details, delegates said.     Delegates said many differences of opinion still have to be ironed out. \"Whenever we start getting into details the clouds gather,\" one delegate said.     Erbynn is likely to present fleshed out details of the buffer stock rules proposal to the working group early tomorrow, delegates said.     The principles of the draft proposal included establishing an offer system for buffer stock purchases rather than a posted price system, a limit to the amount of non-ICCO member cocoa that can be bought, and differentials to be paid for different varieties of cocoa comprising the buffer stock, delegates said.  \n',25
'The International Cocoa Council, ICCO, adjourned for the day after a detailed proposal on buffer stock rules was distributed and executive committee officials were elected, delegates said.

The buffer stock working group is to meet again on rules Monday morning, and the full council is to reconvene Tuesday, delegates said.     Heinz Hofer of Switzerland was elected executive committee chairman and Mette Mogstad of Norway vice chairman, they added.  \n',25
'The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and consumer views on buffer stock rules and agreeing to examine a draft compromise proposal on the buffer stock issue tomorrow, delegates said.     ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what some delegates called a \"pre-compromise\" and present it to the buffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday, they said.     While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a buffer stock should be implemented, both sides reiterated they were willing to compromise to come to agreement, they said.     \"I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement -- maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but some time later in the session,\" a consumer delegate said.     Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of ICCO member cocoa, comprise a representative basket of various grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades, delegates said.     Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be able to buy non-member cocoa also, and pay a single price for the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin.     Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the buffer stock should operate, with several countries backing different aspects of the producer stance, delegates said.     The semi-annual council meeting is scheduled to run until March 27. Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the most controversial topic on the agenda, delegates said.  \n',25

'A senior Ivory Coast Agriculture Ministry official confirmed his country\'s backing for a new international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week.     The official tolds that Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks, convened by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), in London on Monday.     While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeral ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, scheduled to be held in the country\'s capital Yamoussoukro between March 19-22, senior Ivorian delegates will be present throughout the London talks, the official said.     Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours that he or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public mourning in the West African nation helped depress already low world cocoa prices Friday.     The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the new pact, which was agreed in principle last year by most of the world\'s cocoa exporters and consumers.     He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCO Council chairman during the talks, scheduled to end on March 27.     The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the pact\'s buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market hit by successive world cocoa surpluses.     Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices.  \n',25
'Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) council, will not be able to open the council session here tomorrow, an Ivorian ICCO delegate tolds.

The council session will be chaired instead by ICCO vice chairman Sir Denis Henry, the delegate from Grenada, ICCO officials said.

'Jacobs Suchard AG expects a world cocoa surplus of around 100,000 tonnes in 1987 compared with a 104,000 tonne surplus in 1986, Jens Sroka, head of commodity buying, told a news conference.     The company expects prices to remain at around current levels despite the likelihood of agreement on buffer stock rules at the forthcoming London cocoa talks, and believes market intervention by the buffer stock manager would stabilise prices.     Sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weak if any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement.     Sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproduction will continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast a continued build-up in stocks.     The recent failure of the London coffee talks had surprised market observers.     Unless reason prevails and the major producers return to the conference table, the world coffee market will remain free and the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee for their foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic, Sroka added.  \n',25

'Leading cocoa producers will discuss whether newly-agreed rules on an international cocoa buffer stock will succeed in reversing a sharp fall in world prices when they start four day\'s of talks here later today, conference sources said.     Another topic likely to be discussed at the twice-yearly meeting of the Cocoa Producer Alliance (CPA) is the pact\'s second line of market support -- a witholding scheme under which exporters can take up to 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if buffer stock purchases fail to defend prices.     The International Cocoa Organisation is due to discuss the scheme at a meeting in June, and exporters could use the Yaounde talks to work out a common position on the issue, the sources said.     Delegates will also be briefed on arrangements for an international cocoa research conference due to take place in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic next month, CPA secretary general D.S. Kamga said.     The 11-member CPA include the world\'s top three producers of Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana and accounts for around 80 pct of world output.  \n',25
'Cocoa futures fell to session lows by midmorning, posting losses from last night of six to two stg a tonne in 1987 deliveries, dealers said.     Weekend profittaking by jobbers and general book-squaring featured the fall which was aided by steady sterling versus the dollar and lack of offtake in the physicals market.     Dealers said the market was switch and straddle-bound, in that any pressure on one particular month was certain to be reflected in adjacent deliveries.     The undertone, however, remained cautious as operators await an eventual start to ICCO buffer stock buying, dealers said.     The market was originally forecast to open with average five stg gains from last night following New York\'s firmer close yesterday, dealers said.     But this was largely counter-balanced by currency factors.     Near July traded at its session low of 1,327 stg after one hour versus 1,333 bid last night and an early high of 1,335.     Volume midmorning was 730 lots including 350 lots crossed and 108 switches.     There was no sign of any origin activity.  \n',25
'Madagascar\'s cocoa production is estimated 13 pct higher this year at 2,720 tonnes, up from 2,400 in 1986, Agriculture Ministry officials said.     This improvement reflects the government\'s efforts over the last seven years to extend existing cocoa plantations and plant new higher yielding varieties, particularly at the northern tip of the island, they said.     Last year, Madagascar exported 2,189 tonnes of high quality cocoa, up from 1,624 in 1985, the Trade Ministry said.     This year\'s exports are estimated at 2,400 tonnes.  \n',25
'Government officials in Malaysia, a major cocoa producer, have declined to say whether it will join the International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) for which buffer stock rules were agreed in London last week.     Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January the cabinet would decide on Malaysia\'s participation, but so far a decision has not been announced. The government is said to be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growers and traders tolds they are against the idea because certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage.     Malaysia is the world\'s fourth largest cocoa producer. The government feels that the pact, through its buffer stock mechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which is labouring under surpluses, officials said.     But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia\'s participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for exports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA.     They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it because a big portion of Malaysia\'s cocoa exports, officially estimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members.     Most growers and traders added they are also against a buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump.     Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year, might be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30 mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and this might affect their economic viability, they said.     \"The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it will be a real messy business for the government and the trade if it ever occurs,\" an industry source said.     The growers and traders also said that under new buffer stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not a member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is also allowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile.     Under the new rules purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock.     Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to join the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it need not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries to join the agreement even at a later date.  \n',25
'New York cocoa traders reacted with caution to today\'s developments at the International Cocoa Organization talks in London, saying there is still time for negotiations to break down.     \"I would be extremely cautious to go either long or short at this point,\" said Jack Ward, president of the cocoa trading firm Barretto Peat. \"If and when a final position comes out (of the ICCO talks) one will still have time to put on positions. The risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possible gain.\"     ICCO producer and consumer delegates this morning accepted the outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation. A smaller group of representatives is now charged with fleshing out the details.     \"Market sentiment has reflected optimism, I would\'t put it any stronger than that,\" Ward said.     \"It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement... but one shouldn\'t forget how much they have to negotiate,\" said another trader of today\'s developments.     Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations and have remained so, traders said.     \"The dealers have got historically small positions in outright terms,\" one trader said.     Speculators have gone net long \"but only slightly so,\" he added.     The recent price strength -- gains of about 52 dlrs the last two days -- has been due in large part to sterling\'s rally against the dollar and in the process has attracted a measure of origin selling, traders said.  \n',25
'Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago.     Trade sources tolds from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop.     The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected.     Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on.     This year\'s crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot.     A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said.     Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits.     Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said.     However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September.     The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1.     \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December,\" one said.     If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974.     Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year\'s output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags.     Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans.     The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year\'s record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30.     Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared.     Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals.     With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said.     This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln.     However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered.  \n',25
'Trade estimates of the coming May/September temporao harvest in Brazil\'s main cocoa growing state of Bahia are now in the 1.5 mln to 2.0 mln 60-kilo bag range against 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln two weeks ago.     Traders in the state capital Salvador tolds the effects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year had been harsher than thought earlier.     Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains in mid-February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing.     Last year\'s temporao, also hit by a dry spell, was 2.77 mln bags. In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1.79 mln bags.     The traders said another factor leading to lower crop predictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for plantations because of low returns on their investment.     Manpower, fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as farmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the past six months coupled with low bean prices.     If such economies continue into the winter months both the temporao and the developing October/April main crop could face serious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would normally be treated against the disease.     Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated incidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say these are not yet significant.     The traders said they expect very low deliveries of temporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the bulk will not appear until the last month, September.     Despite the low loads, trees are said to be in excellent condition and recent flowering and pod setting - which will lead to late temporao/early main crop beans - has been good.  \n',25
'The Algerian authorities have regulated the addition of chickpeas and barley used to make imported coffee go further, the official APS news agency reported.     Taking advantage of scarcity, private roasters were selling ground coffee mixtures which were 75 pct non-coffee, it said. Since the beginning of March, the coffee market has been strictly regulated by the state food marketing monopoly Enapal.     Now a third of imported coffee will be sold as pure beans and two thirds as a ground mixture with a choice of 30 pct chickpeas or 30 pct barley. In March private dealers will handle 2,050 tonnes of pure coffee and Enapal 6,050 tonnes of mixtures.  \n',25
'An 11-day-old strike by Brazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead to a short term supply squeeze abroad, exporters said.     They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed but said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by Brazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been disrupted by port congestion caused by the strike.     A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant Brazil\'s coffee exports have been running at an average two weeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one source added.     By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bags behind registrations, leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shipped during March. By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped, the sources said.     Given Brazil\'s port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags a day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately and not interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffee will inevitably be shipped during April, they added.   \n',25
'Brazil\'s recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.     The developing world\'s most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.     \"That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation,\" Aldo Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics, said.     Roldan tolds that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets, but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable.     \"Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates,\" Roldan said.     The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs.     But he added: \"They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels.\"     Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world\'s largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance.     Negotiations between International Coffee Organization (ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence.     \"Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations, which others wanted changed,\" one senior coffee dealer said.     The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer.     Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the dealer said.     \"If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,\" he said.     New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.     President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas.     Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. \"They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,\" according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.     Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop. \"Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can\'t afford to store the crops,\" he said.     The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields.     \"We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,\" Loewy said.     Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean Association (ASA), said this year\'s Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.     Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.     Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.     He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan.     \"We\'re getting into a period when they (Brazil) are starting to harvest and starting to export,\" Eshleman said. But he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.     Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation.     He said the debt situation was a major consideration. \"The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage,\" he added.     Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said it would not make a big difference.     On other commodity markets, Brazil\'s selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital.     Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which could limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will give it little room to stretch exports, they said.     Brazil\'s other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of surplus. \"Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell, so I don\'t think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it,\" one analyst said.     \"If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would collapse and they can\'t afford to do that,\" she added.  \n',25
'Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following this week\'s breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas, President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster said.     He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country\'s export target to ICO-member countries.     The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added.     It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said.     Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy, but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions.     \"We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause markets to panic,\" Dauster added.     He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement.     \"Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does not need an ICO agreement as a crutch,\" Dauster said.     Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two mln bags in Brazil\'s export quotas.     \"It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover,\" he said.     The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas, he said.     Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil\'s inflexibility had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries.     Close links would continue with these producers, particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present.     He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of roaster buying contracts, although \"no hypothesis has been abandoned.\"     Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for May shipment coffee will be opened.     He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as some exporters had suggested.     He noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11.2 mln and 12 mln bags.     He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate until late April.  \n',25
'The Treasury Department is due to release funds for the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, to pay for the coffee purchased from local producers, the IBC said in a statement.     IBC production director Oripes Gomes said in the statement that payment would be made within the official guarantee prices.     The statement said the IBC is sending a document to the National Monetary Council asking the government to set a budget for the purchase by the Institute of up to five mln bags of coffee until June 30.     Gomes said in the statement there have been no problems in the concession of funds by the Treasury for payment of the coffee delivered to the IBC warehouses by the producers.     He said producers have already delivered 2.2 mln bags, of which 1.5 mln bags have been paid for.     In the future, according to an agreement to be signed with the Treasury, the Institute will no longer need to seek approval by the Treasury to seek the release of additional funds to buy coffee, the statement said.  \n',25

'Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia\'s coffee growers\' federation, said he did not believe any important decisions would emerge from an upcoming meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO).     The ICO executive board is set to meet in London from March 31 and could decide to call a special council session by the end of April to discuss export quotas.     \"It\'s going to be a routine meeting, an update of what has been happening in the market, but it\'s unlikely any major decisions are taken,\" Cardenas told journalists.     Earlier this month, talks in London to re-introduce export quotas, suspended in February 1986, ended in failure.     Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria, also talking to reporters at the end of the weekly National Coffee Committee meeting, said the positions of Brazil and of the United States were too far apart to allow a prompt agreement on quotas.     Brazil\'s coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazil would not change its coffee policies.     Cardenas said the market situation was getting clearer because the trade knew the projected output and stockpile levels of producers.     He said according to ICO statistics there was a shortfall of nine mln (60-kg) bags on the world market between October, the start of the coffee year, and February.  \n',25
'Uganda\'s state-run Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two months due to a bottleneck in export shipments and administrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said.     The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (the equivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers and processors for coffee already delivered, but its present export revenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said.     The board\'s cash crisis has serious implications for the economy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct of Uganda\'s total exports.     The CMB\'s financial difficulties first started in January following delays in rail-freighting export consignments of coffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga.     These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in Uganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan wagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and Tanzanian railway systems, the sources said     Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publicly acknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to local suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for moving exports.     Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze would be resolved in two weeks.     However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies between the Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out of action between February 21 and March 15, causing fresh delays in cargo movements.     Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption of rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned their haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs.     Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB was holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags.     These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda\'s expected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September) crop, the sources said.     According to the sources, the board\'s financial problems have been aggravated by long delays in processing export receipts.     The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle export receipts into payments to local producers, whereas export bills handled by local banks took half that time to process, they said.     The sources said the CMB\'s price structure had been overtaken by Uganda\'s high inflation rate, unofficially estimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a further disincentive to producers, already owed large arrears.     \"The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months behind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and the sooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, the better for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole,\" one of the sources said.     The government is currently negotiating a package of economic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to help Uganda\'s economic recovery after 15 years of political strife.  \n',25
'A meeting of eight Latin American coffee producers ended with a call for continued talks aimed at arriving at an agreement to stabilize international prices.     A statement delivered by the conference\'s president, Nicaragua\'s External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca, said the object of future meetings would be to seek negotiations leading to basic export quotas.     The meeting was attended by representatives from Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. A Panamanian representative attended the meeting as an observer.     Representatives at the meeting said efforts would continue to be made to reach a regional consensus on export quotas which could be presented to the International Coffee Organization.     In opening the meeting, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said the lack of an accord on export quotas was behind falling coffee prices, which he said have caused billions of dollars in losses to countries in the region.     Jorio Dauster, president of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, said his government is committed to working towards an producers accord in order to bring about higher prices.  \n',25
'The sharp fall in international coffee prices will not affect Colombia\'s external credit situation, finance minister Cesar Gaviria tolds.     He said the current depression on world coffee markets was not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on Colombia\'s financial state which he described as sound.     \"Our foreign debt is high, but we can pay and I hope the foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us,\" he said.     Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt of 13.6 billion dlrs.     Calls for a rescheduling of the debt have come this week from the opposition conservative party and the biggest trade union following the coffee price drop. Gaviria said lower coffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987.     Gaviria submitted to the world bank and the inter-american bank last week in new york a borrowing plan, for a total of 3.054 billion dlrs to be disbursed over the next four years, which he said was approved.  \n',25
'Coffee futures dipped further and closed below one dlr a pound for the first time in six years.     Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the lowest price since August, 1981.      Prices have fallen steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas.     The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday.     Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlrs a pound in February, when the organization\'s discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down.     Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests.     In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital.     \"This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices,\" she said.     Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 to 15 cents a pound, analysts said.     Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in New York.     The increase in U.S. banks\' prime rates prompted concern about renewed inflation but the strength of the U.S. dollar discouraged new buying.     \"The market is getting mixed signals and it doesn\'t know which way to go,\" one analyst said.     Cattle futures posted new highs on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live hogs rallied from early losses and frozen pork bellies finished sharply lower.     Cattle prices continued to draw support from the winter storm that swept the Plains states, leaving animals stranded in snowbound fields and feed lots in miserable condition.     Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture Department\'s report Tuesday that producers expanded their breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter. Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices.     Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater production and closed with limit losses.     Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were lower.     Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday\'s USDA report that farmers intend to plant 56.9 mln acres this year, down from 61.5 mln planted last year.     Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67.6 mln acres of corn, which is down from last year\'s 76.7 mln acres, but was larger than analysts expected.  \n',25
'Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said.     The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close.     The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.     Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said.     The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.     In a interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. \"If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried,\" Dauster said, adding \"now it is time to go and sell coffee.\"     But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London\'s futures market last year.     A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months.     The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said.     All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.     Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.     It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\" policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve different share-outs of quota, Dauster said.     Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.     Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers\' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them.     \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said.     Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed.     The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.     More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil\'s Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.     A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability.     In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found.     \"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said.  \n',25
'the sharp fall in international coffee prices will not affect colombia\'s external credit situation, finance minister cesar gaviria tolds.     \"our foreign debt is high, but we can pay, and I hope the foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us,\" he said.     He said the current decline on world coffee markets was not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on colombia\'s financial state, which he described as sound.     Gaviria said the decline in coffee prices could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987.     The conservative party and the country\'s largest trade union called this week for the debt to be rescheduled following the price drop.

'This morning\'s sharp decline in coffee prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said.     \"The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again,\" a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said.     \"The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present, there is a shortage of quality,\" he said.     \"Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks,\" the roaster added.     Dutch Coffee Roasters\' Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction, it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis.     \"There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement,\" he said.     \"There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation,\" de Vries added.     With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.  \n',25
'A senior Nicaraguan official said a recent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politically disastrous for Latin American coffee-producing countries.     Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO) executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to discuss the fall in coffee prices.     London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to 1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February.     Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on Latin America, both economically and politically.     He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September.     Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil.     Central American economic ministers have estimated the region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in 1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement, Martinez said.     He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because consumer members lack the political will to fully support commodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate to producers.  \n',25
'Coffee quota talks at the International Coffee Organization council meeting here continued this afternoon, but producers and consumers still had not reached common ground on the key issue of how to estimate export quotas, delegates said.     The 54 member contact group was examining a Colombian proposal to resume quotas April 1 under the ad hoc system used historically, with a pledge to meet again in September to discuss how quotas would be worked out in the future, they said.     Delegates would not speculate on the prospects for agreement at this time.     \"Anything could happen,\" one delegate said.  \n',25
'The International Coffee Organization (ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, but delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and consumers were diminishing by the minute.     The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without agreement, delegates said.     The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within the next six weeks or in September, they said.     The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates said.     Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought which cut Brazil\'s crop by nearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world\'s largest coffee producer and exporter.  \n',25
'The collapse of International Coffee Organization, ICO, talks on export quotas yesterday removes the immediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing the customs service to monitor coffee imports, analysts here said.     The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation offered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffee imports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. A bill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.).     However, the failure of the ICO talks in London to reach agreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is not immediately needed, one analyst said. Earlier supporters of the coffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.     \"You\'re going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now) this is an urgent issue,\" the coffee analyst said.  \n',25
'Failure of talks on re-establishing International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States, particularly the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by \"objective criteria\", U.S. officials said.     Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head of Washington\'s delegation to the talks, tolds on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary.     Rosenbaum said the United States will be \"flexible\" in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas.     At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S., proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer\'s recent exportable production and verified stocks, while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil, by far the world\'s largest producer.     Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S. customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas.     He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks, but \"nobody is proposing we change our position.\"     However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia, to soften the consumer position.     \"Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers,\" said one U.S. official.     The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London.     This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S. officials said.     The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S. officials said.     El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to objective criteria.     There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question, U.S. officials said.     Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions.     In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.     This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.     However, U.S. sources said West Germany\'s support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks.     A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult, although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.     While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil\'s position.     U.S. officials blamed Brazil\'s intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.  \n',25
'The failure of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.     Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.     A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss quotas was set, delegates said.     Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.     With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.     Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring, coffee dealers said.     The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks.     Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council adjourned, \"A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria.     \"We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their political influence in the ICO.\"     Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster countered, \"Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas, not negotiate them.\"     Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme.     But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil\'s share to 28.8 pct.     Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries\' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it.     A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together.     Delegates speculated Brazil\'s financial problems, illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings.     Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO\'s failure to agree quotas, analysts said.     The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates forecast.     The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full council is not due to meet again until September, delegates said.  \n',25

'Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last week\'s International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export quotas.     \"We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions,\" Gaviria tolds in an interview.     The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London.     Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it impossible.     In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences, not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries.     He tolds that Colombia, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less.     According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country\'s total export revenue.     That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400 mln dlrs from 1986.     Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the start of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30.  \n',25
'Private coffee exporters say Colombia\'s more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the country does not suffer excessively from current depressed prices and erratic market conditions.     Gilberto Arango, president of the exporters\' association, said in an interview that Colombia, the world\'s second largest producer, was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas.     \"Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most from this situation,\" he said.     Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986, and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue.     Arango said that government measures adopted here last week, including a lower export registration price, indicated a major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism.     \"This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world market conditions are also new,\" he said.     The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said the export registration price, or reintegro, will be changed more often in order to closely reflect market trends.     Arango said an illustration of Colombia\'s new attitude was the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an unlimited amount.     But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy selling of coffee.     \"Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of giving its coffee away.\"     Colombia\'s past records should be the basis for upcoming exports, he said.     \"We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but neither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows full well what Colombia\'s export potential is,\" he said.     Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986.     Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions but said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not exceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by the National Coffee Growers\' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a figure he said was \"ridiculous.\"     He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in the number one producing province of Antioquia, meant output was likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and oscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags.     On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango said Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed to force a compromise.     Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and head of his nation\'s delegation in London, has blamed the intransigence of some big countries, without naming them.     However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar Gaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United States would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming weeks to revise its policy.     \"Washington will have to take into account that for many countries, and some of its allies for instance in Central America, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have far-reaching political and economic consequences.\"     Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts.  \n',25
'Colombia denied having sold 440,000 60-kg bags of old crop coffee below current market prices to clients in Europe and Asia.     A spokesman for the National Coffee Growers Federation, commenting on rumours which had circulated in market circles, said these were false.  \n',25
'Coffee producing countries must quickly map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia\'s private coffee exporters\' association, said.     Arango tolds that the most intelligent thing now would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.     An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.     Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet.     However, he said the market should also take into account evident factors such as Brazil\'s low stocks and the sale of the near totality of the Central American crop.     Trade sources said Colombia\'s coffee was today quoted at 1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past 10 years.     Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations as well as for industrialized countries.     It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to solve the problem of the developing world\'s external debt, decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying those debts, he said.     \"In Colombia\'s case, we watch with consternation that, while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,\" Cardenas said.  \n',25
'Colombia will not attend a meeting of coffee producing countries scheduled for this weekend in Nicaragua, Jorge Cadenas, manager of the National Coffee Growers\' Federation, said.     \"We prefer to wait until things are better prepared,\" he tolds. He added the meeting could be postponed.     Colombia, Brazil and the Central American coffee producing countries were invited to the meeting in Managua to analyze the market situation     However, he did not dismiss the idea of dialogue and negotiation in preparation for meetings of the International Coffee Organization.     Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia\'s exporters\' association, speaking tos earlier this week, ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts.     The International Coffee Organization executive board is to meet in London between March 31 and April 2.  \n',25
'Colombia intends to improve the marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on setting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar Gaviria said.     Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export registration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock New York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile.     \"In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that will allow private exporters to participate more actively in Colombia\'s coffee export policy,\" he said.     Traders said this means the export registration price will change more often in a truer reflection of market trends.     Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market factors since a return to a system of International Coffee Organisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short term.     ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986.     Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices with increased volume.     \"Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of coffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will do so without an agreement among producers,\" he said.     He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5 mln bags as mentioned in market circles, \"because the idea is precisely not to disrupt the market.\"     Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September 30.     Echoing Gaviria\'s words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national coffee growers\' federation, said Colombia sought to adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances.     \"There is great expectation in the world for the policies that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the immediate future,\" he told journalists.     Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil\'s future export policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.     Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks have been resolved.     Asked to comment on a report from Jakarta saying Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the Brazilian stand was quite clear.     He said Brazil\'s current quota \"reflects the reality of the market, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand,\" but added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that determined it.     Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible, which did not happen.  \n',25
'Costa Rica\'s economy minister said he sees new hope for winning changes in the International Coffee Organisation system of export quotas.     Minister Luis Diego Escalante, who serves as president of the Costa Rican Coffee Institute, said he was hopeful because of the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing- nations by such major consumers as the United States, Britain and the Netherlands at last week\'s ICO meeting in london.     Escalante told a news conference here he \"carried the weight of the negotiations\" at the meeting by calling for larger export quotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations.     Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quota system based on a producing nation\'s real export capacity, once it has satisfied internal demand.     \"There are countries such as our own whose sales possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current quotas,\" Escalante said.     At the same time, there are countries favoured by the current system that have been assigned quotas far above their export potential, he said.     The current ICO quota system is \"unfair and autocratic,\" Escalante said.     Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffee prices over the last week to speculation rather than real matters of supply and demand.     \"Be careful,\" he warned, \"there\'s not as much coffee in the world as they say. What there is are bags of sawdust.\"  \n',25

'The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when it reopens export registrations, probably later this week, exporters said.     They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were closed in mid-February.     To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed.     However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets, and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the exporters said.     They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed producer price.     Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval.     The sources said it is still unclear when registrations will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of this week.     \"Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently closed down,\" one exporter said.     However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is likely to wait to see if tomorrow\'s meeting of the International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss reintroduction of export quotas, sources said.     There is also talk of the announcement this week of new measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters said.     Another factor which could be delaying the opening of registrations is the current strike by bank workers which, while not affecting current shipments, could affect documentation and currency operations for new sales.     This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or three days of registering a sale. \n',25
'Jorio Dauster, president of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, left Brazil early today to attend a weekend meeting of Latin American coffee producers in Managua, an IBC official said.     Carlos Brasil, an adviser to the IBC president, said Dauster had left Rio de Janeiro for Managua early this morning.     There were rumours on the London coffee market earlier today that Dauster would not attend the meeting.  \n',25
'Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) president Jorio Dauster said he will not attend the ICO executive board meeting and was surprised to hear that a report of his absence had a slightly depressing effect on the New York coffee market today.     \"I have too much work to accomplish here in Brazil at the moment. Besides the presence of the IBC president at an ICO executive board meeting is not a tradition,\" Dauster said.     Dauster said except in rare cases, Brazil has always sent its London-based representative to ICO board meetings. Ambassador Lindenberg Sette will attend the meeting, he said.  \n',25
'Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) president Jorio Dauster said he will attend a meeting in Managua this weekend.     He tolds by telephone from Brasilia that the meeting, involving Brazil, Colombia and Central American coffee producers, will be strictly to review the coffee market situation.     \"The meeting is set for Saturday but could also continue on Sunday,\" he said.  \n',25
'The Brazilian Coffee Institute today registered 1.4 mln 60 kilo bags of green coffee for May shipment, an IBC statement said.     This brings the total in the two days registrations have been open to 2.05 mln, including 4,868 bags of soluble.     Today\'s registrations comprised 1,076,226 bags to members and 326,259 to non-members of the International Coffee Organisation. No soluble sales were registered today.  \n',25
'The International Coffee Organization (ICO) executive board meeting scheduled for the end of this month has been delayed by one day and will now run from March 31 to April 2 and not March 30 to April 1, ICO officials said.     On March 30, the ICO ad hoc working group will meet to consider management consultants Ernst &amp; Whinney\'s report on the ICO secretariat. This report was commissioned late last year to report on the administrative structure of the ICO.  \n',25
'Executive board members of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issue of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here, delegates said.     No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no further discussion on the issue is likely during the three-day talks, they said.     Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to agree export quota shares in early March.     Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., the largest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said.     \"The situation is unchanged,\" consumer spokesman Abraham Van Overbeeke told reporters. \"As long as Brazil sticks to its position there will not be quotas -- there is no point in meeting.\"     At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumers and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution of export shares using \"objective criteria,\" which would likely have reduced Brazil\'s share.     Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota negotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal was accepted would no longer be on the table.     \"As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million bags,\" he tolds.     Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the African and Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered by Angola, are also no longer valid, delegates said.     The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a briefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent Latin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said.     There, the producers expressed their political will to negotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of the damaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to agree quotas, Montes said.     The ICO board also reviewed export statistics and stock verification. They expected talks on stock verification to take up the remainder of today\'s session, delegates said.  \n',25
'Chances that the International Coffee Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO delegates and trade sources said.     ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said.     ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement.      \"Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions, it\'s difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,\" Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be negotiated sometime, he said.      The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates said.      At this week\'s March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some administrative matters, according to a draft agenda.     The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned.     \"I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal by September (the next scheduled council meeting),\" Bronwyn Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said.     Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a date will be set for an earlier council meeting.     If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989.     When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise.     Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares, under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports, but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares to be redistributed using \"objective criteria,\" which would have threatened Brazil\'s share.     At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers, Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their objections as members of the group of eight ICO \"dissident\" producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief producers on the Managua meeting.     However, other producers said they were not aware of this move toward producer solidarity.     London coffee prices closed at 1,276 stg a tonne today, down from around 1,550 at the beginning of March.  \n',25
'International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers will meet at 1500 GMT (0900 est) for a general discussion of the market situation, producer spokesman Lindenberg Sette said.     The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested the meeting but Brazil was not among them. The ICO executive board\'s regular session this week has so far been confined to routine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers to revive export quota negotiations, delegates said.     Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when producers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how quotas should be allocated.     Producer delegates said there was no sense of urgency among producers to reopen quota talks with consumers, with most countries now prepared to wait for the ICO\'s annual September council session to restart negotiations.     Members of the Inter-African Coffee Organization called for today\'s producer meeting to exchange views on the market situation, the producer delegates said.     The lack of a new debate on export quotas here this week was cited as the reason for renewed weakness in coffee prices in London and New York futures, traders said.     Near May in London hit a five-year low this morning at 1,220 stg, about 50 stg below last night\'s close, they said.     The executive board session looks set to end today, following a final session at 1600 GMT (1000 est) when a consultancy report of the operation of the ICO will be presented to producers and consumers, delegates added.  \n',25
'A special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council failed to agree on how to set coffee export quotas, ICO delegates said.     Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, often heated talks, delegates said.     Export quotas -- the major device of the International Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in Brazil which cut its output by two thirds.     Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffee prices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four year lows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting.  \n',25
'International Coffee Organization (ICO) exporters will modify their new proposal on quota resumption before presenting it to importers tomorrow, ICO delegates said.     The change, which will be discussed tonight informally among producers, follows talks after the formal producer session with the eight-member producer splinter group and will affect the proposed quota distribution for 12 months from April one, they said.     The proposed share-out would still include shortfall declarations, they said.  \n',25
'The prospects of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) reaching an agreement on coffee export quotas before September appear dim, Alberto Hesse, former president of the European Coffee Federation, said.     \"There is no real goodwill in certain delegations to go to quotas,\" Hesse, who advises the Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry on coffee issues, tolds. He declined to name the delegations.     A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set quotas.     The ICO executive board will meet from March 30 to April 1 but the full council is not due to meet again until September. \"I am not optimistic about an agreement soon,\" Hesse said.  \n',25
'International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing countries will present a proposal for reintroducing export quotas for 12 months from April 1 with a firm undertaking to try to negotiate up to September 30 any future quota distribution on a new basis, ICO delegates said.     Distribution from April 1 would be on an unchanged basis as in an earlier producer proposal, which includes shortfall redistributions totalling 1.22 mln bags, they said.     Resumption of an ICO contact group meeting with consumers, scheduled for this evening, has been postponed until tomorrow, delegates said.  \n',25
'Talks at the extended special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the reintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of success were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said.     Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September, with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop year, they said.     Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a quota agreement varied widely.     Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly more optimistic. But Brazil\'s unwillingness to concede any of its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks likely to preclude any accord, other delegates said.     No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had been tabled formally today, delegates said.     A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a progress report, delegates said.  \n',25
'The failure of International Coffee Organization talks on the reintroduction of quotas has paralysed business on the Hamburg green coffee market in the past week, trade sources said.     There was only sporadic activity for spot material, which was mainly requirement buying, they said, adding that pre-registered coffees were no longer available.     They said they expected Brazil and Colombia to open export registrations for May shipment next week. However, the president of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster, said yesterday he had not yet decided when its registrations would reopen.  \n',25
'The restoration of coffee export quotas before the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept 30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates told reporters.     Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the quota dialogue while Brazil\'s position remains unchanged, they said.     Brazil\'s refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30 pct share of the ICO\'s global export quota effectively torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas before October, the delegates noted.     Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today, traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said.     Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in practice the idea had effectively been discarded.     The ICO\'s executive board session here this week has so far barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are still remote, producer delegates said.     Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored, despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last month\'s negotiations, they said.     \"With Brazil\'s frost season approaching, who wants to negotiate quotas,\" one leading producer delegate said.     Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil\'s frost season (mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil\'s crop.     Many producers are more interested in working towards reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of quota allocations valid until the International Coffee Agreement expires in 1989, they said.     Guatemala has already proposed the \"other oilds\" producer group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how to allocate quota shares.     Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the principle of \"objective criteria\" favoured by consumers.     At last month\'s council session a splinter group of small producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments.     A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause.     The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak.     The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of quota shares based on \"objective criteria.\"     ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets in September.     Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee, they said.     They said Brazil\'s reluctance to open coffee export registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which would most likely end in failure.     Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said.     Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not fixed, he said.     The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled, delegates said.  \n',25
'Talks on coffee export quotas at the International Coffee Organization (ICO) special council session will resume at noon gmt today, following a last minute decision taken early this morning to extend the meeting 24 hours, ICO officials said.     An 18 member contact group will meet at midday to examine new ideas, and the full council is to convene at 1900gmt, they said.     The extension resulted from a last ditch effort by Colombia to salvage the talks, which by late yesterday looked perilously close to ending without agreement on quotas, delegates said.  \n',25
'The International Coffee Organization executive board meeting will end tomorrow without any move to reopen the debate on restoring coffee export quotas, delegates said.     Talks have focused on administrative matters and verification of stocks in producer countries, they said.     Producers met briefly today to exchange views on the market situation but there seems little chance discussion on quotas will begin much before the ICO\'s annual council session in September, they said.     Delegates earlier thought the meeting would end tonight, but a further session is scheduled tomorrow at 1030 GMT to complete reports on stock verification.     Meantime, the executive board will meet May 12 to discuss possible action on the consultancy report on the ICO presented today to the board, consumer delegates said.  \n',25
'India cut the export duty on coffee to 330 rupees per 100 kg from 600 rupees, effective March 23, a Coffee Board official said.     The reduction should help India reach its coffee export target of 90,000 tonnes in fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31, against provisionally estimated exports of 75,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and an actual 99,254 tonnes in 1985/86, he said.     India is likely to press for international export quotas at a meeting of coffee producers in London this week because of depressed prices, he added.     The International Coffee Organisation, which represents both consumers and producers, has so far failed to reach agreement on quotas.     India feels it will be useful to have quotas now because the slide in prices is unlikely to be halted immediately, he said.     Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged after a drought devastated Brazil\'s coffee crop.  \n',25
'Indonesian coffee exporters are preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of export quotas, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE) tolds.     Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia, the world\'s third largest producer, is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas.     \"But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we can never bridge the gap,\" Dharyono said.     Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries, along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a new quota system at last month\'s failed International Coffee Organistion (ICO) talks in London.     Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal.     AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise.     Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia, the world\'s second largest producer, but gave no details.     \"Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market stays like it is,\" Muda said.     He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1.     Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S. And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia\'s case more firmly.     He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country\'s coffee traders through the ICO negotiations.     Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed \"realistic criteria.\"     The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends.     Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied.     Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop.     Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both refusing to alter their positions.     Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices.     Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said.     Indonesia\'s coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30, is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year\'s level of 360,000 tonnes, he said.     He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for the time of year.  \n',25
'Indonesia\'s coffee production in 1986/87 ending September 30 may fall slightly from last year\'s level of 360,000 tonnes, Dharyono Kertosastro, chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters tolds.     He said shade trees had been damaged by pests and this may have affected the crop, though it remains to be seen how seriously. Indonesia\'s main crop is harvested next month.     He gave no figure for expected output, except to say it would probably be down a little from 1985/86. He said stocks were about normal at 90,000 tonnes.     Kertosastro predicted that exports were unlikely to rise much from last year\'s level of 320,000 tonnes. \"I expect exports will be a bit more, maybe 330,000 tonnes, but not above that,\" he said. Exports in 1985/86 were valued at 944 mln U.S. Dlrs, but the value could fall by 30 pct this year because of low prices, he added.     Dharyono said production was behind a five year plan target of 420,000 tonnes for the current year, but Indonesia is trying to boost output through introduction of higher yielding seeds, better training for farmers and increased use of fertilizers.  \n',25
'Ivory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in London would not last long.     Commenting on Monday\'s failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions.     \"I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April,\" he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks.     Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the lowest since 1982.     Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues.     He disclosed that his country - the world\'s biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month.     Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of the continent\'s 25 producer nations at the London talks.     \"An initiative from IACO is likely very soon,\" he said without elaborating.     \"Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market,\" he said.     Questioned by journalists, the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season.     Last year, the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents) per kilo.     Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation.     A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today\'s weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed \"his faith in Ivory Coast\'s bright (economic) future\" despite the commodities price slide.     The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country\'s small farmers.     Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of Africa\'s showpiece economies, is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee.     Ivory Coast\'s real gross domestic product is expected to grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986, according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate.  \n',25
'Kenya\'s late coffee crop is flowering well, but the main coffee areas were generally dry and hot in the week ended Wednesday, trade sources said.     \"Machakos, Embu, Meru and Kirinyaga in eastern Kenya, and Nyeri and Thika in central, have been dry in the past week. The farmers expect rain this week. If it does not fall output of the late (October-November-December) crop will decline sharply,\" one source said.     He said that since most growers did not irrigate their crop they could do nothing but wait for rain, the main factor which determines Kenyan coffee production.     Two months ago the International Coffee Organization issued a forecast of Kenyan exportable coffee production in the 1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season at 1.82 mln bags.  \n',25
'The Kenyan economy is heading for difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.     In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.     The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985, he added.     \"But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year,\" he said.     The price of coffee, Kenya\'s main source of foreign exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.     Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.     Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more difficult to finance the government\'s budget deficit.     Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history, he added.     \"This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development,\" he said.     \"It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs,\" the president added.  \n',25
'Representatives from Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Nicaragua will meet here Friday to discuss the economic impact of falling coffee prices, a Nicaraguan official announced.     Vice-minister of foreign trade Bernardo Chamorro said that participating in the meeting will be the heads of the coffee associations from the four countries.     He did not say if the meeting would continue beyond friday.     Chamorro said Nicaragua supports the establishment of export quotas in an effort to boost sagging world prices.  \n',25
'This weekend\'s meeting of Latin American coffee producers here will call for the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) to start talks aimed at firming prices, Nicaraguan foreign trade minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said.     He said those countries which had confirmed their presence were Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama. Colombia had been invited but he did not know if it would attend.     Martinez Cuenca told reporters central america alone had lost some 700 mln dlrs through the weakness of world coffee prices, partially caused by lack of an ICO quota agreement.  \n',25
'Madagascar\'s available coffee output is estimated at 80,725 tonnes this year, down from 82,210 in 1986, due to a rundown of government agricultural services and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas, Agriculture Ministry sources said.     This is after accounting for the loss of some 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside, they said.     The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987, but they noted that shipments declined to 37,200 tonnes last year from 41,662 in 1985.     Low yields from the country\'s ageing coffee plantations and prevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix also contributed to the poor performance, the sources said.     They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascar\'s coffee bushes were planted before 1930.     The sources said Madagascar was still a long way from reaching the production target of 110,000 tonnes per year and the export target of 63,000 tonnes outlined in the government\'s 1986-1990 five-year plan.     In order to reverse the decline in coffee production, the government has decided to plant 20,000 hectares with high-yielding arabica and canephora varieties, the sources said.     The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed at producing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a low caffeine content.     The sources added that Madagascar\'s plan to export roasted coffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems. Only 650 tonnes of roasted coffee were exported last year.  \n',25
'Mexico has temporarily suspended overseas coffee sales due to falling prices triggered by the failure of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting to agree a quota system at its latest meeting, the official Notimex news agency said.     \"We\'re just waiting a while for prices to improve,\" an unidentified Mexican trader told the agency.     Mexico has already sold 80 pct of its export coffee produced in the year to last September, the source said. The country exports about 3.3 mln 60-kilo bags a year.  \n',25
'Several traders and analysts here tolds Latin American coffee producers will meet this weekend in Managua, Nicaragua. The purpose, they said, is to review the breakdown of International Coffee Organization quota talks last month and try to formulate a unified position ahead of possible future negotiations.     Two traders, who asked not to be named, said separately Brazil is expected to attend the meeting along with most or all of the Central American producers. The Central American attendees would include Costa Rica and Honduras, who were part of a minority producer group at the February talks that opposed Brazil\'s position, they said.     Another source, also requesting anonymity, said Colombia probably will not attend.  \n',25
'A decision by Colombia to open coffee export registrations for an unlimited amount does not imply the country will heavily sell coffee until recently withheld, Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters\' association, tolds.     Colombia today opened export registrations for april and may, with the National Coffee Growers\' Federation setting no limit.     Since the start of the coffee year last october, private exporters were on average allowed 350,000 bags of 60 kilos per month.     \"Traders will initially interpret this measure as announcing heavy sales. Even today it pressured the market. But it will quickly become apparent that Colombia does not intend to go over the top,\" Arango said in an interview.     \"Colombia\'s marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately. Colombia has no intention to give its coffee away,\" he added.     Arango described measures adopted here yesterday, including a lower export registration price, as a major change in Colombia\'s coffee marketing policy.     The export registration price, or reintegro, was lowered to 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock new york, or 155.83 dlrs per bag of 70 kilos, from 1.35 dlrs (194.33 dlrs).     The government announced a more flexible policy of reintegro, in order to closely reflect market trends, which arango warmly welcomed saying private exporters will undoubtedly be more actively present in the market.     A frequent gap between international market prices and the reintegro was unlikely to recur, he said.  \n',25
'The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest, trade sources said.     IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government ministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assess Brazil\'s position in the light of the failure of talks in London earlier this month to set new International Coffee Organization, ICO, export quotas.     \"The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink its position completely,\" one Santos exporter said.     A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for Thursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures.     Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry.     Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately. World prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year.     The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of May and June export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set.     With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world markets, they said.     They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned increase in the quota, April registrations were opened and closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record amount for a single day.     If May/June registrations are opened under similar conditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month.     \"The problem would be how to limit sales,\" one exporter said.     Brazil\'s present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to maximise foreign exchange earnings.     However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil\'s dominant position as an exporter, but without causing a price war.     General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO.     The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were reintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks.     With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added.     However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities, as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to encroach on other producers\' markets.     Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly marketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil\'s market share after last year\'s unusually low exports of 9.9 mln bags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial relations with the producer group which backed Brazil\'s stance at the ICO talks, they added.  \n',25
'New York coffee futures prices will probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts.     Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00 dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the International Coffee Organization did not place new export quota discussions on its current agenda.     Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February.     \"Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents, perhaps 85 cents,\" said William O\'Neill, coffee analyst with Elders Futures. \"But the additional downside may not be all that great from current levels.\"     \"At this price level the market is very vulnerable to bullish developments,\" O\'Neill added. \"Rather than us having a market that will plummet we\'ll kind of see prices erode -- probably to around 85 cents.\"     \"I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief drop to 85 cents,\" said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor, with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time.     A trader at a major international trade house, who asked not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high export price and requires a high contribution quota from exporters the market could steady at the lower levels.     Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on Brazil to agree to consumers\' export quota terms, and a new international agreement could come into force next fall.     Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and demand.     Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will need to do some buying soon.     \"Most producing nations have just completed or are about to complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly overburdened,\" said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson Lehman, in that firm\'s forthcoming quarterly coffee report.     Kaul said producers\' need to procure hard currency to service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell, and \"this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows.\"     Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before Brazil\'s frost season begins in June.     Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by, though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is passed and demand usually slows this time of year.     Shearson\'s Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown for the usually busy winter roasting season.     But Elders O\'Neill said, \"The roasters are not overstocked by any means.\"     Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult, given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short term.  \n',25
'Coffee producers belonging to the \"Other Milds\" group will meet May 4 in Guatemala to discuss the possibility of restoring export quotas, producer delegates told reporters after the closing session of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, executive board meeting.     The \"Other Milds\" group, comprising Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Mexico, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea and Peru, might consult with Brazil and Colombia on this meeting, but it was not certain whether these two countries would attend, they said.     The ICO board meeting ended without moves to restart negotiations on quotas, which broke down last month, producer delegates said.     Producers are expected to hold other consultations in the coming months on how to proceed with quota negotiations, but no date for a full producer meeting has been mentioned, they said.     The board completed reports on stock verification and the next regular board session will be in Indonesia June 1-5, delegates said.  \n',25
'U.S. roastings of green coffee in the week ended March 21 were about 250,000 (60-kilo) bags, including that used for soluble production, compared with 195,000 bags in the corresponding week of last year and about 300,000 bags in the week ended March 14, George Gordon Paton and Co Inc reported.     It said cumulative roastings for calendar 1987 now total 3,845,000 bags, compared with 4,070,000 bags by this time last year.  \n',25
'Recent heavy rains have not affected the Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record harvest, the president of one of Peru\'s four coffee cooperative groups said.     Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group of cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru\'s exports, tolds a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos) was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101 quintales in the year to September 1986.     A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood waters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and the crop was unaffected.     Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa Rica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales last year, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation.     Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if they continued through to next month, when harvesting starts.     He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this year in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales, assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO.     He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO members last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another 235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICO members.  \n',25
'Philippine coffee exports are expected to fall sharply due to a combination of the International Coffee Organisation\'s (ICO) decision not to revive export quotas and higher local prices, ICO Certifying Agency official Dante de Guzman tolds.     He said exporter registrations dropped from an average weekly 500 tonnes in March to 45 tonnes last week, with exports in coffee year 1986/87, ending September, forecast to total about 8,000 tonnes against 48,000 in 1985/86.      \"Because of the relatively higher level of domestic prices, it has become difficult to service exports,\" de Guzman said, adding that most exporters are taking a wait and see attitude.     Coffee production was expected to drop slightly to about one mln bags of 60 kg each in the 1986/87 crop year ending June from 1.1 mln bags last year, he said.  \n',25

'Talks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum.     The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices.     However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight.     World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil\"s output by nearly two thirds.     Brazil is the world\"s largest coffee producer and exporter.     Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said.     Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate.     The big producers \"want to have the ball only in their court and it isn\"t fair,\" minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said.     The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30, delegates said.     Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.     But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics.     Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later.     Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said.     Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. \"Anything is possible at this phase,\" even adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said.     If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said.     Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either, they said.  \n',25
'The failure of talks to introduce new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee Agreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil having a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon said.     He tolds proposals to reduce Brazil\'s quota to 25 pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.     \"Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,\" Calmon added.     Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota, Brazil\'s share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln bags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln, leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.     \"It\'s a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was better than such a quota reduction,\" he added.     In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green coffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under 10 mln bags.     Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, of which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest this year should be around 30 mln bags, he added.     The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last year\'s harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believe it was higher than this.  \n',25
'The onset of cooler weather in Brazil during the southern hemisphere winter is expected to have a stabilising effect on a weak coffee market, West German trade sources said.     \"The annual fear of frost in Brazil will probably grip the market sometime this month until June or early July,\" one trader said.     The trade believes the International Coffee Organization (ICO) is unlikely to tackle the re-introduction of quotas before its September meeting and until then the market will not see any unexpected sharp moves in either direction.  \n',25
'Efforts to break an impasse between coffee exporting and importing countries over regulating the world coffee market in the face of falling prices appear to have failed, senior delegates said after a contact group meeting. The full ICO council is due to meet this evening.     President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) Jorio Dauster tolds after the contact group meeting there had been no agreement on quotas as consumers had tried to dictate market shares rather than negotiate them.     Dauster said there are no plans yet to renew negotiations at a later date.  \n',25
'Singapore\'s United Industrial Corp Ltd (UIC) has agreed in principle to inject 16 mln dlrs in convertible loan stock into Teck Hock and Co (Pte) Ltd, a creditor bank official said.     UIC is likely to take a controlling stake in the troubled international coffee trading firm, but plans are not finalised and negotiations will continue for another two weeks, he said.     Teck Hock\'s nine creditor banks have agreed to extend the company\'s loan repayment period for 10 years although a percentage of the new capital injection will be used to pay off part of the debt.     Teck Hock owes more than 100 mln Singapore dlrs and since last December the banks have been allowing the company to postpone loan repayments while they try to find an investor.     The nine banks are Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd, United Overseas Bank Ltd, Banque Paribas, Bangkok Bank Ltd, Citibank N.A., Standard Chartered Bank Ltd, Algemene Bank Nederland NV, Banque Nationale de Paris and Chase Manhattan Bank NA.  \n',25
'Thai coffee exports rose to 22,068 tonnes in 1986 from 20,430 a year earlier, the Customs Department said.  \n',25
'Thai coffee exporters said they hoped the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) would not reimpose export quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in world prices.     Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai Coffee Exporters Association, tolds that Thailand obtained little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only about 30 pct of its total annual exports.     Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who offer higher prices than non-members, he said.     The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985.     Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000 tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the previous year.     However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai government supports coffee producers\' lobbying for reimposed ICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices.     Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial Economics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas would encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market, further depressing prices.     He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantial amount of coffee this month without such restrictions.  \n',25
'The green coffee market saw some demand for high quality coffees in the past week, but business was described as generally unsatisfactory, trade sources said.

Sporadic business was noted in the second hand which offered Kenya coffee for May/June shipment up to 25 dlrs below origin levels.

'The United States does not expect the executive board meeting of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, to call for a new round of negotiations on reinstating coffee quotas, a U.S. government official said.     The official, a member of the U.S. delegation to ICO talks earlier this year, said no new coffee agreement talks are expected because there is no indication the negotiating positions of major producers and consumers have changed.     The U.S. still demands, as a condition of reimposition of coffee quotas, that \"objective criteria\" be set for establishing quotas, said the U.S. official, who asked not to be identified. Brazil, the major producer, insists on quotas based on a traditional formula.     The U.S. remains open to a negotiating meeting but only if some new flexibility is apparent from major countries, the official said.     The ICO executive board meets tomorrow in London.  \n',25
'Uganda, Africa\'s second largest coffee producer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffee talks in London, the chairman of the state-run Coffee Marketing Board, CMB, said.     \"This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in a situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of robusta coffee,\" J. Makumbi said when he returned from London on Friday.     Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula to share the world\'s coffee production during International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week.     Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were suspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that its quota be increased dramatically.     Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings -- had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln 60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB.     The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25 pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to over three mln bags.     For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICO export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry.     The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs over half of salaried manpower.     In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\'s Agriculture and Livestock Development Minister Paul Bomani said today Third World countries would suffer from the failure of the London coffee talks.     \"It is only the middlemen who will benefit, he said.     Bomani called on the ICO to convene another meeting within two months, saying, \"Once tempers have cooled and delegations have had time to report back to their headquarters, common sense will prevail.\"  \n',25
'Long delays at the railway crossing on the Kenyan border have led Uganda to re-route its coffee exports through a ferry link with the Kenyan port of Kisumu across Lake Victoria, Ugandan officials based in Kenya said.     Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port of Mombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external trade but there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons, they said.     Customs at Kisumu take less than a day compared with two to three at the Malaba rail border crossing, a Ugandan Railways official said. \"Malaba is now handling only 10 pct of the trade and all the coffee and oil goes through Kisumu,\" he said.     However, an accident recently damaged the wagon ferry which plies between Kisumu and the Ugandan port of Jinja, causing bottlenecks on the lake route too.     Sources at the Coffee Marketing Board in Kampala reported delays in coffee export shipments last January due to congestion on the lake ferries.     Coffee accounts for about 95 pct of Uganda\'s export earnings and last November President Yoweri Museveni ordered all coffee shipments to be carried by rail in order to avoid the higher costs of road haulage.  \n',25
'Vietnam will resettle 300,000 people on state farms known as new economic zones in 1987, to create jobs and grow more high-value export crops, the communist party newspaper Nhan Dan said.

'U.S. tin disposals should have little effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing countries to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, a government official said.     The agreement by the seven-member Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) aimed to cut the world surplus and boost prices. Following the accord, ATPC Chairman Subroto appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from its strategic stockpile.     \"We don\'t think that (the U.S. government) has a large influence in the (tin) market at this stage of the game,\" said Thomas O\'Donnell, Director of International Commodities at the State Department. Last year the United States released about 4,900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms.  \n',25
'Mine and industry officials from most member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according to views polled by correspondents.     The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16.     Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world\'s tin output.     Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461.     Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year.     Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable.     Mine officials in Malaysia, the world\'s leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1.     Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun tolds that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock.     Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending.     Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing.     ATPC chairman and Indonesia\'s Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country\'s support for the export curb.     A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah tolds it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636.     In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices.     To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said.     The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said.     But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong tolds that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo, Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines.     Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said.     Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota.     Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos tolds in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987.     He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia\'s total exports.     He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate.     Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs.     Industry sources tolds that Nigeria\'s output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year.     ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries\' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period.     The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures.     They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC\'s discretion.     The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan.     Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively during the quota period.  \n',25
'Bolivia\'s top union leader today joined a hunger strike by 1,300 state employed miners and workers to press for higher wages he said.     Juan Lechin Oquendo, the veteran secretary general of the Bolivian Labour Organization, COB, told reporters: \"I am joining the fast to abide with our call for a hunger strike\".     Lechin, 83, became one of 12 COB leaders to join a hunger strike to protest against the austerity programme of the government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro.     The striking leader began his fast as leaders of 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation COMIBOL were due to star negotiations on ways to solve their conflict over pay.     About 1,300 miners and workers entered today their fourth day of fast in union offices and Roman Catholic churches to press for a substantial hike in Bolivia\'s minimum monthly wage, which is 40 bolivianos (about 20 dlrs), COB leader Walter Degadillo said.     \"I will take part in the miners\' negotiations because that does not force me to suspend my fast,\" Lechin told reporters.     The COMIBOL miners\' strike entered its fifth day to press for higher wages and more funds for the mining nationalised industry.     About 20,000 miners, or two-thirds of the working force, have been laid off through the government\'s decision to streamline the deficit-ridden state corporation following a collapse in the international tin price.     The government, faced with mounting social unrest against its economic policies, has called the miners\' strike and fasts part of a campaign aimed at discrediting it during the visit of West German president Richard von Weizsaecker, who began a four-day visit last Friday.     \"I regret not being able to attend an invitation by president Weizsaecker to a dinner tonight because I am on a hunger strike,\" Lechin told reporters. \"I also have to orga- nise the strike.\"     Weizsaecker is hosting a dinner tonight for Paz Estenssoro and had invited both Lechin and Victor Lopez, the miners\' federation top leader. Although lopez has not joined the fast, union sources said its unlikely he would attend the dinner.  \n',25
'About 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation, Comibol, declared a general strike as from midnight (0400 gmt) to press for higher salaries, a statement by the federation for Bolivian mine workers said.      It said the strike was called to defend the nationalised mining industry. The miners were willing to negotiate with the government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, but only if it showed an intention to meet the strikers\' demands.      The government said the strike was designed to cause it embarrassment during the four-day visit of West German President Richard Von Weizsaecker, which starts on Friday.     The miners statement said police had violently evicted Comibol office workers in the city of Oruro after they began a hunger strike yesterday.     The government has sacked about 20,000 miners from its deficit-ridden corporation since the collapse in the international price of tin. The lay-offs represent about two-thirds of the original workforce.  \n',25
'About 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation Comibol went on hunger strike to press for higher wages, a miners union spokesman said.      Victor Lopez, executive secretary of the miners union, told a news conference the strikers began to fast in the major tin mining districts of oruro and potosi and the action would spread tomorrow to la paz and other areas.      The government has charged that the strike by the miners union, crippled by massive layoffs, is part of a left-wing destabilisation plan to coincide with the visit of West German president Richard von Weizsaecker, who arrives on a four-day official tour on Friday.      But miners union chief Simon Reyes told reporters the strike had nothing to do with subversion and was to press for more government investment in Comibol.      The government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro has streamlined the deficit-ridden state mining corporation laying off about 20,000 miners, two-thirds of the workforce, following a collapse of the international tin price in 1985.  \n',25
'The tin price is likely to rise to 20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers\' accord on export quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell the metal at lower prices, a Malaysian government bulletin said.     The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers\' interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to 90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes overhang.     It said consumption by industrialised countries should stay at 160,000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditors and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively unless there is a large and abrupt price jump.     The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help push up the price of tin, the bulletin said.     A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the ringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tin cheaper in sterling terms, it added.     \"Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin market, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo,\" the bulletin said.  \n',25
'Consuming countries, chastened by the collapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price support operations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving, a survey showed.     They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords\' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts. Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses, have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.     Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey showed.     The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could do under the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the world\'s fourth largest producer, undermining the market.     The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.     A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was adopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.     Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.     Consumers and a small group of producers argued that \"objective criteria\" should be used to define export quota shares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil, the world\'s leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and, although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today, delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote.     International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements, collect statistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.     An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups, made up of governments with advice from industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.     The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to become operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet Union has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the U.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives, citing the lack of widespread support.     U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.     \"We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,\" official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts.     The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries, the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.     U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.     Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik tolds in Kuala Lumpur his country, the world\'s top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case.     Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from 70,000.     Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron tolds in London, \"Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality, if there was full participation by producers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously.\"     But Baron added, \"No real sanctions are available for a country that doesn\'t stick to its obligations...The German approach is sceptical. We don\'t think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries. They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them.\"     Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries. But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for \"intellectual honesty\" and \"objective criteria\" have grown.     British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.     It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K. Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be.     A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.     A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation, particularly regarding stocks.     Indonesia\'s Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja tolds in Jakarta: \"These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclical..But it\'s another matter when there are structural problems..But we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith.\" Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements.     \"The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work,\" Martinez Cuenca said.     The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, tolds an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries\' ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations\' capital goods.  \n',25
'Bolivia, once Latin America\'s most delinquent debtor, is preparing for a second International Monetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending.     A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Paz shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement.     He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month. The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility.     The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed, Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the next 12 months.     Bolivia\'s agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980, opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of Bolivia\'s 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt.     Central Bank President Javier Nogales tolds the negotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be finalised, had been extremely successful.     Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule Bolivia\'s debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988.     Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said.     Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.     Nogales said Bolivia\'s net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the capital flow on Bolivia\'s debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986.     Bolivia\'s return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro\'s economic stabilisation program. He inherited inflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate.     Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market- related rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations.     Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months, according to the Central Bank, and the government  expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years.     The government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest has not been paid since March, 1984.     Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would make a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market --  10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia\'s commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider the proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the country\'s creditor banks will take up the offer.     One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country.     But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated in Chile for the past two years.     The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for debt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme.     Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the government realises that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow.     Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada tolds that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years.     The government realises that in order to remain viable, Bolivia will need to develop new exports.     The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of Bolivia\'s exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets, and gas, the country\'s major revenue earner, is in abundant supply in the region.  \n',25
'A strike by 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation Comibol has paralysed tin production in the major centers of Huanuni, Corocoro, Siglo, Catavi and Colquiri, the Conflicts Secretary of the Bolivian Miners Federation, Cristobal Aranibar, tolds.      The strike began at midnight to press demands for higher wages and more funds for the nationalised mining industry.      The miners federation left the door open to negotiations with the government but \"only if the authorities show their intention to find solution to our demands\", Aranibar said.     The government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro, faced with mounting social unrest against its economic policies, has said the miners strike was part of a campaign to discredit it during the visit of West German president, Richard von Weizsaecker, who arrives today for a four-day official visit.     The government froze salaries as part of its efforts to pull Bolivia out of a deep economic crisis. According to central bank forecasts inflation will reach an annual 10 pct rate versus up to 20,000 pct in 1985.      In addition to the miners\' strike, about 1,000 railway factory workers of the bolivian labour organization (COB) began a second day of a hunger strike in the country\'s main cities to press for substantial wage increases, a union leader said.  \n',25
'Malaysian miners criticised the U.S. For violating an agreement with Southeast Asian producers by selling more stockpiled tin in 1986 than agreed.     The U.S. General Services Administration sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986, well above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes, the States of Malaya Chamber of Mines said.     In its latest annual report, it said the U.S. Had promised to limit sales of tin in a memorandum of understanding signed with the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in December 1983.     \"The U.S. Appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN Memorandum of Understanding,\" the Chamber said.     The Chamber estimated the U.S. Strategic stockpile held 180,444 tonnes of tin in December 1986, 137,744 tonnes in excess of of its original stockpile goal of 42,700.     The main ASEAN tin producers are Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which produce the bulk of the world\'s tin.  \n',25
'An extension of the International Tin Agreement (ITA) is unrealistic and the pact should be allowed to lapse, Indonesian Mines and Energy Minister Subroto told reporters.     Asked about Jakarta\'s position for the quarterly session of the International Tin Council on April 8-9, Subroto said Indonesia had agreed to the formation of a study group to look into how to replace the pact.     But he said that given the present disagreement between producers and consumers, there is unlikely to be any follow-up to the ITA.     Asked by reporters if Indonesia would support an extension of the ITA, he said, \"No one will propose that. It\'s also unrealistic to do so.\"     Subroto played a key part in securing agreement between the seven member Association of Tin Producing Countries to introduce a quota system which limited their exports and consumption to 96,000 tonnes in the year starting March 1.     Indonesia\'s quota was set at 24,516 tonnes.  \n',25

'Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today lodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its petition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC.     The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22, when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed by banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the collapse of the ITC\'s buffer stock operations in October 1985. AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal.     The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on three points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of the broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, tolds.     The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an arbitration award. AMT will contest all three points.     The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the winding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold said.     The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an arbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the court accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to enforce an arbitration ruling.     The court originally decided that the winding-up petition went wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT spokesman said.     The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but a case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be heard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a receiver appointed over the ITC\'s assets.     Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is possible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be consolidated with AMT\'s appeal, Arnold said.     Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the Council\'s member states and an application by the governments to strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11.     Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME\'s tin \"ring-out\" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the near future. The hearing date has now been put back slightly to June 8.  \n',25
'An extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement, ITA, for one or two years beyond June 30 is increasingly likely, International Tin Council, ITC, delegates said following a special council session today.     A formal decision will be taken at the quarterly council session on April 8-9 when decisions are needed on the budget and activities for the year beginning July one, they stated.     Delegates said most countries now favour a continued legal ITC presence to answer the still unresolved legal disputes over the outstanding debts of its buffer stock with court hearings likely to continue well after the June 30 expiry of the pact.     The ITC was informally told of the appeal made yesterday by Amalgamated Metal Trading Ltd, AMT, against the January court ruling against it in the legal bid it led on behalf of ITC creditor brokers to have the ITC wound up.     In January the judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the tin council, the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the U.K. Companies act, and the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect in respect of an arbitration award.

A two year extension is possible.  \n',25
'The United States defended its sales of stockpiled tin in 1986 in reaction to criticism from Malaysian miners who have said it violated an agreement with southeast Asian producers.     \"The United States has continued to abide by the spirit of the memorandum of understanding and has consulted with the ASEAN states on GSA tin disposals,\" a State Department spokesman said in a statement.     \"The views of the ASEAN governments have been taken into account in determining disposal levels,\" the statement said.     The United States and the ASEAN countries signed a memorandum of understanding concerning tin disposals by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in December 1983.     In its latest annual report, the States of Malaya Chamber of Mines said the GSA sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986, well above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes. \"The United States appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN Memorandum of Understanding,\" it said.     The State Department statement said GSA tin disposals increased in calendar year 1986 due to changed market conditions. During the first quarter of calendar year 1987, they have been running at a lower rate compared to 1986.     The spokesman declined to say how much stockpiled tin the GSA sold last year, however.  \n',25
'Zaire agreed to limit its tin exports to 1,736 tonnes for 12 months from March 1 in line with an Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) plan to curb exports, the ATPC said.     ATPC Executive Director Victor Siaahan tolds he received a telex from Zaire indicating its willingess to take part in the plan to limit total ATPC exports to 96,000 tonnes for a year from March 1.     Siaahan said Zaire is expected to produce 1,900 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987, and that in 1986 its output and exports were about 1,200 tonnes.     The ATPC hopes to cut the 70,000-tonne world surplus by 20,000 tonnes and boost prices.     All ATPC members except Zaire and Australia recently agreed to adhere to the export quotas allocated them under the plan. Australia said its quota of 7,000 tonnes was roughly equal to its expected output this year.     The ATPC consists of Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Bolivia, Australia, Nigeria and Zaire.

Rights will be traded on Australian stock exchanges from March 23 to April 22, and the new shares will be quoted from June 4.     BHP said the new company will be one of Australia\'s larger gold producers, with annual output exceeding 170,000 ounces. It said there are plans to boost production to 300,000 ounces by the early 1990s. BHPGM\'s portfolio will include several Australian mines -- 30 pct of Telfer, 100 pct of Ora Banda and Browns Creek and 20 pct of the new Boddington development.     The statement said BHPGM would also hold BHP\'s 45 pct stake in the Coronation Hill Property in the Northern Territory, and its 55 pct stake in a new venture near Gympie, Queensland.     BHPGM chairman-designate John Gough said it was a quality gold stock.     \"The diversity and depth of BHP Gold\'s portfolio ... Give the company a sound foundation in current gold production and an exciting potential for growth,\" he said.  \n',25
'Thousands of black mineworkers roared support for a union proposal to seize control of South Africa\'s gold, uranium, platinum and coal mines if the owners refuse to improve conditions for migrant black workers.     About 15,000 miners attended a rally here to endorse moves proposed by last week\'s annual meeting of the 200,000 strong National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).     They also supported a proposal for a national strike at the end of this month if the owners refused to begin negotiations.     Migrant workers from surrounding countries make up more than half of the labour force in the mines.     It was not stated how the union would \"seize control.\"     The miners\' leaders also demanded an end to the system of single sex hostels for migrant workers, to be replaced by housing schemes so that workers could live with their families.     The crowd, one of the largest to attend a meeting since South Africa declared a state of emergency last June, also shouted approval of a proposal to work closely with anti-apartheid movements such as the United Democratic Front (UDF) which claims two mln members. They also shouted their support for a demand that jailed black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela be released.  \n',25
'British Petroleum Co PLC said based on a feasibility report from Ridgeway Mining Co, its joint venture Ridgeway Project in South Carolina could start commercial gold production by mid-1988.     The company said the mine would produce approximately 158,000 ounces of gold per year over the first four full years of operation from 1989 through 1992 and at an average 133,000 ounces a year over the full projected 11 year life of the mine.     BP\'s partner is Galactic Resources Ltd of Toronto.     BP said subject to receipt of all statutory permits, finalization of financing arrangements and management and joint venture review, construction of a 15,000 short ton per day processing facility can start. Capital costs to bring the mine into production are estimated at 76 mln dlrs.  \n',25
'Canamax Resources Inc and Pacific Trans-Ocean Resources Ltd said they conditionally approved starting production at their jointly owned Ketza River gold deposit in the Yukon after a study recommended the move.     They said production was conditional on approval of a water license and arrangement of appropriate financing. They estimated development costs for the mine and mill would total 21.1 mln dlrs, including three mln dlrs of working capital.     The feasibility study anticipated gold production of 49,600 ounces a year at a cost of 129 Canadian dlrs a short ton, they said.     Canamax and Pacific Trans-Ocean said the project would yield a 40 pct after-tax real rate of return at a gold price of 400 U.S. dlrs an ounce.     They said they would mine 460,000 tonnes of proven and probable mineable reserves of oxide ore grading 0.45 ounce gold ton at a yearly rate of 112,000 tonnes for a mine life of 4.25 years.     Possible reserves of 75,000 tonnes grading 0.38 ounce gold ton at the break zone would extend mine life by a year, with considerable potential for development of further oxide ore reserves at the deposit, they said.  \n',25
'Carolin Mines Ltd said recent assays of tailings at its Hope, British Columbia mine ranged from 0.50 to 0.64 ounces of gold per ton.      There were only trace amounts of platinum and palladium, the company said.     Carolin said the results sharply disagreed with an earlier assay performed by Intergold U.S.A.

Carolin also said it expects to receive results of further tests and assays of the tailings within two to three weeks.  \n',25
'Gold output in the northeast China province of Heilongjiang rose 22.7 pct in 1986 from 1985\'s level, the New China News Agency said. It gave no figures.     It said the province, China\'s second largest gold producer after Shandong, plans to double gold output by 1990 from the 1986 level. China does not publish gold production figures.     However, industry sources estimate output at about 65 tonnes a year, with exports put between 11 and 31 tonnes.     China is selling more gold abroad to offset large trade deficits in recent years, western diplomats said.  \n',25
'Consolidated TVX Mining Corp said it agreed to issue 7.8 mln treasury shares to acquire interests in three gold mining companies in Brazil and an option to increase the company\'s interest in a platinum property.     The company said the transactions will bring immediate production and earnings to Consolidated TVX, enhance its precious metal potential and is expected to improve cash flow and earnings on a per share basis. The company did not give specific figures.     Consolidated TVX said it will acquire 29 pct of CMP, a public gold mining company in which TVX already holds a 15 pct interest, making TVX the largest single shareholder.     The company also agreed to acquire a 19 pct stake in Novo Astro, a private company, and a 16 pct interest in Teles Pires Mining, increasing the TVX\'s ownership to 51 pct.     In addition, Consolidated TVX said it will acquire the right to add a 10 pct interest to a platinum property in which it already owns a 29.4 pct stake.     CMP earned 11 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986 and expects to produce 42,000 ounces of gold in 1987 at a cost of 160 U.S. dlrs an ounce, Consolidated TVX said.     Novo Astro operates Brazil\'s richest gold mine located in Amapa State, with an average grade of 0.8 ounces of gold a ton in a hardrock quartz vein, Consolidated TVX said. Mining of eluvial surface material produced 25,000 ounces in 1986 and is expected to produce 60,000 ounces in 1987.     It also said Teles Pires Mining controls rights to a 350 kilometer section of the Teles Pires River, where one dredge is expected to produce 10,000 ounces of gold in 1987.  \n',25
'Currency fluctuations may reassert their influence on the bullion market in the near future, bullion bankers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said in a market report.     But the firm said silver may lag behind gold in any reactions to movements on foreign exchanges.     \"OPEC\'s failure to address the recent decline in oil prices remains a worrying factor however, and on balance it appears that the market should be approached cautiously,\" Montagu said.

'East Rand Proprietary Mines Ltd said that barring any major disruption in production, it expects 1987 gold output to top 10 tonnes after dropping to 9.223 tonnes last year from 10.251 in 1985.     Chairman Clive Knobbs said in the annual report the mine was expected to mill a higher tonnage while capital expenditure during 1987 will be around 118.5 mln rand.    The decline in gold production last year was due to a four pct drop in tonnage milled and a seven pct decline in grade.  \n',25
'Echo Bay Mines Ltd said it discovered a gold deposit in the Cove area near its McCoy gold mine in Nevada.     Echo Bay said it encountered gold in 39 of 42 drill holes at Cove. It said seven holes averaged 0.185 ounce gold a short ton and 1.8 ounces of silver, with the seven intersections averaging 118 feet in thickness beneath 25 feet of overburden.     The discovery is on the McCoy property, one mile northeast of the McCoy open pit, heap leach gold mine, which is expected to produce about 85,000 ounces of gold this year, Echo Bay said.  \n',25
'The public prosecutors and police here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of about 1.5 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered, police said.     The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June, 1985.     Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano\'s home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet.     The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees at its peak in early 1985.     Toyota Shoji\'s business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985, according to lawyers.     Of them, some 18,000 clients cla&#127;imed they could get back neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150 billion yen, local press reports said.     Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today included Hiroshi Ishikawa, 47, former Toyota Shoji president, and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list.     They were suspected of having collaborated with the late Nagano in swindling about 1.5 billion yen from about 450 people in Osaka and n&#127;earby Kobe during a six month period just before the firm\'s bankruptcy, they said.

'The price of gold bullion is likely to rise in the second half of the year on increased private investor demand, West German analysts said.     Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this year, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale\'s trading division, after a presentation by the U.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.     \"A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock exchanges,\" Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.     Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.     Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many investors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.     Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.     Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG\'s foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half of this year.     The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and 430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.  \n',25

'Gold is expected to continue its rise this year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in the U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.     It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries\' efforts to achieve further firming of the price has led to growing inflationary pressures in the U.S.     Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed central bank limits and real growth of their gross national products, it added.     Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank said.     Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on futures markets, has also risen, the bank said.     These factors and South Africa\'s unstable political situation, which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold supplies from that country, underscore the firmer sentiment, it said.     However, Australia\'s output is estimated to rise to 90 tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986.  \n',25

'The  Ministry of Mines has announced the discovery of a major gold field in Grand Bois in Haiti\'s mineral-rich North.     At a press conference yesterday, a Ministry spokesman reported the deposit contained an estimated 44 mln tons of ore, with each ton capable of containing 7,666 grams of gold. The spokesman gave no estimate of what he thought the find, discovered on Wednesday, was worth.     However, mining could only begin after foreign partners invest eight mln dlrs needed for technical equipment, the spokesman said.     The Haitian government has never before operated a gold mine, but the United Nations has recently completed a three year feasibility study which lists Grand Bois and Morne Bossa as sites of important gold deposits.     In 1971, the Sedren copper mine in Gonaives, operated by a Canadian firm, closed down after years of mining a concentrate containing gold as well as copper.     \"The new Grand Bois mine represents large amounts of money,\" said a former official of Sedren Mine.     \"But like everything else there\'s a catch. The gold has to be extracted, and first someone has to come up with the money to finance the operation,\" the official, who asked not to be named, tolds.  \n',25
'About 8,000 black miners returned to work after a week-long industrial action at South Africa\'s largest gold mine, mine owner Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd ANGL.J said.     A spokesman for the mining house said the action started on Wednesday last week when thousands of miners staged a go-slow at One underground shaft of the Free State Geduld division of Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd FSCN.J.     The action later escalated into an underground sit-in at the mine over the weekend, prompting management to close the affected shaft because of what the company described as \"the creation of unsafe working conditions.\"     Anglo American spokesman John Kingsley-Jones said the company held talks with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), South Africa\'s biggest trade union which claims a membership of 360,000 black workers, but failed to establish the cause of worker dissatisfaction. He acknowledged that the mine suffered a loss of production, but declined to give estimates.     Free State Consolidated last year produced 104 tonnes of gold from 28 underground shafts.     The NUM was not immediately available for comment on the action. But a spokesman for the union earlier told the South African Press Association that miners had been locked out of the mine at the weekend after staging a strike in protest against being ordered to carry bags containing explosives as well as food for white miners.  \n',25

'Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York plans an issue of 12,000 warrants for gold bullion at 425 dlrs an ounce, lead manager Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG said.     Each warrant, priced at 955 Swiss francs, entitled holders to acquire five-ounce bars of .999 gold in the period from April 30, 1987, to July 31, 1991, exercisable on Wednesdays.     The warrants represented unsecured, unsubordinated liabilities of the borrower. Payment was due April 16, and a quotation on the Luxembourg bourse was planned.     The warrants, when exercised, would be repaid in current dollars based on the value of gold on the exercise date.     The conditions represent a premium of about 145 dlrs an ounce to the current gold price.     A Morgan (Switzerland) official said that on the basis of the maturity of four years and three months, the pricing involved an implicit volatility of gold of 24.5 pct before the warrants were in the money, compared with implicit volatility of 30 pct for the Indosuez gold warrants and 26 pct for the Citibank gold warrants recent issued with maturities of 18 and 24 months.  \n',25
'A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities.     Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year.     And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character, though they are aimed at a less professional market.     The market is still small. Taken together, the four American-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss francs.     But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and predicted a lively future.     Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG said: \"The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a long-term investment in gold with limited risk.\"     Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on February 27, following it up with a second issue less than a week later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA.     The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York.     The four issues now offer investors striking prices for gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the same price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on the first one for Citibank.     The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities from 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases longer than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets.     The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to the February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a jump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation.     \"Many people are worried about inflation again,\" said Mats Joensson of Goldman Sachs. \"Money supply in Germany and the United States has grown very strongly in the last year and people want to take a ride on gold.\"     The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few weeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited.     Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in Switzerland. \"People here understand gold, and they understand warrants,\" he said.     Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of equity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares over the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed to all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage.     But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks.     The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple premiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide scientific comparisons between titles in the options market.     Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank\'s issue was competitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for five ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct.     Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue\'s long, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit volatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off, which he claimed was lower than the other issues.     But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science.     And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct.     Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm welcome from investors.     Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand, even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants apiece. \"The most sophisticated ones wouldn\'t buy these because the premiums are too high,\" he said.  \n',25

'Pyongyang and a group of Tokyo-based North Korean businessmen plan to resurrect a North Korean goldmine and boost annual output to almost one tonne within two years from 600 pounds at present, said Li Sangsu, a spokesman for Unzan Mine Development Co, the venture partner.     Work will begin on April 3 and the company aims to increase output to 10 tonnes within a decade to pay off Pyongyang\'s 70 billion yen debt to 30 Japanese companies, Li added.     \"We expect this mine to be worth about 2,000 billion yen in gold deposits,\" he said.     The mine, started in 1896 by a U.S. Company, is one of six or seven virtually untapped mines in the Unzan area, 94 miles north of Pyongyang, Li said.     Li said modern equipment and advanced technology would increase yields. \"Up to now, the mining was done with antiquated methods and basic equipment.\"     The gold mine scheme is the latest in a series of moves by North Korea to clear its debts to Japanese creditors.     Earlier this year, Pyongyang tried and failed to pay off part of its debt with several tonnes of fish.  \n',25

Between 1937 and 1955 it yielded 22.8 tonnes of gold and 7.8 tonnes of silver while milling about 30,000 tonnes of ore a month.     Placer has said the prospect has an estimated 14 mln tonnes of ore with a three-gram-per-tonne concentration accessible by open-pit mining and a further 4.5 mln tonnes with a 4.4-gram-a-tonne concentration between 300 and 600 meters underground.     It said it was obliged to produce the feasibility study no later than December 31 this year by which time it would have spent three mln dlrs on Big Bell.     If the results are positive and a commitment to develop made then construction would take about 12 months, Placer said.  \n',25
'The climate for precious metals is improving with prices benefiting from renewed inflation fears and the switching of funds from dollar and stock markets, brokers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said.     Silver prices in March gained some 15 pct in dlr terms due to a weak dollar and silver is felt to be fairly cheap relative to gold, Montagu said in its monthly silver newsletter. In March the gold/silver ratio narrowed from 74 to less than 67.     The supply/demand position has improved in the past year, and despite a silver market surplus, the quantity of silver is modest enough to be absorbed by investors, it added.     The report said the firmness in oil prices was likely to continue in the short term.     A period of consolidation might be necessary before prices attempted to move significantly higher,it said, but so long as the dollar remains under pressure then the outlook for silver was positive.     However silver was less likely to continue to outpace the other metals by such a margin, Montagu said.  \n',25
'A proposed sales tax on gold transactions could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press conference.     \"If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions, Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,\" he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would be unable to compete in the international market, he added.     \"How can the government really raise taxes if the system they impose is prohibitive of generating business?\" he said.     The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.     The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades, gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as that of jewellery and coins, dealers said.     However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.     Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986.     A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early 1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said.     Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.     While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said.     Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said.     Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito\'s reign, dealers said.     Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign participant.     Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers said.     \"All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,\" Hofer said.     \"I don\'t think it fits the philosophy of an internationalising market,\" he added.     Officials of several major Japanese trading houses, attending the press conference, said they supported Credit Suisse\'s call for the government not to impose the gold tax.  \n',25
'Gold rose by about 50 U.S. Cents an ounce, following a statement by President Ronald Reagan that the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran \"was a mistake,\" dealers said.     Bullion rose to 409.40/90 dlrs from an initial low of 408.90/409.40. This compares with the opening of 409.00/50 and New York\'s close of 410.00/50.     Dealers noted mild short-covering in the metal after some initial selling by local investors. Trading was fairly quiet this morning partly owed to the slow U.S. Dollar activities, they added.     However, Reagan\'s remarks had only a short-lived bullish impact on the gold price, which is now stabilising at 409.10/60 dlrs, dealers said.     On the local market, the metal traded in a narrow range of 3,800 and 3,805 H.K. Dlrs a tael against yesterday\'s 3,778 close.  \n',25
'Seven managers and employees at General Mining Union Corp Ltd\'s Kinross Mines Ltd will face charges of culpable homicide following last year\'s disaster when 177 gold miners died, the Attorney General\'s Office said.     The mineworkers were killed last September at Kinross when a fire set off toxic fumes which suffocated miners underground.     Three of the accused face alternative charges of breaking safety regulations set out in the Mines and Works Act.     The spokesman said the case would probably be heard in Witbank Regional Court, near Kinross, in mid-May.  \n',25
'The gold mining industry had another \"exceptional year\" in 1986 with tonnage milled, revenues and profits reaching high levels, the Chamber of Mines said.     Nearly 108 mln tons of ore was milled, three pct higher than the prior year, while revenues rose 17 pct to 16.5 billion rand and profits increased 6.5 pct to 8.31 billion rand, the Chamber reported.     The profit rise was achieved despite substantial cost increases and a 26.1 pct rise in capital expenditures to 2.42 billion rand, it said.     The chamber said that a \"comparatively buoyant gold price allowed mines to continue the practise of mining lower grade ores which has characterised recent years.\"     It said the industry now mines to an average grade of 5.63 grams per ton compared with 6.09 grams per ton in 1985.     Gold output for the year declined five pct to 638 tons compared with the previous year\'s 671 tons.  \n',25
'Sigma Mines (Quebec) Ltd, 65 pct owned by Dome Mines Ltd, said its Sigma Mine had proven and probable reserves at the end of 1986 of 4,902,940 tons, with an average grade of 0.139 ounces of gold a ton.     Sigma said the reserves are equivalent to 10 years future production at current milling rates.     The reserves comprise 1,640,779 tons proven reserves grading an average of 0.163 ounces of gold a ton and 3,262,161 tons probable reserves grading an average of 0.127 ounces of gold a ton.     Sigma said it changed its 1986 reserve reporting method following Dome Mines\' previously reported move to adopt general industry practice of reporting proven and probable ore reserves.     Prior to 1986, Sigma conservatively reported only proven reserves that could be mined without future development costs.     Proven reserves as of December 31, 1985 were 978,000 tons grading an average of 0.194 ounces of gold a ton, equivalent to about two years future production.  \n',25

'St. Joe Gold Corp said it plans to proceed with development of its Golden Patricia gold property in northwestern Ontario.     It said about five mln dlrs will be spent to continue underground development and obtain operating permits and another 10.2 mln dlrs is expected to be required to complete underground development, construct a mill and provide the infrastructure needed to put the mine into commercial production.     St. Joe Gold said if the necessary operating permits were granted in time, it would start gold production in the second half of the year ending October 31, 1988 at an annual rate of about 40,000 troy ounces.     The company said the property is estimated to contain over 500,000 troy ounces of gold, and the initial mining project covers only seven of 192 claims, with drill-indicated reserves of 293,000 short tons grading 0.88 troy ounce of gold per ton.     It said initial mine output is expected to be about 150 tons of ore daily.     St. Joe Gold said the Golden Patricia vein has not been tested at depth or along strike to the east and west and exploration is continuing on the Golden Patricia property and the adjacent wholly-owned Muskeg Lake property.     The company also said its Richmond Hill gold and silver deposit in the Carbonate district of western South Dakota has been shown by drilling to contain about 3,900,000 tons grading 0.055 troy ounce of gold and 0.23 troy ounce of silver per ton.

'American Eagle gold bullion coin sales are projected at 3.1 mln troy ounces in their first year on the market, well above the target of 2.2 mln, Donna Pope, director of the U.S. Mint, told journalists.     World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193 mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it world market leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said.     Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all gold Eagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were in Europe and about eight pct in Asia.     She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion coins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preserve the Eagle\'s strong market share with extensive publicity.     The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins, as long as this is available at market prices. The remaining gold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from the open market, Pope said.     Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition here from the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent from the South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf\'s West German market share at 60 pct.     The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buy gold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pct value-added tax imposed here. Including the tax, the one-ounce coins traded today at 906 marks, they said.     Competition may also come from new gold coins, including Belgium\'s ECU, which began sales today. Britain and Australia also have plans to mint gold bullion coins, the analysts said.  \n',25

'Australian beef output is forecast to decline to 1.34 mln tonnes carcass weight in 1987 and 1.36 mln in 1988 from 1.44 mln in 1986, the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corp (AMLC) said.     Exports of beef/veal are also predicted to decline to 480,000 tonnes shipped weight in 1987 from 515,000 in 1986, and then rally to 490,000 in 1988, the AMLC said in a summary of its bi-annual meat and livestock forecasts.     It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 level of 23.2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding is expected to be slower than previously forecast.     Beef producers are becoming more confident that higher returns in the market, both domestically and overseas, will continue, the AMLC said.     The slow herd build-up and the forecast lower production is expected to bring about a slight drop in both export and domestic consumption this year, it said.     The forecast does not assume a turnaround in production levels until late next year.     It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion of output remains much the same as last year when it was around 55 pct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct.     The increase in exports of beef as a percentage of production has mainly been attributed to the decline in the Australian dollar, the AMLC said.     It also forecast that Australia\'s four major markets, the U.S., Japan, Canada and Taiwan, will continue to dominate the chilled and frozen beef export markets. They take collectively around 94 pct of total Australian exports.  \n',25

'The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of social and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission sources said.     The ministers agreed that under this \"extensification\" scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct.     The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and wine, they added.     Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case, farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.     The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego.     The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment.     It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such allowances are available only for livestock.     The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques, the sources added.     At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers.     Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state aid would be subject to \"strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition.\"     EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production.     The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay \"early retirement\" pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production. Those who took their land completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to their heirs, would have received more generous payments.     Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed.  \n',25

'Japan\'s plan to cut beef intervention prices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boost demand because of strict supply controls and a complex distribution system, Japanese and U.S. Industry sources said.     \"Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meeting consumers\' demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal,\" a Housewives Association of Japan official said.     Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farm markets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, which maintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers.     Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbled beef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against 1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820.     The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from dairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceiling at 1,325 against 1,420.     Ministry officials said the semi-government Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operations to help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention price zone.     The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amount set by the government under a quota system. When wholesale prices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks, both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef when prices are below.     But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.     Phillip Seng, Asian Director of the U.S. Meat Export Federation, tolds the two pct cut in prices is a step toward closing the gap with European Community prices, about half those in Japan.     But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S. Meat exporters because of Japan\'s rigid and complicated distribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC.     The Housewives Association official said retail beef prices are high mainly because of distribution problems and high production costs, as well as poor operations by the LIPC.     American meat packers see Japan as a promising market. F.C. Beatty, of U.S. Packer John Morrell and Co, told the Japan Times beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound in the U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.

But industry sources said it is unclear how much demand will pick up if retail beef prices drop following any sharp reduction in intervention prices.     U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week he will ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when he visits here next month.     In 1984, Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by 9,000 tonnes a year until March 31, 1988.     In 1987/88, the quota will rise to 177,000 tonnes from 168,000 in 1986/87, ministry officials said, adding Japan wants to keep self-sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct.  \n',25
'The Agriculture Ministry is expected to reduce official intervention prices for beef and pork in 1987/88 starting in April, but the cutback ratio has not been set yet, industry sources said.     Production prices, the basis for setting intervention prices, have been falling because of declining compound feed prices due to low coarse grain import prices, they said.     Last November an advisory panel urged the government to work on reducing officially set high farm product prices to levels closer to international values, the sources added.     In Japan the government maintains a price stabilisation zone system for beef and pork to support domestic producers.     The stabilisation zone is kept by the semi-government Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) through a buffer stock operation in the wholesale market.     The 1987/88 beef and pork price stabilisation zone will be set by the end of March after an advisory panel to the Agriculture Ministry recommends the price zone at a meeting on March 25, ministry officials said. At present, the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu beef, known as marbled beef, is 1,400 yen per kilo, while its ceiling is 1,820, they said.     The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from dairy steers, is now 1,090 yen per kilo and the ceiling is 1,420, the officials said. The pork standard price is now 540 yen per kilo and the ceiling 760.     They said the domestic beef intervention price influences imported beef selling prices on the domestic market.     Japan sets an annual beef import quota. A semi-government body imports most of this and releases it to wholesalers or processors in line with the standard price of other beef categories in an attempt to avoid jeoparadising domestic beef prices, they said.  \n',25
'Japan\'s Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) said that on April 28 it will import 7,515 tonnes of beef for the first half of the 1987 fiscal year started on April 1 under the simultaneous buy and sell tender system, against 6,813 a year ago.     The system calls on the agency to buy beef from trading houses and simultaneously sell it to users in one tender. The tender quota in April-September is 10 pct of the agency\'s beef import share. Japan\'s beef import quota in 1987/88 was set at 93,000 tonnes against 85,000 for the same period in 1986/87.  \n',25
'The USDA monthly cold storage report for meats is expected to have little, if any, effect on livestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Monday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk of direction, livestock analysts said.     The increase of 66.4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the 22.6 mln lbs decline in total red meats. Fundamentals may provide most of the direction in futures on Monday, they said.     \"I think the market is going to be looking at some other things and accentuate whatever the action of cash markets might be early next week,\" Jerry Gidel, livestock analyst for GH Miller, said.     Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futures will be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hog marketings pace next week. Also, Easter ham business was completed this week and there may be less aggressive interest for pork in general next week.     \"We needed some help from the cold storage report to avert a possible setback next week in the pork complex,\" Levitt said.     Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the belly figure neutral to slightly negative. Although belly stocks were down 33 pct from last year, they exceeded the average expectation and actually showed a lighter than expected decline from last month due to an adjustment to last month\'s holdings, they said.     However, analysts noted that the amount of bellies put in storage has been light since the beginning of March and this is a potentially bullish situation.     Glenn Grimes, agronomist at the University of Missouri, said, \"I would not look for (belly) storage during the next month or two to be heavier than a year ago - I think it will be less.\"  \n',25
'Delegates to the American Pork Congress will decide whether or not they want mandatory production controls when they vote on the official pork producer policy wednesday, the National Pork Producers Council said.

'Congressmen from beef producing states and representatives of the U.S. livestock industry  urged the Reagan administration to press Japan and South Korea to open up their markets to imports of beef.     Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock issues, Rep. Hal Daub (R-Nebr.), said the administration should push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea. Daub was joined by several other lawmakers.     U.S. assistant trade representative Suzanne Earley, replied \"we\'re not going to let Japan off the hook, or Korea.\" She noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior Korean official last week on the beef issue, and that Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in April for discussions on farm trade issues.     Japan maintains a quota on beef imports, set at 58,400 tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987. South Korea has banned beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to U.S. pressure and allow some imports soon, industry officials said.     In testimony today, Tom Cook, director of industry affairs for the National Cattlemens Association said \"the Congress, administration and the industry must take a strong, tough and united stand to impress the Japanese that we mean business and that we expect them to open their markets.\"  \n',25
'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he would not agree to an extension of the 18-month whole dairy herd buyout program set to expire later this year.     Speaking at the Agriculture Department to representatives of the U.S. National Cattlemen\'s Association, Lyng said some dairymen asked the program be extended.     But he said the Reagan administration, which opposed the whole herd buyout program in the 1985 farm bill, would not agree to an extension.     The program begun in early 1986, is to be completed this summer. U.S. cattlemen bitterly opposed the scheme, complaining that increased dairy cow slaughter drove cattle prices down last year.  \n',25
'Delegates from the National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, yesterday approved programs for control and eradication of pseudorabies and establishment of a national safe drug use program.     The delegate body, attending the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis, approved a pseudorabies control and eradication program at the state level after a recommendation from NPPC\'s PRV (pseudorabies virus) oversight committee.     The PRV committee received results of a three year, five state pilot project which had a 97.5 pct success rate in eradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The project was jointly funded by the USDA and NPPC.     \"Primarily it (the program) allows individual states to deal with their own problems according to a timetable that suits them best,\" Mike Wehler, member of the NPPC\'s PRV oversight committee said.     In regards to safe drug use, the delegates approved a plan asking that NPPC be active in establishing a national safe drug use program.     The program would establish better relationships between producers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a quality assurance program in pork production, according to the plan.     \"This program basically communicates to the FDA that we are concerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugs safely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue in effect,\" Wehler said.  \n',25
'The National Pork Board announced at the American Pork Congress convention in Indianapolis that refunds under the legislative checkoff program are running less than expected.     The Board oversees collection and distribution of funds from the checkoff program that was mandated by the 1985 farm bill. Virgil Rosendale, a pork producer from Illinois and chairman of the National Pork Board, said over 2.2 mln dlrs was collected in January and refunds are running almost nine pct, considerably less than expected.     \"We believe that this indicates good producer support for the new checkoff. We\'re getting good compliance from markets, from packers and from dealers,\" Rosendale said.  \n',25
'Delegates from the National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, attending the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis, voted overwhelmingly to recommend the U.S. congress not to change the farm bill. While there are no specific pork items in that legislation, feed grain prices directly affect pork producer profits, the NPPC said.     Don Gingerich, a delegate from Iowa, said \"to have unpredictable changes come along periodically makes it very difficult to plan and causes a lot of disruption.\"     Other members said the farm bill has some imperfections but that\'s a price pork producers are willing to pay for legislative stability, an NPPC spokesman said.     Delegates also passed unanimously a resolution that Congress and the administration should act swiftly to identify problems in the farm credit system.     Farm Credit Task Force chairman and newly elected Vice President of the NPPC Ray Hankes, said delegates wanted a program that all commodity groups can work with and bring a  resolution to this problem with legislators in Washington.     Hankes added that the National Pork Producers Council will work to save farmers and keep credit available, but not to save or create any one credit system.   \n',25
'Livestock analysts expect renewed bull spreading in live cattle futures following yesterday\'s USDA 7-state cattle on feed report.     The USDA reported high placements in February, which may weigh on back months of cattle futures. Meanwhile, continued strong marketings during the month will support the April contract.     Contracts for June delivery forward could open 25 to 50 cents lower while April will likely open about steady, analysts said.     Cheap corn is still the main incentive for putting cattle on feed, according to Smith Barney livestock analyst Tom O\'Hare. \"They have no place to send the grain,\" he said.     Strong daily fundamentals may add to nearby support while the current discount of deferred months to the cash market may offset much of the effect of the report, analysts said.     \"The cash market is strong and may overshadow the report,\" said Robin Fuller, analyst for Agri Analysis. She added that even though placements came in above the average trade guess, many traders had expected high placements.     Placements are not that negative, especially since the technical correction in June and August live cattle futures since last week, GH Miller analyst Jerry Gidel said.     He said the current marketing posture will provide added support to the nearby month. Feedlot marketings have been running at a heavier than expected pace.     Chuck Levitt, analyst for Shearson Lehman said that with the number of cattle on feed down five pct at the beginning of the year, a three pct decline in marketings was expected. But the report for January showed marketings at 101 pct of a year ago and in February marketings were at 100 pct, Levitt noted.     \"So far we haven\'t seen any decline in marketings. They (feedlot operators) are marketing more cattle than they had intended for the first quarter, which is a bullish development,\" Levitt said.     Gidel also noted that marketings for the early part of March are running ahead of a year ago. Feedlots are not falling behind and are holding that 100 pct marketing pace.  \n',25

'Four U.S. meat processors have asked the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co, Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as the species from which it was derived.     For example, \"pork\" would be listed on the ingredients statement instead of \"mechanically separated pork.\"     Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat and poultry portion of the product.     Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.     Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient statement as \"mechanically separated (species),\" USDA said.     USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid using mechanically separated meat in their products because the term carries an \"unwarranted negative connotation\" in the minds of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar regulation exists for poultry products.     Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment.  \n',25

However, some New York-based aluminium traders said they believe the size of Alcoa\'s position has been exaggerated.     The possibility that Alcoa may be long call options is one factor indicating that supply tightness may worsen in the second quarter, traders said.     \"If they decide to exercise their right to buy, it would mean really squeezing the market,\" one New York trader said, noting that aluminum stocks on the London Metal Exchange were 90,500 tonnes at the end of last week.  \n',25
'Aluminium capacity expansion planned for the period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply any acceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on the scale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony Bird Associates\' 1987 Aluminium Review.     By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need to be around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mln tonnes are scheduled, Bird said.     Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 and increased imports by less developed countries.     Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate by as much as general growth, but non-socialist world consumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from 13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Bird said.     Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of change after 1973, the review said, and now they have completed this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have served them well in recent years.     In order to encourage the construction of additional smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher level.     Production costs are likely to rise again in the years ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies, according to the review.     At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-price scenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and 89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said.     Such a price development is not expected to cause any marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the pipeline for steel and copper.     In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said, as the world economy has not responded well to the opportunities offered by cheap oil.     Its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4 pct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higher in 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes.  \n',25
'Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and output of secondary metal will continue to rise, said Shearson Lehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market which details cost and demand factors.     Although primary smelting costs have declined generally in recent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offered by secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted material increasingly attractive.     It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around 550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said.     On the demand side, developments in automobiles and packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption.     Automobile production, although expected to fall this year, is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry, particularly in the U.S.     In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium to dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major economies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there is evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.     In addition to the cost savings involved, technology advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by the secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.     There is not likely to be a problem of availability as the U.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true of several European countries, albeit on a smaller scale.  \n',25
'Schweizerische Aluminium AG ALUZ.Z (Alusuisse) plans further drastic cuts in its aluminium smelting capacity and more concentration of higher value-added products, chief executive Hans Jucker said.     Elaborating on plans disclosed in outline last September, company officials said current smelting capacity of 390,000 tonnes a year would be cut to between 250,000 and 260,000 tonnes by 1989 or 1990. They did not say where cuts might be made.     Two years ago, before selling its Ormet Corp subsidiary in the United States to local management and staff, Alusuisse had an annual capacity of 800,000 tonnes.  \n',25
'Billiton International Metals B.V., the Dutch mining company, has urged Surinam to change policies it says are causing heavy losses on bauxite mining operations there, a company spokesman said.     He tolds that Billiton, a fully-owned Royal Dutch/Shell RD.AS subsidiary, presented the demands to Henk Heidweiler, a top aide to Surinam military leader Desi Bouterse, who visited the Netherlands last week for official talks.     Billiton and Suralco, owned by U.S. Conglomerate Alcoa AA.S, both want devaluation, and lower wages, welfare contributions, taxes on bauxite and energy prices.     The two firms are the biggest private sector employers in Surinam. Billiton also urged Heidweiler to improve the safety of its employees in the campaign against a jungle guerilla group, the spokesman said, adding rebel fighting since July 1986 had depressed production at Billiton and Suralco plants.     High voltage cables from the power plant of Afobakka have been cut, and a bauxite mine at Moengo has been shut, he added.     \"We are already making vast losses in Surinam and you can\'t expect any company to remain operating with losses,\" the spokesman said.  \n',25
'An unnamed Norwegian firm agreed to buy 100,000 tonnes of alumina a year from a refinery in eastern Orissa state due to start operations in the next 12 months, a Commerce Ministry official tolds.     He said the state-owned National Aluminium Co, which owns the plant, and the state-owned Mineral and Metals Trading Corp signed its first long-term export agreement with the company, but gave no further details.

'Owners of two aluminum smelters in Kentucky received temporary relief from higher electric rates after a decision Tuesday by state regulators denying a rate hike to (Big Rivers Electric Corp) of Henderson, Ky.     But the owners of the smelters, (National Southwire Aluminum Co) and Alcan Aluminium Ltd AL, said further viability of the operations would depend in part upon how the rate case is eventually settled.     \"We\'re hoping for no rate increases but we can\'t say for sure. It\'s still possible we\'ll have to close the smelter,\" a National Southwire spokesman said. He said there were other variables to consider in any decision whether to close or continue the smelter, located in Hawesville, about 60 miles west of Louisville.     National Southwire is owned by National Intergroup Inc NII, which holds about 55 pct, and (Southwire Co), which holds the rest, the spokesman said.     A spokesman for Montreal-based Alcan said, \"The decision is 48 pages long and is in legal-ese, so it certainly will be a long time before we can make a decision\" about what it means for the Sebree smelter in Henderson, about 100 miles west of Louisville. \"But we\'re delighted that Big Rivers Electric was denied the requested rate increase.\"     A spokesman for the utility, a cooperative that generates and wholesales electricity to four distributors, said the requested increase was 7.5 mln dlrs a year over 1985 rates.     The Kentucky Public Service Commission, in denying the increase, asked the utility to meet with creditors, which include Manufacturers Hanover Corp MHC and Irving Bank Corp V, and the smelters, to renegotiate a rate plan, the utility spokesman said.     The commission suggested that Big Rivers Electric work out a flexible rate schedule with the smelters that would index their electric costs to the price of aluminum, he said.     \"We have always been amenable to try, as far as we can, to assure that the two aluminum smelters remain viable,\" he said.     No meetings are scheduled and none have been planned between the utility, its creditors and the aluminum plant owners. The commission has set a hearing on the rate issue for July 28.  \n',25
'The London Metal Exchange (LME) has listed the aluminium brand \"CBA\' produced by Cia Brasileira de Aluminio at its Mairinque, Sao Paulo, plant.     The brand will constitute good delivery from April 1, the LME said.  \n',25
'The London Metal Exchange\'s, LME, decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract, with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is a positive move, physical traders and LME dealers said.     Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimum purity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1, 1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pct contract.     This is the LME\'s first dollar contract and non-European delivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking at Singapore as a delivery point for other contracts.     Trade sources said the LME\'s new contract will conform with existing industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-melt material, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded.     The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive move by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian and Japanese traders, who would be able to place metal on to warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said.     Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler with a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almost exclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be done during the sterling rings, they added.     LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the recent wide backwardations.     Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct purity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc countries, such as Romania.     The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined as an exporter recently, they said.     Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from liquidity problems initially, as business may continue to centre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where there are many holders of large short positions on the LME.     But others said the new contract would soon attract trading interest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been attracted to the LME\'s warehouses by backwardations.     The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a new contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they said.     Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like standard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract, gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process in this case may take longer, they added.     Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations, which make physical trading difficult, would not totally disappear as a result, the trade sources said.     These premiums for prompt metal have become a semi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased business and volatility in traded options, and are presently around 50 stg.     Increasingly large granting of option positions has been taking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at the end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes around these dates are commonplace, they said.     Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of having to cover.     But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even though the LME\'s new option contracts widen the gap between the declaration and prompt dates.     These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the month, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th.     Backwardations will remain while operators continue to grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds aluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said.  \n',25
'Nippon Light Metal Co Ltd NLGT.T, which has annual capacity of 63,000 tonnes, will continue primary aluminium production at a rate of 35,000 tonnes owing to low domestic and world prices and low water supplies at its hydroelectric power plant, a company official said.     Nippon, which has no plans to restore output to the 48,000 tonnes a year at which it was working until late 1986, will become Japan\'s only smelter.     Ryoka Light Metal Industries Ltd will stop smelting in April owing to high power costs and low prices, and Mitsui Aluminium Co Ltd has said it stopped smelting in February.  \n',25

'The Surinam Aluminum Company (SURALCO) registered a 75 pct drop in alumina exports in February after its operations were shut down by worker violence and guerrilla sabotage, the official Surinam News Agency, SNA, reported.     SNA said Suralco\'s alumina exports dropped to 23,869 tonnes in February from 92,852 tonnes in January. Aluminum exports, meanwhile, decreased nine pct in the same period, to 1,511 tonnes from 1,647 tonnes.     Suralco\'s alumina refinery at Paranam, 18 miles south of the capital, was shut down February 2 after workers destroyed plant and computer equipment in a protest over layoffs at the company\'s nearby aluminum smelter.     The smelter was shut down January 26 after anti-government guerrillas dynamited two electricity towers which transmit power to the plant from the Afobaka dam.     The alumina refinery, owned jointly by Suralco and Billiton NV, a Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary, was reopened March 9. But the smelter remains closed, as do the Suralco mines at Moengo, 60 miles east of Paramaribo, which were closed down by guerrillas last November.  \n',25
'The 1.4 mln tonnes capacity bauxite refinery at Paranam in Surinam, which closed at the end of January after being sabotaged by anti-government rebels, has now reopened, a spokesman for Dutch metals company Billiton said.     The refinery is run by Suralco, jointly owned by the U.S. Company Alcoa and the Dutch company Billiton, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell.     Production of alumina at the refinery is currently running at around 3,000 tonnes a day and is expected to get back to full capacity of 4,000 tonnes within a week, the Billiton spokesman added.     The refinery was forced to close at the end of January when rebels cut the main power line.     Earlier, the refinery had had to import some supplies of bauxite, as rebel activity shut off supplies from Alcoa\'s mine at Moengo in the east of the country.     Billiton\'s mine at Onverdacht, between Paranam and the capital Paramaribo, is still working but Moengo remains closed and the refinery is continuing to import some bauxite, the Billiton spokesman said.  \n',25

'Johnson and Johnson said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has notified the company its food additive petition for a high-intensity sweetener has been formally accepted and now will be reviewed by the agency.     The company said the product, with the generic name of sucralose, is made from sugar and tastes like sugar, but is about 600 times sweeter.     It yields no calories and does not promote tooth decay.     Johnson and Johnson said the sweetner is being jointly developed with Tate and Lyle PLC TATL.     Tate and Lyle is seeking approval in Canada, the United Kingdom and other European countries, Johnson and Johnson said. The company noted its petition covering the product and its safety evaluation were submitted to the FDA last month.     While awaiting FDA approval, the company said, it is proceeding with plans for commercialization through its McNeil Specialty Products Co subsidiary.     Johnson and Johnson said it is operating under a licensing agreement with Tate and Lyle, whose collaborative research with scientists at Queen Elizabeth College in London led to the discovery of Sucralose in 1976.     Patents and licensing agreements control the use of sucralose through the year 2001, Johnson and Johnson said.     Sucralose is a chlorinated derivative of ordinary sugar. The carbon-chloride bonds in sucralose are stable and are not broken during digestion or metabolism.     Sucralose is essentially not metabollized by the body. The chlorine content enhances sweetness without providing calories.  \n',25

'Dry areas of the Australian sugar cane belt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enough rain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar Producers Association spokesman said.     The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are needed in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackay regions, he said from Brisbane.     Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the state and in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking very good after heavy falls this month, he said.     The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, which is harvested from around June to December.     He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are short of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need about three days of the region\'s heavy tropical rains to restore normal moisture to the cane.     But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial to the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said.     \"It\'s certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it might be in a month without some good falls,\" he said.  \n',25

'French sugar producer Beghin-Say is not currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into intervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at this week\'s European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-Say President Jean-Marc Vernes tolds.     The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos on Wednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders.     Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has started to move in the right direction, but said his company had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into intervention.     But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final agreement would be reached with the commission which would allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention.     European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are too low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the commission on Wednesday, according to commission sources.     Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before payment is made for it.     A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, trade sources said here. This amount represents about a third of annual EC exports to non-EC countries.     Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had offered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000 tonnes.     Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus on every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully bridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday\'s rebate was 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traders said.     Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to the full intervention price and said Wednesday\'s tender was a step in the right direction.     Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised for export since the begining of the current campaign had been inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate.     Trade sources said new regulations governing export rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the path for the commission to award larger export rebates in future.     One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed the commission had understood the protest action and was now moving towards adapting the situation accordingly, thereby allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from intervention once they got satisfaction.  \n',25
'A plan by European producers to sell 854,000 tonnes of sugar to European Community intervention stocks still stands, Andrea Minguzzi, an official at French sugar producer Beghin-Say, said.     Last week Beghin-Say president Jean-Marc Vernes said a possible settlement of a row with the EC would lead producers to withdraw their offer, which was made as a protest against EC export licensing policies.     The EC policy is to offer export rebates, which fail to give producers an equivalent price to that which they would get by offering sugar into intervention stocks, Vernes said.     But Minguzzi said the offer was a commercial affair and that producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offer already lodged with intervention boards of different European countries. He said final quality approval for all the sugar offered could come later this week. Some 95 pct had already cleared quality specifications.     The EC can only reject an offer to sell into intervention stocks on quality grounds. Minguzzi added that under EC regulations, the Community has until early May to pay for the sugar. He declined to put an exact figure on the amount of sugar offered by Beghin-Say, but said it was below 500,000 tonnes.  \n',25
'A settlement could soon be reached in the dispute between European sugar producers and the European Community over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes, president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leading the protest, told journalists today.     \"Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days indicate that we are moving towards a solution,\" he said, adding that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000 tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention.     Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of sugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC\'s policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into EC intervention.     At last week\'s tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed, compared with the previous week\'s rebate which was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.     Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the producers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed the long-term desire of producers to export to the world market, providing they were not losing money by doing so.     Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April 1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, or at any time over the following five weeks before the official payment date.     The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers.  \n',25
'Drilling of this year\'s British sugar beet crop got off to a slow start due to poor weather conditions with only around one pct sown so far, a spokesman for British Sugar Plc said.     This compares with two pct at the same stage last year, three pct in 1985 and 38 to 39 pct in 1984.     There is little cause for concern with better weather forecast and the capacity available to drill the contracted area of around 200,000 hectares in about 10 days. Seed beds look good and farmers are advised to wait for soil temperatures to rise, the spokesman said.     \"If the crop can be drilled by the third week in April we will be delighted,\" he said. Last year a large proportion of the crop was not drilled until May but it still turned out to be the equal second largest on record.  \n',25
'China has to decide if it will increase sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and rising demand, in view of market predictions that international sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the official press said.     He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in production last year but he gave no price details.     One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly because of improving living standards and rising demand for sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods.     \"It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a state-controlled economy. China may have to import,\" he said.     Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in 1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in January 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986.     The official Economic Information newspaper last month said production in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April) will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand.     The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24 mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes.     \"In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped and cannot meet demand that is rising every day,\" it said.     \"The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw down stocks to meet market demand,\" it added.     It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them.     The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane.     Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said.     In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills\' profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added.     The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing money. China has 521 sugar mills.     A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct in Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of China\'s sugar in calendar 1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of China\'s sugar in calendar 1985.     He said both provinces are more developed than other sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities.     But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87, because cane-growing is more economic there, he said.     He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986.     A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end-January. \"Now they are falling but (they) have not reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,\" he said.     \"China has options not easily available in western countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly,\" he said.     The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are likely to continue until at least end-1988.     He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-owned mills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers.     \"Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many of them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s,\" he said.

'China\'s 1986/87 sugar crop has been revised to 5.26 mln tonnes (raw value), down four pct from the previous forecast and five pct below the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its World Production and Trade Report, the department attributed the decline to relatively poor profitability of sugar, causing harvested area of cane and beets to decline seven pct from 1985/86.     Beet sugar production for 1986/87 is now estimated at 837,000 tonnes, five pct less than earlier forecast and down five pct from the previous season, while cane output is projected at 4.423 mln tonnes, down four pct from previously forecast and five pct below the previous season, it said.  \n',25

'Costa Rica has agreed to sell more than 32,000 tonnes of sugar this year to the Soviet Union, a spokesman for local producers said.      Miguel Alfaro, president of the agricultural league of the sugar cane industry, said the sale follows a recent 50 pct cut in Costa Rica\'s quota for sugar exports to the U.S.     Alfaro said up to 45,000 tonnes of sugar could be exported to the Soviet Union this year under the deal, which is similar to one the Soviets made recently with the Dominican Republic.     A Soviet ship will load 25,000 tonnes at the Pacific port of Punta Morales Monday, Alfaro said, and a second ship will take an additional 7,107 tonnes two days later.     Alfaro and other industry sources declined to disclose the price at which the sugar was sold.  \n',25
'Cuban president Fidel Castro told a Congress of the Union of Young Communists here that the production of crude sugar during the harvest still in progress is 800,000 tonnes behind schedule.     In a speech Sunday, published in today\'s official paper GRANMA, Castro said unseasonable rains since January seriously interrupted harvesting and milling operations especially in the central and western parts of the island.     The Cuban leader said the mechanical cane harvesters scheduled to cut over 60 pct of the cane this year were particularly \"vulnerable,\" as muddy fields prevent operations.     Neither Castro nor the Cuban press have given out figures to estimate tonnes of crude production during the present harvest or the goals for the sugar campaign.     However, a cuban sugar official tolds that the country will be lucky if crude output reaches last year\'s 7.2 mln tonnes. Output of crude for the previous 1984-85 harvest was 8.2 mln tonnes.     The harvest was scheduled to end April 30 but due to the present shortfalls it will be extended into May and June, the official said.  \n',25
'Cuban sugar export figures for January suggest that this year\'s crop may be at least as large as last year\'s 7.35 mln tonnes, according to sugar analysts.     Exports in January totalled 733,000 tonnes raw value, up from 725,000 a year earlier, according to figures received by the International Sugar Organization.     January is the first major export month and the figures thus give a good indication of the current crop, they said. Fourth quarter exports fell to 622,000 tonnes from 909,000 tonnes a year earlier, but this was because Cuba was destocking at the end of 1985, they added.     Trade house C Czarnikow recently estimated production this year at 7.50 mln tonnes.     Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was 12,000 tonnes, giving a final 1985/86 crop total of 7.35 mln tonnes, compared with a 1984/85 crop of 8.10 mln tonnes.     There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba, but a hurricane meant that last year\'s crop was extended.     Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at 362,000 tonnes from 489,000 in January 1986, but other Comecon countries received 210,000 tonnes, against 80,000 tonnes in the same month last year, figures received by the ISO show.     Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania all took substantially more Cuban sugar.     Cuba\'s November 1986 exports totalled 158,000 tonnes, compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985, and December\'s total was 237,000 tonnes, down from 518,000 tonnes the year before. Calendar year exports for 1986 were also lower at 6.69 mln tonnes against 7.21 mln in 1985 -- the lowest level since 1980\'s 6.19 mln tonnes, the figures show.  \n',25
'Cuba has told international sugar operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that these contracts will take second place to Cuba\'s direct shipments to its export markets, dealers here said.     Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts.     The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil\'s export availability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said.     Traders said signs of Cuba\'s shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month.     Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery, and last month\'s spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes.     Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets, traders said.  \n',25
'Cuban sugar output this season (1986/87) is put at around 7.5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C.Czarnikow in its monthly sugar market review.     Allowing for around 700,000 tonnes for the current year\'s domestic usage it would leave around 6.8 mln tonnes for export of which, Czarnikow estimates, about 3.7 mln tonnes will be taken by the USSR, 1.530 mln by other socialist countries and the remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations.     Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75 mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln imports from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export needs of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes to be acquired from the world market. Soviet purchases to date may not be far short of that quantity, Czarnikow said.  \n',25
'European sugar output on the basis of three year average yields will be over half a mln tonnes white value down on last year although yields do vary widely from year to year, broker C Czarnikow said in its market review.     European Community sowings are likely to be down compared with last year. There have been suggestions these sowings might respond to the recent upsurge in world prices, but Czarnikow said \"it is not the sort of fact that easily becomes known.\"     The broker bases its forecasts on Licht planting estimates which put W Germany, the Netherlands and USSR lower but Hungary, Romania, Poland, Turkey and Yugoslavia higher.

'Dutch sugar traders deny involvement in a plan to offer more than 850,000 tonnes of sugar to intervention in protest at EC export policy and prices, traders tolds.     Although some 2,500 tonnes of sugar have been offered to intervention in the Netherlands, Dutch producers and traders said this sugar was actually Belgian and was being offered by the Belgian industry.     \"We sympathise with the actions of the French, West German and Belgian traders and producers, but we are not party to it,\" a spokesman said.     EC Commission sources said yesterday French traders planned to sell 775,000 tonnes into intervention stocks, West German traders 75,000 tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500. Dutch trade sources gave the same figure for France, but estimated up to 110,000 tonnes offered by German traders and producers.     The Dutch spokesman added, \"The weekly export tender policy and prices are squeezing the European sugar industry, and this is the only way in which they can really register their protest.     \"These are desperate actions, but we believe that most of this offered sugar will be withdrawn within the three-week breathing space allowed.\"  \n',25
'The European Community (EC) Commission declined to give an official reaction to reports that a group of european operators plan to offer one mln tonnes of sugar into intervention in protest at Commission export policies.     However, a spokesman for the Commission confirmed the offers had been made to intervention agencies in various member states, and said it would now take up to three weeks for the agencies concerned to complete all necessary documentation.     The spokesman said that under current regulations, the EC would have to accept all the offers if there were no technical problems.     The spokesman said the Commission would only have to reimburse the member state for the cost of buying-in the sugar after the product was sold out of intervention stores at a later date.     He said that at present there was virtually no sugar held in intervention stores.     Last year, 45,000 tonnes were sold into intervention and during the 1984-85 campaign 108,000 tonnes.  \n',25
'The European Community Commission confirmed it granted export licences for 59,000 tonnes of current series white sugar at a maximum export rebate of 45.678 European Currency Units (ECUs) per 100 kilos.

'The European Community Commission has told EC member states that it is not prepared to discuss EC sugar prices while sugar traders threaten to make a huge sale into intervention stocks to protest against its policies, Commission sources said.     \"Our position is that we are not willing to discuss the problems of market prices at a time when traders are making threats,\" one source said.     The sources said the Commission\'s view was made clear at a meeting of its sugar management committee today.     They said French, West German and Dutch officials had informed the committee that traders in their countries intended to sell just over 850,000 tonnes of sugar into EC intervention stocks.     The Commission riposted by signalling that it would sell the sugar sold into intervention back onto the EC market by tender, a move that would push down prices.     The sources said French traders planned to sell 775,000 tonnes into intervention stocks, West German traders 7,500 tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500.  \n',25
'Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review.     The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the intervention price, with detrimental consequences for producers\' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar.     The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time limit on storage contracts, which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September, Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced.     If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price, the extra costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says.     The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy, Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules.     The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price, Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commission\'s hand.     In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price, West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the \"green\" mark.     Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is not expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to traders for some years that the EC\'s export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, it says.     The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says, suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of \"unnecessary bureaucracy\" surrounding the export tender system.  \n',25

'The maximum rebate granted at yesterday\'s European Community (EC) sugar tender marked no change in policy towards producers\' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the EC, EC commission sources said.     They said this was despite the fact that the commission accepted over 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention yesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being set too low.     The maximum rebate at yesterday\'s tender was 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos, up from 45.678 Ecus the previous week.     London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largest ever granted. The commission sources said today the increase was entirely explained by world market conditions. The amount by which the rebate fell short of what producers claim is needed to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention remained at 0.87 Ecus per 100 kilos, they said.     Operators offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention last month to protest at rebates which they said were too low. The sources said about 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted, the remainder being rejected as of too low quality.     The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offers in the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar and payment for it.     They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet, adding that they would expect operators to wait another week or two to review commission policy before making up their minds.     The sources said the commission felt entitled to offer rebates at slightly below the level theoretically justifiable in the light of its 1987/88 farm price package proposal to reduce guaranteed prices for sugar by two pct from the start of the new season in July.  \n',25
'The rebate granted at yesterday\'s EC sugar tender represents some concession to producers\' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc, EC Commission officials said.     The maximum rebate of 44.819 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 1.3 Ecus below what producers say is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention.     The rebate at last week\'s tender was 2.5 Ecus per 100 kilos short of the level producers said was needed, the officials said.     The officials said the Commission is not negotiating with producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar for sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade it to offer higher rebates.     They said the French and German producers involved are now unable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores.     Payment for it is due five weeks later, and it will be open to them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1 and the official payment date when the Commission officially takes ownership of the sugar, the officials said.     The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar, it is determined to immediately resell it, a move which would drive down market prices further.     They expressed some hope that the operators would not eventually go through with their plan for intervention sales.     \"We think they realise they have gone too far,\" one official said.  \n',25

But the sources said producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximum rebates have given no formal indication to the Commission that they intend to withdraw these offers.     The French and German operators involved would be able to withdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores.     The five-week period is the normal delay between sugar going into intervention and payment being made for it.

'European sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year, despite recent firmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said.     A survey of planting intentions showed that while, so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower areas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations.     Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F. O. Licht.     Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this. In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons.     Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so-called \"C\" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, which receive full and partial price support, respectively.     Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output.     Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices.     However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point, this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, they added.     In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year\'s 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year.     \"The basic trend is towards stability,\" a FIRS spokesman said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output last year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00 tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11.     In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans, since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average.     Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year.     British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year\'s crop equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes.     British Sugar has \"A\" and \"B\" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes of whites and its \"C\" output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease-resistant seed types.     Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level.     The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put plantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in 1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes.     World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market, an official at the national beet growers\' association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year\'s 270,000 ha, especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya.     Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar.     Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a record 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes into force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest Dutch sugar processor, said.     The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of \"C\" sugar. Last year, the Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined \"A\" and \"B\" quota of only 872,000 tonnes.     \"The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of \"C\" sugar really worthwhile,\" the spokesman said.     Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year\'s Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year.     Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some 95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand.     The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year.     A spokesman for Denmark\'s largest beet concern, De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha.     In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha against 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB.     Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down from 37,600 in 1986.  \n',25
'The National Farmers Union, NFU, remains concerned about the future ownership of British Sugar despite last week\'s decision by the government to block bids from Italy\'s Gruppo Ferruzzi and Britain\'s Tate &amp; Lyle Plc.     The union\'s sugar beet committee met yesterday to consider the implications of a government Monopolies and Merger Commission, MMC, report issued last week. \"We are still concerned about S and W Berisford being long-term owners of British Sugar,\" a spokesman said. \"We do not view Berisford as providing the long-term stability we want.\"     The Trade and Industry Secretary accepted a recommendation last week by the MMC that it block a bid by Tate and Lyle for S and W Berisford Plc and stop Gruppo Ferruzzi buying a majority of British Sugar, owned by Berisford.     Union officials believe a new bid for the monopoly beet processor is now likely. \"We are looking again at the undertakings that we have demanded of existing bidders and which we would seek of any future bidders,\" the spokesman said. The NFU, which represents Britain\'s 11,500 sugar beet growers, is also taking legal advice on particular paragraphs in the MMC report which it says need further explanation.  \n',25

That tender originally only sought two to three cargoes but resulted in the sale of eight.

This brings recent options India has given traders to some 200,000 tonnes at fixed prices and makes future Indian purchases very dependent on price fluctuations, traders said.     At 233 dlrs CIF the sugar sold this week was at a discount of up to 10 dlrs to current prices, some traders said.  \n',25
'India bought up to 10 cargoes of white sugar at a buying tender today which originally called for just two to three cargoes of March/April shipment, traders said.     London trader E D and F Man said it sold two cargoes at 233 dlrs a tonne CIF for March/April shipment with an option to sell an additional two cargoes at the same price.     Traders said at least one other international trader made a similar contract while a French house sold two cargoes at an outright price of 233 dlrs CIF without the option. This brought total Indian purchases to at least six cargoes with traders having options to sell another four.  \n',25
'India yesterday bought two cargoes of white sugar from London traders for April/May shipment and granted the trade houses the option to sell an additional two cargoes at the same price for May/June shipment, the firms involved said.     E D and F Man and Woodhouse, Drake and Carey both said they sold single cargoes at 237.35 dlrs a tonne cif for April/May and were granted options to sell an extra cargo each at the same price for May/June at the Indian buying tender for three to four cargoes of whites held yesterday. The tender had called for a single cargo of prompt and two to three cargoes of April/May.  \n',25
'India is reported to have bought two white sugar cargoes for April/May shipment at its tender today near 227 dlrs a tonne cost and freight and could be seeking a third cargo, traders said.     A British operator is believed to have sold one of the cargoes, while an Austrian concern is thought to have featured in the second cargo sale, they said.  \n',25

'India\'s sugar output to January 31 in the 1986/87 season (October/September) rose to 3.66 mln tonnes from 3.46 mln in the same 1985/86 period, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said.     Total offtake in the first four months of the current year was 2.71 mln tonnes (including 241,000 tonnes imported) for domestic use and 4,000 tonnes for export, against 2.81 mln tonnes (including 993,000 imported) for domestic use and 3,000 tonnes for export in the corresponding period of 1985/86.     Factory stocks at end-January were 3.05 mln tonnes (96,000 imported) against 3.13 mln (96,000 imported) a year earlier.  \n',25
'Indonesian sugar output is forecast by the government to reach 2.126 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 against projected consumption of 2.039 mln tonnes, Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi said.     Production in 1986, when Indonesia was forced to import sugar, is officially estimated at 2.016 mln tonnes against 1.728 mln in 1985.     The U.S. Embassy said in its annual Agriculture Report on Indonesia there were growing signs that actual output was lower than official figures. It estimated 1986 production at 1.8 mln tonnes and forecast little change for 1987.     Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar towards the end of last year and in early 1987 to boost low stocks.     Affandi told reporters stocks fe&#127;l to as low as 159,000 tonnes at the beginning of 1987. Industry sources said this represented under one month\'s consumption.     The minister said Indonesia should hold three months\' supply, or 510,000 tonnes.     A spokesman for the National Logistics Bureau, which distributes and stores sugar, said stocks this month were 489,437 tonnes. The harvesting season begins in April.  \n',25
'Indonesia\'s raw sugar output is likely to be 1.8 mln tonnes in calendar 1987, unchanged from 1986 and below the government\'s 1987 forecast of 2.5 mln, the U.S. Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987.     Indonesia bought 162,500 tonnes of raw sugar on world markets in late 1986, the report said.     The embassy estimated Indonesia\'s calendar 1986 raw sugar production at 1.8 mln tonnes, against a government estimate of 1.99 mln.     It said that Indonesia\'s move into sugar self-sufficiency in 1984 may have been short-lived.     The report said, \"The government continues to promote sugarcane production through its smallholder intensification program and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcane producers.     \"However, there are considerable indications that farmers are reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is not as good as that of other crops.\"  \n',25
'The International Sugar Agreement (ISA) will be renegotiated, International Sugar Organization (ISO) officer in charge Constantin Politoff tolds after a special session of the pact\'s council.     A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO six monthly session in May. The alternatives are between an autumn London conference for another pact without economic clauses, but a different voting and budgetary structure, or a Geneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economic clauses, he said.     But delegates said the latter would only be considered if the world\'s four major exporters -- Australia, Brazil, Cuba and the European Community -- can resolve differences over how prices can best be supported and how to share the world     Today\'s special session was called because the U.S. earlier indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of the ISO budget.     At today\'s council session Politoff said the U.S. would try and find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg later this year. Currently, about three quarters of this year\'s ISO 800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the U.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full contribution in the last year of the current pact.     The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO budget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importers and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the importer half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a single category of members who would all share the costs pro rata to their share of world sugar trade.     The ISO executive committee next meets on April 23 with the next full council session in the week of May 19.     There are 12 importing and 44 exporting members of the ISO.  \n',25
'The Agriculture Ministry said it revised its April-June sugar consumption estimate down to 623,300 tonnes on a refined basis, from 637,800 estimated at the end of December.     It said the estimate for domestically produced sugar supply for the same period was revised to 190,400 tonnes from the earlier estimate of 195,100 tonnes, while imports were revised to 402,000 tonnes from the earlier 435,800 tonnes.     It did not revise its sugar consumption estimate of 2.53 mln tonnes for the 1986/87 sugar year ending September 30.     The ministry said the estimate for the 1986/87 year\'s supply of domestically produced sugar was revised to 881,000 tonnes, from the earlier estimate of 863,000.

'The overall area devoted to sugar beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22 mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986, West German statistician F.O. Licht said.     It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year, Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal.     The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986.     The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha, against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln.     Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares (with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114 (118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44), Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138), Portugal 1 (1), Spain 192 (190), U.K. 200 (201), West Germany 385 (399), Austria 32 (28), Finland 30 (31), Sweden 51 (52), Switzerland 15 (14), Turkey 355 (340), Yugoslavia 160 (136).     Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows, USSR 3400 (3440), Albania 10 (9), Bulgaria 52 (50), Czechoslovakia 195 (196), East Germany 210 (205), Hungary 108 (96), Poland 460 (440), Romania 295 (280).     On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mln tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987/88.     Based on average yields, EC beet sugar production could fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln in 1986/87, while total Western Europe production could be 16.9 mln tonnes against 18.1 mln. Eastern Europe production could be 12.9 mln tonnes against 13.3 mln in 1986/87.  \n',25

'Raw sugar futures had a quiet opening call of 38 lots with prices holding steady from last night with gains of 20 to 80 cents a tonne, dealers said.     Aug was trading at 157.60 dlrs from 157.40 asked yesterday.     The modest rise continued the recent rally from an oversold situation but, dealers noted, there was little fresh physicals news to stimulate activity.

'Raw sugar futures firmed to session highs by midmorning, securing gains from last night\'s basically steady close of 1.00 to 1.80 dlrs a tonne in a 166 lot volume.     Shortcovering against an oversold situation continued to play a part in the extended rally with unsettled dollar rates versus sterling providing additional support.     Recent and prospective whites buying in the world market was supportive but the raws section lacked feature, dealers said.

'The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE) will start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn syrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.     Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange expects contract approval at CFTC\'s Tuesday meeting. It has been under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in December, 1985.     The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of 55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank truck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet milling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most commonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other beverages.     Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production facilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated by the symbol \"HF,\" would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months traded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of March, May, July, September and December.     Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a minimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation of one dlr per CWT.     \"We hope the producers and users of fructose will be actively involved, those producers being the large processors, the corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage bottlers,\" Henderson said. \"But there are potentials for all types of people to use it. There is quite a list of industries that utilize fructose.\"  \n',25

Ricart, currently the Dominican Republic\'s ambassador to Austria, the Netherlands and the UN in Geneva, said he will visit the four major exporters - Australia, Brazil, Cuba and the European Community - to talk to governments and producers and find out about problems that are preventing these countries finding common ground for a new sugar pact.  \n',25
'Taiwan is not expected to export sugar this year because of falling production and growing domestic consumption, state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp said.     A company spokesman tolds this will be the first time in more than 40 years Taiwan has not exported sugar. Last year, sugar exports totalled 149,755 tonnes.     He said the actual production during the 1986/87 season (November/May) is about 480,000 tonnes, barely enough to meet local consumption. This compares with actual 1985/86 output of 570,000. He said the production fall was due to typhoon damage to more than 6,000 hectares of canefields last year.  \n',25
'Trade house sources said China is expected to step up its sugar purchases following yesterday\'s steep drop in world sugar prices.     The consensus is that the Chinese will buy between 200,000 and 400,000 tonnes of raw sugar.     \"China is short of foreign exchange and a drop in prices is usually taken as a buying opportunity by Peking,\" one trader said.     Yesterday, prices on the New York world sugar market plummeted by 0.58 to 0.50 cent on heavy liquidation by speculators, disenchanted over the market\'s lack of rallying power.

'Philippine sugar production in the 1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes, up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.     Yulo tolds a survey during the current milling season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate would almost certainly be met.     He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would be earmarked for domestic consumption.     Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and 50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.     He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.     \"The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by July,\" Yulo said.     Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil import bill by about 300 mln pesos.     Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.     The ethanol project would result in employment for about 100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.     Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had been submitted to President Corazon Aquino.     \"I think the President would rather wait till the new Congress convenes after the May elections,\" he said. \"But there is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing just slightly over our own consumption level.\"     \"The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,\" Yulo said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos per picul, up from 190 pesos last August.     Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation following the SRA\'s bid to control production.     \"We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,\" he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and cloth production.     He said diversification into products other than ethanol was also possible within the sugar industry.     \"The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,\" Yulo said. \"They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to call this a \'sugarcane industry\' instead of the sugar industry.\"     He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.     \"When you cut sugarcane you don\'t even have to produce sugar,\" he said.     Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.     \"As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new agreement which would revive world prices,\" Yulo said.     \"If there is no agreement world prices will always be depressed, particularly because the European Community is subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.\"     He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60 cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.     \"If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end of this year,\" he said.     Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by 1990, with world consumption outstripping production.     He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.     \"But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,\" he said. \"Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut ours in half without any justification.\"     Manila was keenly watching Washington\'s moves to cut domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.     The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its 12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to 143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.     Yulo said despite next year\'s increased production target, some Philippine mills were expected to shut down.     \"At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the 1986/87 season,\" he said. \"We expect two or three more to follow suit during the next season.\"  \n',25
'The Philippines will ask the U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) to increase its 1987 sugar import quota following market reports that Taiwan will not be able to fulfil its quota, Sugar Regulation Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenim Yulo said.     Yulo tolds the SRA would also protest a USDA move to award Taiwan\'s shortfall to the Dominican Republic.     The Dominican Republic already has a larger sugar quota, Yulo said. \"Any Taiwanese shortfall should be awarded to the Philippines or at the least we should share a hike with the Dominican Republic.\"     The USDA last December listed 1987 sugar import quota allocations for the Dominican Republic at 160,160 short tons and for Taiwan at 10,920 short tons.     The Philippines has said it was badly hit by a cut in its quota to 143,780 short tons from 231,660 in 1986.  \n',25
'The recent fall in world sugar prices, due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said.     Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly market report.    \"And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for May/June shipment, Man added.     The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said.     Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5 mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being countered by a reduction in China\'s production forecast to 5.3 mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.     Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could be close to last year\'s 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.     Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates Cuba\'s export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln tonnes.     However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters with reduced availability, Man said.     Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which has left exporters chasing falling import requirements.     A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still overhanging the market, Man said.     The increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency.     As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.     Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully compensate producers when exporting on the world market.     Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar is expected to remain in intervention, it added.  \n',25
'The Food Department will no longer import sugar from April 1, senior officials of the Food and Cooperatives Ministry and the Department tolds.     They said the decision was taken after the Sugar Importers Association asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised.     \"The Food Department will cease trading in sugar and will no longer hold a buffer stock,\" a senior official said.     He said the government has finalised an agreement with E.D.F.Man (Sugar) Ltd under which E.D.F.Man will hold a buffer stock on the government\'s behalf of 20,000 tonnes, against the 45,000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the Department.     Officials said the size of the buffer stock has been reduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks.     The agreement with E.D.F. Man includes details such as trigger pricing mechanisms, they said.     Four months ago the Department allowed the private sector to import sugar without government clearance. The Department and the private sector each imported around 115,000 tonnes of sugar last year, when national consumption was 280,000 tonnes.     An Importers Association official said that \"even if the Department no longer imports sugar, we would not necessarily buy more.\"     This is because the Association would still have to compete with the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment (CWE), he said.     The CWE is a semi-government body and the official said arrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holders of food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it, starting April 1.     Ministry officials said the CWE can either import sugar or buy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by E.D.F. For the past two years.  \n',25
'Reports the Soviet Union has lately extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said.     The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India, Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China.     Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added.     Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling Thai origin sugar.     Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block enquiries by China, they said.     Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts previously, they added.     Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement this year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some 1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said.     Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000 tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of two to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost and freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyer this week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an undisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around 229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added.     Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyer physicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emerged recently when prices took an interim technical dip, traders said.     Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes of whites although traders said the tender, originally scheduled for tomorrow, might not take place until a week later.     Egypt will be seeking 20,000 tonnes of May arrival white sugar next week, while Greece has called an internal EC tender for 40,000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April, for arrival in four equal parts in May, June, July and August.  \n',25
'The 2,500 tonnes of sugar offered to intervention in the Netherlands has been refused by the intervention board because of wrong packaging, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Agriculture said.     She said the sugar could be offered again to intervention.     EC producers have threatened to sell over 800,000 tonnes of sugar to intervention stocks as a protest against EC export licensing policies.     Last month Dutch traders said the sugar on offer in the Netherlands was Belgian, but the ministry could not confirm this.  \n',25
'Latin American sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production, official and trade sources said.     Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S. Cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the region\'s nine to ten cents per lb average production cost.     The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA), tolds.     However, Rico said, it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output.     \"Producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable,\" he said.     Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.     \"The prices are ridiculous,\" said Julian Mateo, vice president of Costa Rica\'s Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural League. \"At current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production.\"     Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output, given the instability of world markets.     An official at Colombia\'s National Association of Sugar Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets. \"The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything.\"     In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are available, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln tonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A year earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000 more, according to the London-based International Sugar Organization.     Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover.     Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic\'s National Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply.     Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from 900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output, he added.     Plans of nearby Cuba, the world\'s largest cane sugar exporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is running well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.     Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices, since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries under special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its troubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in 1985.     The low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean countries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which they receive prices well above free market levels.     Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market.     Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In both 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year its quota is only 37,000.     A national cooperative official said that, as long as world market levels continue at around half of Peru\'s production cost, the future of the industry is uncertain.     At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which, according to the group\'s executive-secretary Eduardo Latorre, \"grows like a weed\" throughout the region.     Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240 mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.     The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol Institute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.     Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in 1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace.     Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles.     However, the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.     Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little hope for the region\'s sugar industry to return to profitability unless the U.S. And EC change their policies.     \"The agricultural policies of the European Community and of the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets, by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries,\" Brazil\'s Trade and Industry Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA meeting.     The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the main cause of low prices.     GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region\'s industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement would have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact.     \"They have to realise that the more our economies suffer, the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the region\'s 360 billion dollar foreign debt,\" GEPLACEA\'s Latorre said.  \n',25

'London traders say the European Community is likely to award a maximum rebate of 46.80 European currency units per 100 kilos at today\'s tender, while traders in Paris predict a maximum award of 46.40 Ecus.     Last week the EC awarded licences for 59,000 tonnes at a rebate of 45.678 Ecus.     Trade views differed on the amount of sugar likely to be released today.     London traders said the EC Commission will probably endeavour to release a large tonnage, and as much as  100,000 tonnes may be authorised for export under licences up to end-September.     Paris traders put the likely tonnage at around 60,000.   \n',25

'Thai sugar production continued at a high level in February, latest figures received by the International Sugar Organization (ISO) show.     The figures show stocks at end-February of 2.49 mln tonnes raw value against 2.33 mln a year earlier. Analysts said this was a new peak for the date.     Production in February was 961,000 tonnes against 888,000 in February 1986 and took the Nov/Feb total for the current crop to 2.25 mln tonnes. Production normally tails off sharply after March, but in recent years production from March to the end of the crop has been over 500,000 tonnes, analysts said.     Thailand\'s exports in February were 32,800 tonnes and consumption 57,800.     Last month the Thai Agriculture Ministry said 1986/87 production was expected to fall to 2.3 mln tonnes from 2.48 mln in 1985/86.  \n',25
'Thai sugar production totalled 960,788 tonnes in January, an increase of 12.7 pct on January 1986, according to figures received by the International Sugar Organization.     November and December production figures also exceeded last year\'s totals with the result that output in the first three months of the season showed a 23.1 pct increase over 1985/86. Production in the November 1986 to January 1987 period totalled 1.29 mln tonnes.     Thai exports in December and January were down, however. January exports fell from 73,164 to 35,910 tonnes.     Domestic consumption increased 7.3 pct to 192,069 tonnes for the three month period, but this was not sufficient to prevent a significant rise in stocks, which climbed to 1.62 mln tonnes by the end of January, compared with 1.52 mln a year earlier.     Thai Agricultural Ministry officials have previously forecast a decline in 1986/87 raws output to around 2.3 mln tonnes from 2.48 mln in 1985/86.  \n',25

'Traders here and in Paris said the results of today\'s EC white sugar tender are hard to forecast because of plans by a group of French, West German, Dutch and Belgian operators to sell one mln tonnes of sugar into intervention.     London traders said bids for licences have been reported between 43.00 and 44.00 Ecus per 100 kilos and if any licences are granted they are likely to be towards the lower end of that range, possibly 43.30/43.50 Ecus.     Traders in Paris said they expect maximum rebates of between 43 and 43.50 Ecus.     Other than the Commission releasing no sugar for export, the likely tonnage is expected to be very small, the London traders said, while the French sources declined to estimate volume in view of the psychological impact of the planned sales into intervention in protest against EC export policies.     Last week licences for 60,500 tonnes were awarded at a maximum rebate of 43.147 Ecus.  \n',25
'Turkey is holding a buying tender for 100,000 tonnes of white sugar on March 24, traders here said.     The sugar is being sought for early arrival and will probably be met with April/May shipment sugar, they added.     Earlier today newspapers in Turkey carried an advertisement from Turkish Sugar Factories inviting offers of 100,000 tonnes of crystal sugar with a 50 pct option to increase or decrease the amount.     Over the 1983/85 period Turkey each year has exported between 240,000 and 350,000 tonnes of whites to Iran and between 62,000 and 230,000 tonnes to Iraq.     Following lower sugar crops in the past two years analysts said Turkey needs to import sugar now if it is to continue filling these export contracts, and may need to buy more.     Last month London broker C Czarnikow estimated Turkish 1986/87 production at 1.42 mln tonnes raw value against 1.4 mln in 1985/86 and an average 1.76 mln in the previous three seasons.

'New immigration rules relating to alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the U.S. Agriculture Department are meeting with objections in Congress, sources on Capitol Hill said.     USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, that would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the cultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishable commodities.     The department is considering including in its definition of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops, Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane, the New York Times reported yesterday.     Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., would like to see the definition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of which is \"a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,\" Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said.     Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying USDA hard to have their products covered by the amnesty provision, farm industry sources said.     Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation said livestock producers were \"desperate\" because they fear they will be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined that industry.     A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986 immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congress did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers who helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops and Spanish reeds was \"marginal.\"     In addition, lawmakers made it clear during consideration of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the the amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees \"a tough call,\" this source said.     USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulation except to say it was subject to change before it will be released, probably some time later this month.     While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule under consideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress is not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration question, congressional sources said.     The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill.     Congressional staff members estimate the special farm worker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to 350,000 aliens. The law would allow eligible farm workers who worked for 90 days during the year ending May 1, 1986, to apply for temporary, then permanent, resident status.  \n',25

'A leading U.S. farm-state Congressman, Jerry Huckaby, D-La., warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.     \"We\'re moving toward a direction where we could self-destruct (the U.S. sugar program),\" Rep. Huckaby, chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues, tolds in an interview.     Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.     Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.     \"I think if we\'re talking about dropping (the quota) another half mln tons, lets say, you\'re getting to the point where the program might not work,\" he said.     \"Ideally, I\'d like to freeze things right where we are,\" said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.     A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the U.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports holding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.     A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.     \"I feel like if we didn\'t expand production, we could probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),\" Huckaby said.     However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener market from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.     He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the U.S.     But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports might be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.     Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.     \"This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the program is preserved,\" Huckaby said.     Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled, either through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.     Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production.     \"I don\'t know if we will go this route, but if we do there\'s a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do that legally?\" he said.     Asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners, Huckaby said \"You build a fragile house if you do it that way.\"     Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers have expanded production, because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain.     But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would not be good policy.     Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year.     Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program.     \"The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don\'t think it will get up a head of steam,\" Huckaby said.     He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved.     Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program, Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the European Community\'s sugar policy. He said EC policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market.  \n',25
'The U.S. Agriculture Department  formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments.     In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the \"Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987\", Peter Myers, Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.     Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.     The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep. John Porter, R-Ill.     Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically-influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.     The direct payment plan outlined by the administration  targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.     For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3 cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.     The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.     Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry.     He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads.     U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a \"progressive contraction\" of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing.     Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.     USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar.     \"Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing,\" Myers said.     The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per lb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons recoverable raw sugar, under the administration\'s proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

'The United States may soon ease its 1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1987, Jerry Huckaby, a leading Congressman representing sugar growers tolds in an interview.     Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the House subcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated the easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about the impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year.     \"With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to one mln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbean countries and the Philippines,\" Huckaby said.     By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, the quota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons.     Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the September to December period \"we could get away without having to increase the quota.\"     He noted that some in the sugar industry believe an increase in the quota is justified.     Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugar refiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials to request a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refiners said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S later this year, a refiner spokesman said.     However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that it would consider the request.     Following the refiners\' request, representatives of the Florida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express opposition to any quota expansion, industry sources said.     The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from a sugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect of the current sugar program, indicates at least some grower officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the import quota, industry officials said.     Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the Reagan administration\'s interagency sugar policy group.     Asked about possible quota changes, A USDA official said \"As far as I know, changing the quota volume or the quota year is not under active consideration.\"  \n',25
'Representatives of U.S. sugar grower organizations said they expect some increase the area planted to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987 cane sugar crop also are good.     Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association, said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states, California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightly in the largest producing state of Minnesota.     Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the midwest, and this coupled with increases in California would increase U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mln acres sown last year.     USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S. sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report.     The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and grains are \"just awful,\" said Carter.     In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to plant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loan rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, said Luther Markwart, executive vice president of the American sugarbeet growers association.     \"The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,\" Markwart said.     In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a contract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said.     USDA\'s report today will not include any harvested area estimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaii and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good.     Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texas cane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start  because for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze. Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year, cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said.     In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year, but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields, said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association.     The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production threaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said.     The increases in beet plantings have especially caused concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings, particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said.     \"We haven\'t had a good weather year throughout the beet and cane areas in more than five years,\" said Godfrey, adding that the U.S. may be due for a good weather year.     Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, has threatened to offer legislation next year to curb domestic sweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987.  \n',25
'Considerable uncertainty surrounds the outcome of today\'s EC white sugar tender, traders here said, noting it remains overshadowed by European operator threats to move over 800,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.     They said that due to the dispute between the Commission and producers over the issue, it is not clear whether the Commission will authorise any exports at all or grant licences on a large tonnage.     The subsidy is seen being set above 45.00 Ecus per 100 kilos, although traders are reluctant to predict a precise level after prices fell yesterday.     Earlier, traders in Paris said they expected the Commission to award licences for around 50,000 tonnes of white sugar with a maximum export rebate of 45.75 to 46.0 Ecus.     Last week, the Commission granted licences to end August on 60,500 tonnes of whites at a maximum rebate of 44.819.  \n',25
'West German sugar production last year rose 38,000 tonnes to an estimated 3.17 mln tonnes, the Agricultural Ministry said.     It said the increase was exclusively due to higher beet sugar content, which went up to 17.93 pct from 17.3 pct in 1985.     Last year\'s beet deliveries totalled 20.22 mln tonnes, down 554,000 tonnes from the previous year.     The ministry estimates West Germany\'s sugar self-sufficiency during the current agricultural year (July/June) unchanged at 137 pct.  \n',25

'Chilean left-wing leaders were elected by the copper workers union for the first time since the left-wing government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in a 1973 coup.      Nicanor Araya, a member of the Popular Democratic Movement (MDP), was named president of the Chilean Confederation of Copperworkers (CTC), which groups 22,000 workers employed in the state-owned copper mines, union officials said.     Other members of the MDP, which includes the communist party and a faction of the socialist party, took five of the principal positions on the union\'s directorate.     The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) produces around 90 pct of the country\'s copper output of some one mln tonnes per year. Chile is the world\'s leading copper exporter and sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income.     The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union\'s directorate in elections earlier this month, with the christian democratic party holding five and the remainder being won by independents.     But the left-wing was left in control of the union after the christian democrats and independents failed to reach agreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrew from negotiations.     Union elections were called following the resignation of former president Rodolfo Seguel last October.     Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile\'s best-known union leader, said he was forced to step down after repeated court actions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating.     The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union national workers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCO following a strike in 1983.     The strike, the only copper industry stoppage staged in the past 13 years, marked the start of a wave of protests against the military rule of President Augusto Pinochet.      CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as union leader when no longer employed by the company.  \n',25
'Representatives of the International Wrought Copper Council (IWCC) and major copper producers have told the London Metal Exchange (LME) a clear statement of its forward strategy would lead to a better understanding between industry and the LME.     In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new clearing house system, industry expressed grave concern about latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which will retain the prompt date settlement basis.     Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change (the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamental change in the function of the LME and in its service to the industry, the release said.     By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from non-trade orientated markets such as Comex.     The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should take a higher priority over customer satisfaction, industry delegates said.     The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on May 29. But it had indicated that consideration would be given in due course to the cash clearing proposal, made by Amalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week.     A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance of permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry fears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of review and change, the press release said.  \n',25

'Finland\'s mining and metals group Outokumpu Oy OUTO.HE, which last week reported a 1986 loss of 83 mln markka after three successive years of profits, said it restructured its key copper processing division in an attempt to rationalize production and improve profitability.     Outokumpu\'s Managing Director Pertti Voutilainen told a news conference the reorganization involved a split of the division into a new independent division with six profit centres.     Outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and taxes of 83 mln markka after a profit of 355 mln in 1985. It had profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss, 171.2 mln, in 1982.     Outokumpu acquired two Swedish copper manufacturers in January 1986, Metallverken Ab and Wirsbo Bruks Ab, that were merged into its copper processing division.

'The Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd RGFJ.S (RGC) Mt Lyell copper mine in Tasmania will stay open for an extra five years following a new aid package from the state government, RGC said in a statement.     The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40 series stopes were mined, but will now stay open until the deeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994.     The Australian dollar\'s fall since 1985 also improved the local dollar copper price, making the company profitable and justifying the mining of deeper reserves at a copper grade of about 1.95 pct against about 1.60 pct now, the firm said.     Ore output will be cut, but the higher grades will keep contained-copper output at current levels of about 24,000 tonnes a year, it said. Capital expenditure of about 18 mln dlrs will be required over the life of the new plan, RGC said.     The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC, a major employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coast of Tasmania.     The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10 mln dlrs in aid. The new package includes an eight mln dlr advance to RGC at the long-term bond rate, power concessions and deferred royalties and payroll taxes.  \n',25

'Zambia has stopped sending its copper exports through South Africa, the official Times of Zambia said.     The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as saying the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) was diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa, but it did not say which alternative routes were being used.     ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, but Standwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), tolds recently virtually all Zambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA line to Dar es Salaam for the last three months.     During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped through Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only other available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said.     Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambian mineral ore, the line\'s record for any one month period, he added.     Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to 98 pct of Zambia\'s foreign exchange earnings and President Kenneth Kaunda tolds in a recent interview it was vital for his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding the traditional route through South Africa.     Referring to Zambia\'s preparations for a possible cut in economic links with South Africa, Kaunda tolds in an interview on March 1, \"My main concern, of course, is the mines because whatever happens we must continue to run the mines.\"     According to Mapara, TAZARA handled 1.1 mln tonnes of freight last year and is still working well below its present 1.4 mln capacity. Kaunda said that once preparations had been completed for evacuating Zambia\'s mineral exports on safe and dependable routes his government would look to increase its usage of TAZARA for other types of cargo.     The 1986 annual report of Zambia\'s state-run Metal Marketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country\'s metal exports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus 79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fell to 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985.     Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia\'s export routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed reservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira ports to handle all of Zambia\'s mineral exports, even if they could be hauled there by train.     \"The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form handle the huge exports of Zambian copper,\" one western diplomat said.     \"A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets could be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports which lack the facilities and space to handle the copper tonnage,\" he added.  \n',25
'Zambian copper production rose 3.2 pct to 113,275 tonnes in fourth quarter 1986 from 109,767 in the same 1985 period but sales fell 18.7 pct to 119,967 tonnes from 147,537, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, ZCCM, said.     A spokesman for the government-controlled mining company said the country\'s cobalt production fell 24 pct to 879 tonnes over the same period, while cobalt sales rose 92 pct to 1,734 tonnes. He did not give figures for the fourth quarter of 1985.     Lead production fell 22.9 pct to 1,670 tonnes from 2,165 and zinc production dropped 14 pct to 4,830 tonnes, he added.     ZCCM, which monopolises copper mining in Zambia and accounts for about 90 pct of the country\'s foreign exchange earnings, made a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the previous year.     The 1986 losses were after taking into account net interest payments of 426 mln kwacha, an exchange loss of 412 mln kwacha and taxes of 235 mln kwacha.  \n',25
'Minister of Mines Patrick Chitambala confirmed that Zambia had ended copper shipments through South Africa and announced that its state-run mining company had closed down its liaison office in the white-ruled republic.     He told the official Times of Zambia newspaper in an interview the government was diverting all mineral exports along rail routes to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Beira in Mozambique. Chitambala declined to say what volume of copper and other minerals were being shipped through these two ports, but he said there had not been any problem with the new arrangements.     \"So far our copper has been reaching its destinations without hindrance,\" he told the Times.     The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambia exported 100,000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and 17,000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986. Diplomatic sources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia\'s ability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam without causing massive bottlenecks at the ports.     Chitambala also said that the state-run Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) had closed its liaison office in Johannesburg, since it was now redundant.  \n',25

'Whether the European Community\'s Council of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable oils that has sparked threats of U.S. retaliation is uncertain, an EC official said.     \"It is very far from certain that it will go through,\" Sir Roy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, told reporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association.     Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and West Germany has opposed it in the past.     U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened retaliation if the tax is approved, as it would limit U.S. soybean exports to the EC. Council action is expected soon.     Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about agriculture in a new round of trade talks, it is unwilling to single out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put agricultural policy on a special fast track.     \"The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the framing of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) wording...but in tackling government subsidies to farmers on both sides of the Atlantic,\" he said.  \n',25
'The proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on the agenda and the EC Commission merely used it as a threat, the West German Feed Stuffs Industry Association (MFI) said.

'The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil.     The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year.     Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number.     However, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months.     U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.     Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today.     \"Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause March to gain on deferreds),\" one CBT crush trader said.     \"But they\'ve been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month,\" he added.     As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days.     The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.     With futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.     A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said.     Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.  \n',25

Other operators claimed they had palm oil booked for Indonesia but would not disclose tonnages.     Traders said palm oil production in Indonesia this year had been below expectations and current stocks were low. They said licences were issued at the start of the year to import crude palm oil but were subsequently revised to include RBD olein and RBD oil.     Last week there were rumours in European markets that Indonesia had issued licences to import around 135,000 tonnes of palm oil for deliveries commencing April.

'Indonesia has protested to the European Community (EC) about its plan to raise import duties on vegetable oils, which will affect the country\'s palm oil exports to the EC, Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh said.     \"Indonesia, both individually and together with other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), has protested against the EC plan to increase duties on vegetable oil imports,\" he told Indonesian reporters.     \"We very much regret the community\'s plan,\" he added.     He did not say in what form the Indonesian protest was made.     Indonesia is a major palm oil producer.     According to central bank figures, Indonesia exported 362,700 tonnes of crude palm oil to EC countries in calendar 1985 and 301,400 tonnes in the first 10 months of 1986.

'Indonesia has issued licences to traders to import palm oil to avert a possible shortage of cooking oil during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan in May, Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh tolds.     \"We have given permission for a small amount of imports to prevent a shortage during Ramadan,\" he said. He gave no figures for the amount of palm oil to be imported, but said it would come from Malaysia.     Indonesia, the world\'s second largest palm oil producer, earlier denied it had granted palm oil import licences.     Saleh was replying to a question froms after traders in London said Indonesia had issued licences to import around 135,000 tonnes of palm oil for delivery in April.     Indonesia, with 168 mln people, is the world\'s largest Moslem country. During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day and have large meals after sunset.

'Indonesia\'s palm oil output is expected to rise and exports to increase, the U.S. Embassy said in its annual report on Indonesia\'s agriculture sector.     The Indonesian government said crude palm oil (CPO) output is expected to rise to 1.56 mln tonnes in 1987 and 2.11 mln in 1988, up from a projected 1.45 mln tonnes in 1986 and 1.26 mln in 1985.     The 1986 projection of 1.45 mln tonnes is up from a provisional figure of 1.3 mln tonnes.     A U.S. Embassy assessment puts 1987 output at 1.45 mln tonnes, against 1.35 mln in 1986 and 1.208 mln in 1985.     \"More realistic estimates indicate that 1988 production will be between 1.5 and 1.6 mln tonnes,\" the report said.     The report said the abolition of the five pct CPO export tax, the devaluation of the rupiah in September 1986 and higher international palm oil prices should lead to a modest increase in exports this year.     Exports are forecast to rise to 720,000 tonnes against 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report added.  \n',25

Fluegel said his delegation had received a negative response from the Italian Agriculture Ministry, but that the attitude of the Foreign Ministry appeared \"more realistic.\"     He said the proposed tax was discriminatory against U.S. Farmers since it was basically asking them to help finance the EC\'s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on oilseeds.     Asked which EC countries might be expected to vote against the proposed tax, he said, \"Realistically, from the information we\'re getting, it looks like the English, the Germans, hopefully the Netherlands and Denmark.\" His delegation also hoped to convince Belgium to vote against the issue, he added.     Asked what form he thought U.S. Retaliatory action might take in the event of the EC tax proposal being approved, Fluegel said industrial as well as agricultural products could be involved.     U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned the EC yesterday it would face serious retaliation if it enacted the tax.

'Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil production is likely to drop sharply this year, due to lower yields, the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.     The publication expects total Malaysian output during Jan/Sept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes. For East Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000 tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75 mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986.     It said new plantings had slowed markedly in both countries, but the effects of this will not be felt until 1988-90.     Above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees reacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male inflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said.     Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected this year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This could especially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June, while in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April and July/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept.     Last year\'s cut in fertilizer use will hit this year\'s yields and bigger effects are expected within the next three years, Oil World said without elaborating.     Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this year were put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 in January 1986, Oil World said.     West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop 500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of East Malaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes.     Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about eight pct during Jan/May, but to rise from June on. Overall Indonesian output during Jan/Sept is forecast to rise three pct to 933,000 tonnes. Indonesian stocks as of April 1, however, are put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago.     Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are both running at high levels, Oil World said, and it expects the country\'s imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes during Jan/Sept. The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead of the April elections and the religious Ramadan festival throughout May, it said.     Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to 350,000 tonnes, Oil World said. The possibility that recent Indonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the country but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill Indonesia\'s export orders cannot be ruled out, it said.  \n',25

'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned the European Community yesterday it will face serious retaliation if it enacts a new tax on products such as U.S. Soybean oil.     Speaking at a news conference before a scheduled speech, Lyng said he did not think the tax, which is still in the discussion stage, would be approved.     He said the U.S. Would take serious retaliatory action because if implemented, the tax would have a considerable impact on U.S. Farmers.  \n',25
'The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) switched five mln dlrs in credit guarantees to Ecuador to provide for more sales of U.S. vegetable oil, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The credit guarantees were previously earmarked for sales of U.S. cotton, feedgrains and wheat.     The action reduces the guarantee lines previously authorized for sales of cotton from 1.5 mln dlrs to 500,000 dlrs, for feedgrains from four mln to two mln and for wheat from 45 mln dlrs to 43 mln dlrs and increases coverage for vegetable oil sales from two mln to seven mln dlrs, the department said.  \n',25
'American soybean producers and processors are hoping the proposed EC tax on vegetable oils and fats will not be imposed, but say the U.S. Is prepared to retaliate if it is introduced.     Wayne Bennett, the American Soybean Association\'s first vice president, told a news conference the U.S. Administration would not hesitate to retaliate, but both producers and processors were trying to solve the issue through negotiation.     U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said in a letter to EC officials that U.S. Retaliatory measures would cover more than agricultural products if the tax was imposed, Bennett said.     The ASA and National Soybean Processors Association (NSPA) delegations will meet top West German government officials today and tomorrow to lobby for support.     Bennett said West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal oppose the tax, but Italy and Belgium seem to have taken a hardline view on the issue.     \"Europeans in favour of the tax say it would be to their advantage economically, but that is not correct because we would hit back,\" NSPA chairman Jack Reed said.     This step would be very expensive for all and no one would emerge as a winner if the tax were introduced, he said.     Reed pointed out the U.S. Administration and the soybean industry view the EC proposal as violating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.     The proposed tax also violates the zero duty bindings agreed between the EC and U.S. In 1962, he said.     Under the zero duty bindings pact U.S. Soybeans and products can be exported to the Community duty-free.  \n',25
'U.S. Agriculture Department proposals to offer 260,000 tonnes of subsidized vegetable oil to four countries are still under consideration by an interagency trade policy group, a USDA official close to the group said.     The official, who asked not to be identified, dismissed a report circulating in markets today that the interagency trade policy review group had rejected the proposals.     Under the proposals, USDA would offer vegetable oil under the export enhancement program, EEP, to four countries, including 80,000 tonnes to Turkey and 60,000 tonnes to Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, industry sources said.     The proposals \"are still under review\" by the interagency working group, the USDA official said.  \n',25

'A meeting among government agencies today reaffirmed the strong opposition of the United States to a proposed new tax on vegetable oils and fats in the European Community, U.S. trade officials said.     Representatives of the major government agencies agreed at a trade policy review group meeting, which includes officials of the deputy secretary rank, to continue diplomatic pressure on EC member states.     \"We (all agencies) are together on this,\" said one U.S. trade official.     One source said the U.S. would continue to make clear to member states and to the EC commission that if Brussels proceeds with the vegetable oils tax \"there will be a great cost.\"     U.S. officials said no formal list of European products on which the U.S. might retaliate, has yet been drawn up.     \"I don\'t think we\'re at that point yet,\" said one trade official, adding that the EC has only begun deliberations on its farm price package.     Suzanne Early, assistant trade representative, tolds the interagency meeting was to discuss U.S. strategy on the vegetable oils issue. Asked about retaliation, she said \"sometimes its better not to be specific.\"     U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Monday warned another major transatlantic trade row will develop if the EC proceeds with the vegetable oils tax.  \n',25
'U.S. scientists said some tropical vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at risk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight to a campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) for labelling changes.     The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied by Malaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palm kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.     In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel and coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food manufacturers\' labels.     The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods.     Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and contributes to heart disease are untrue.     But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at Rutgers University, said, \"Palm oil is definitely not good for human health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid.\"     He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater the blood cholesterol level. \"It has been well established that high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart disease,\" he said.     A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, Borge Bek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil is cholesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancer properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries in humans.     Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats daily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than from palm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E.     David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view on labelling. \"What people really have to learn is to read labels,\" said Kritchevsky. \"The more a consumer knows, the more likely he will make an intelligent choice.\"     The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm, palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels.     Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, \"More saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from that point of view it\'s a health risk. High cholesterol levels in the blood are a risk factor for heart disease.\"     Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s Food and Consumer Services Division, said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have heart disease.     The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid content of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than 20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated.     David Ericksen, director of ASA\'s technical services, said U.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273 mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat.     Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S. soybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates.     U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year earlier, according to Commerce Department figures.     Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3 mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier.  \n',25

'U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter today said that if the European Community\'s Council of Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats, another major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture.     In a statement issued by the trade representative\'s office following a speech to the American Soybean Association\'s board of directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe impact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billion dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.     \"This is an unacceptable situation for us and its (vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to the European market,\" Yeutter said.     Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate EC obligations under the GATT.     He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price of soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarine made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine, and closer in price to expensive European butter.     \"I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and Portugal,\" Yeutter said.     \"It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of global trade talks),\" he said.  \n',25

'The directors of the American Farm Bureau, the nation\'s largest farm organization, voted Tuesday to urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without alterations.     \"We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,\" said Dean Kleckner, president. \"The current farm bill has been in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining the legislation.     \"Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being advanced,\" Kleckner said.     The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans competitive in the world market.     A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and the new loan rate.     The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat because of adverse weather.  \n',25
'U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz indicated the world wheat supply/demand situation has become more bullish recently because of developments in the world market and increased consumption.     Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee, Amstutz cited three factors which have improved the wheat outlook.     He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about 20 mln tonnes this year, primarily for feed use. There are also reports from Australia, Canada and Argentina that plantings have been reduced, he said. Furthermore, he cited reports of greater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union.     \"It seems reasonable to expect production and consumption to be in far better balance than a year ago,\" Amstutz said.  \n',25
'The Soviet Union\'s winter grain crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said.     Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of the EF Hutton publication \"Global Crop News,\" said in her latest report that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat, from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.     \"Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Soviet winter grain crop) is far more pessimistic,\" she said. \"But it\'s still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot will depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting.\"     Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus received on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.     The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its toll on Soviet winter crops, she said.     However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage.     The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily from Canada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia, Martell said.     She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.     Last fall\'s dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.     Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports.     However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last resort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only just recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the 1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.     Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.     In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain imports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Union bought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only 24 pct of that total.     While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87 was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised their estimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said.  \n',25
'The Soviet Union would likely be more interested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking any grain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S. wheat, an executive with a major grain export company said.     Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known make new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman, director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company.     \"Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offered a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond to,\" Hoffman tolds in an interview at an agribusiness education conference here. But if there are too many constraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take less than an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said.     Hoffman said Pillsbury\'s internal statistics put Soviet Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy offer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels, Moscow would likely buy more, he said.     \"If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, I expect they\'ll take it,\" said Vernon McMinimy, director of commodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.     McMinimy tolds spring weather and its impact on crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a subsidy offer.     Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start because of a dry autumn last year, and because of the severe winter \"they probably have had more damage due to winter weather than normal,\" McMinimy said.  \n',25
'A government official said that a decision by Brazil not to import maize because it forecast a record harvest would not affect Argentina\'s exports.     \"We have heard nothing about this, but if Brazil has decided not to import maize that is no problem for us as it is not one of our main customers,\" Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Under-Secretary Miguel Braceras said.     Private sources also said Argentina\'s exports would not be affected by Brazil\'s decision, which Agriculture Minister Iris Resende announced yesterday in Sao Paulo.

'Argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.     Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in mid-February.     But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7 pct greater than last year\'s total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures, and would be a new record.     The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.     The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province.     The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty, especially in Cordoba.     Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.     Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.     With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize, sunflower and sorghum harvesting.     Crops were considered in generally good condition, though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long-term damage.     The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.     Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.     Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest, according to official figures.     The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.     Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record 3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.     The current harvest\'s volume was again expected to be between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than last harvest\'s record 4.1 mln tonnes.     Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and, consequently, on total production volume.     The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.     Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and 1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.     Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to 22 pct lower than last harvest\'s total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.  \n',25
'Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87 soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April, trade sources said.     They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week\'s estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes forecast in mid-February.     The new forecast is still higher than last season\'s record total production.     Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1 mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season\'s new estimates.     Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires.     The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.     The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86 record of 3.34 mln hectares.     The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.     Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.     The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts.     In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.     The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.     The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares in 1985/86.     The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.     This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.     The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.     A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields.     The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year\'s record 3.14 mln hectares.     Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln tonnes.     The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.     The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.     Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to 22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.  \n',25

'The Australian Government will likely reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.) dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne.      For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5 mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the breakeven export price, it said.     Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the department said.     In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.     But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90.     The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports, the department said.  \n',25
'Australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72 mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF) said in its first preliminary crop forecast.     But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year, the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season.     Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said.     The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average, AWF said.     Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops.     \"The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses and oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a high proportion of growers\' income,\" AWF said.     AWF\'s state area forecasts in mln hectares, with 1986/87 production in mln tonnes, are as follows (crop forecasts were not given for the new wheat year)                    Area         Crop              1987/88  1986/87  1986/87  Queensland    0.82     0.82     0.95  N.S.W.        3.07     3.17     4.40  Victoria      1.53     1.63     3.25  S.Australia   1.45     1.64     2.30  W.Australia   3.53     4.46     5.60  \n',25
'The Australian Wheat Board (AWB) expects to sell about 900,000 tonnes of wheat to the Japanese Food Agency this year after renewing its annual supply agreement, AWB general manager Ron Paice said.

He noted that the Board has sold more than three mln tonnes to Japan in the past three years.  \n',25
'Australian wheat shipments rose to 1.33 mln tonnes in February from 1.01 mln in January, an Australian Wheat Board official said.     February\'s shipments were down on the 1.54 mln tonnes shipped in February 1986.     Cumulative shipments for the first five months of the October/September wheat year were 6.12 mln tonnes, as against 6.54 mln a year earlier, the official said.     The major destinations in February were: China (419,196 tonnes), Egypt (301,909), Iraq (142,055), Japan (110,261), South Korea (100,847) and the Soviet Union (100,056 tonnes).  \n',25
'Australia is risking wheat export sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said.     \"Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications,\" the board said in a submission to the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport.     \"Many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in Australia,\" it said.     The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system.     Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower-quality grades, the AWB submission said.     It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping.     Better industrial relations at grain terminals, more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing, it said.     The submission also said Australia\'s federal system impeded the AWB\'s role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat.     The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment.     \"It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored,\" it said.     For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW) might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than to Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly, southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or Geelong, in Victoria.     Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment, it said.     The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk handling authorities is not essential, although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained.     An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel at various Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houston and 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.  \n',25
'The Australian Wheat Board\'s (AWB) 1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes already sold, AWB general manager Ron Paice said.     \"We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export target for the year,\" he said in a statement.     He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the Soviet Union and Iraq.     In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes.     Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered to the AWB.     The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said.     However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said.     Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB\'s February Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes.     But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes. The official estimate is not yet available.     In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of the 16.13 mln tonne crop.     Another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000 sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB\'s receival system, according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics data.  \n',25

'Enrollment in the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s fourth conservation signup is expected to be announced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may be higher than total enrollment for the first three signups.     Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres, USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far in the 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres.     Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into the program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA\'s Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a congressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will be accepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.     As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area is expected to attract the greatest enrollment.     \"The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which we\'ll get signup in,\" a USDA conservation specialist said.     Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the acreage pulled from that area, he said.     Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production, but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small percent of the total.     A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more interest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.     Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to take land out of production for 10 years. The average rent payment accepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre.  \n',25

'U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said Canada\'s finding announced today that U.S. corn imports injure Canadian farmers is \"totally unjustified.\"     \"U.S. corn exports to Canada are so small that it is inconceivable that they injure Canadian corn farmers by any reasonable measure,\" Yeutter said in a statement.     He said if other countries follow Canada\'s lead it could result in \"a rash of protectionist actions throughout the world.\" French corn growers have recently indicated they will challenge U.S. corn gluten feed shipments to Europe.     Yeutter said the U.S. will examine the Canadian decision closely and if the U.S. believes the decision was not based on facts, \"will carefully evaluate appropriate responses.\" Yeutter did not say what steps the U.S. may take in response.  \n',25
'The Canadian government is expected to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S. government and farm group representatives said.     The deadline for a final determination is March 7.     U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case, Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the Canadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.     Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn imports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to  corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.  \n',25
'The Canadian Import Tribunal ruled today subsidized U.S. corn imports were injurious to Canadian growers and upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S. cts a bushel set earlier this year.     The ruling is the result of trade action launched in 1985 by the Ontario Corn Producers Association that contended U.S. subsidies were driving American corn prices below Canadian production costs.     A spokesman for the Department of Revenue said a study of the level of the duty will be undertaken in the next six months to determine if it should be adjusted.  \n',25
'The Canadian Wheat Board has advised the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year beginning August 1, a board spokesman said.     The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers.     \"They\'re all lower,\" he said. \"This is really getting pretty serious. We\'re talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it\'s worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop.\"     Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.     Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.     If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada\'s grain, obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.     The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet.     Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.     But federal agricultural officials have already warned farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.  \n',25

'The use of generic in-kind commodity certificates has helped ease storage problems and is a necessary part of export promotion programs, a senior executive for the world\'s largest grain company said.     Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains, Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., disputed claims that U.S. grain companies have made huge profits from certificate trading.     \"The certs program is not in any way a windfall to the trade,\" he said. Johnson said that Cargill has been dealing with a two pct spread in certificate transactions, and that this is within the normal grain marketing levels.     Johnson recognized current concern over the cost of certificates as compared to cash, but said that critics need to look more closely at the savings caused by certs, noting for example that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Roll marketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs.     Certificates are also an important part of any export promotion program, he said.     \"The more you look at ways to expand export markets, the more you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain into the market to meet demand,\" he said.     Subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman (D-Kans.) said his committee would be looking at the certificate program later this year and studying the General Accounting Office report on certificate costs.  \n',25
'Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes ahead with planned renovation.     A CBT spokesman tolds the exchange was looking at a number of options to identify the most cost effective and efficient way to proceed, including one which would involve moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange.     \"One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann\'s agenda items has been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,\" the spokesman said.     Another CBT official, executive vice president George Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor.     A number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. \"We\'ve looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such things as flip-flopping the trading rooms,\" he added.     It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets, Sladoje said.     \"If we move out of one floor entirely, then the construction period will be about a year,\" he said, adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year.     The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest.     In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits, exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains-dominated area.     This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond futures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds and T-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing the MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options.     Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT members.     One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating.     \"There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area,\" he said.     The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at a time. \"The first step, after deciding the most effective way to proceed, would be to get architectural and engineering drawings,\" he said.     He added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves. \"This is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year,\" he said.     Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which merged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month.     Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved for lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures, which now share their trading area.     The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains, livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well as some options contracts.     \"Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here because the bonds are too crowded,\" one MidAm trader said.     Another source at the MidAm said this change could take place by July or August.  \n',25

'Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets.     Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.     Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.     With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal, traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances.     An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop, means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized, traders said.     Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the more attractive deal from the government, they added.     Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton.     One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans, which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.  \n',25
'The 11,254,837 acres of highly erodable farmland submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of 10-12 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grain and soybean prices Monday, grain traders said.     Farmers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonus rental payment that was offered by the USDA, which may underpin new crop futures, they said.     New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program. But traders noted that the poor yielding acres being set-aside will result in only a modest decrease in final production figures, since farmers will concentrate on high yielding land.     Of a total 11,254,837 erodoble acres submitted, usda accepted 10,572,402 acres into the program at an average rental payment of 51.17 dlrs per acre.     Farm land signed up to date now totals 19,488,587 acres.  \n',25

'The grain output of a major Chinese grain-producing province is not increasing, because farmers lack incentives, production costs are rising, storage facilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in grain, the province\'s vice-governor said.     The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui, as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as they could growing grain, and three times as much growing cash crops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pct of farmers\' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investment had caused the area of irrigated land to fall.     Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pct of the province\'s total investment, from 26 pct in 1978.     He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain was hit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and a further 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.     He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt with trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for more investment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal use of or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the tendency to rely on grain imports.     The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate to the National People\'s Congress, attacking grain policy. He said the government had cut agricultural investment to three to four pct from 11 pct.     \"With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past few years, some people got carried away, relaxing their attention to grain and cotton production,\" he said.     On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to be self-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from the northeast, but it imports wheat.     \"Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reach the 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be considered adequate,\" Tian said.  \n',25
'China\'s summer grain harvest may be good despite a serious drought because the State Council (cabinet) has spent one billion yuan on irrigation and other anti-drought work, a Hong Kong newspaper said.     Wen Hui Bao said the drought, which has affected Shanxi, Hebei, Henan and Shandong the most, has eased with March rains in south China and March snowfall in the north and as some new irrigation projects have come into use.     \"If the drought does not worsen, there is hope for a bumper harvest,\" it quoted experts of the Ministry of Electric Power as saying. They gave no figures.     The 1986 summer grain harvest was a record 93 mln tonnes, up from 92 mln in 1985, out of a total 1986 grain harvest of 391 mln. The 1987 target is 405 mln.  \n',25
'China\'s grain imports will rise in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, but will be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials and Japanese traders tolds.     They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peaked at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982.     An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73 mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985.     Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports, which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985.     \"China is short of foreign exchange,\" the Shanghai official said. \"We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a major importer.\"     A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought, low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption.     \"At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs,\" the trader said.     The People\'s Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year\'s level.     The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln tonnes against 391 mln in 1986.     \"All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and high-yield cash crops,\" it said.     It added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought.     Since January, the press has devoted much attention to grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China\'s economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low.     Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output.     The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70,000 workers available to help farmers.     Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits.     Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province.     \"In addition, we are setting up grain production bases, raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other infrastructure,\" he said.     The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases, they lease the land to grain farmers.     The China Daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made profitable.     \"The advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption. Only this will boost enthusiasm,\" it said.  \n',25

'Wheat and rapeseed crops in east China suffered considerable damage because of frost during a spell of unusually cold weather in late March, the China Daily said.     It said average temperatures for the last 10 days of March in most of east China were three to five degrees centigrade below average. Snow fell in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and Henan, making early rice sowing difficult.     Heavy snow blanketted central and south Jilin and north Liaoning, leaving farmland too muddy for spring ploughing and sowing, the paper said.     The paper said rainfall during the last 10 days of March in areas south of the Yangtze had been much higher than normal.     Heavy rain fell last Sunday in parts of Guangdong, ending a particularly arid dry season and marking the start of the flood season, it said. It gave no further details.     The New China News Agency said rain and snow in Henan had improved the prospects for wheat, sown on 4.8 mln hectares, and caused a drop in grain prices at rural fairs since late February.

'Kansas Republican Congressman Pat Roberts urged the Reagan administration to offer export enhancement program, eep, subsidies to the Soviet Union.     Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee, Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, and should also include the Soviet Union.     Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue of an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan administration recently because Secretary of State George Shultz was out of the country.     \"That very well may be the case,\" said Tom Kay, U.S. Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Service administrator. However, Kay tolds later that his reply to Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge.     Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of the USDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow.     \"I\'d be delighted to deliver the message,\" Kay replied.     Earlier, Kay had repeated Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng\'s statement last week that \"the door is not yet closed on an eep to the Soviet Union.\"  \n',25
'Congress, eager to find budget savings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDA and the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over how much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers.     The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked not to be identified said.     USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying it did not take into account storage, handling and transport savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to re-examine the costs, sources said.     The issue is an important one, because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending.     Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.     Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp, CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.     USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage.     It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress\' investigative arm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs, Reagan administration sources said.     The GAO is expected to point out that use of payment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold.     The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of PIK certificates.     The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash.     Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another 6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and August 1987, according to USDA.     Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate.     Eliminating this practice, called \"PIK and roll,\" would save the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.     The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other savings alternatives.     The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one administration official said.     However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.     The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year.     USDA\'s Economic Research Service, for example, has found that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel.     Between September and November, however, certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS study, obtained bys.  \n',25
'CPC International Inc officials said the sale of the company\'s European corn wet milling business will remove about 700 mln dlrs of debt and liabilities from CPC\'s balance sheet.     They told analysts the deal, expected to close in September, and cash flow from other operations will reduce total debt by about one-third this year. At the end of 1986, CPC\'s debt totaled about 1.5 billion dlrs.     The officials also said the company has no current plans to sell its U.S. or North American corn wet milling businesses.     CPC\'s 1987 capital spending is budgeted at about 250 mln dlrs, down from about 361 mln dlrs last year, the officials told analysts.  \n',25
'China\'s top leader Deng Xiaoping said China must not import more than 10 mln tonnes of grain, Ming Pao newspaper of Hong Kong said.     Customs figures show that China imported 7.73 mln tonnes of grain in 1986, up from 5.97 mln in 1985 but down from a record 16.15 mln in 1982.     The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output is one of several key issues that will influence the whole development of the economy. It did not give the context of his remarks. The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln, up from 391 mln in 1986.     The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation has reached the point where \"pigs are not fed, there is not enough grain and increases in output have slowed.\"     \"We should in our overall economic planning put agriculture in its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes by the year 2000,\" he said. \"We must avoid the situation in recent years of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain.\"     The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council has decided to raise the price of five grains, including corn and rice, unchanged since 1978, but it gave no details.  \n',25
'Drought has resulted in a reduction in China\'s estimated wheat crop this year to 87.0 mln tonnes, 2.0 mln below last year\'s harvest, the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s officer in Peking said in a field report.     The report, dated March 25, said imports in the 1987/88 season are projected at 8.0 mln tonnes, 1.0 mln tonnes above the the current season\'s estimate.     Imports from the United States are estimated at 1.5 mln tonnes compared to only 150,000 tonnes estimated for the 1986/87 year, it said.     After travelling to major wheat producing areas and obtaining more information on the planted area, the total planted area was estimated down 290,000 hectares due to the dry fall, it said.     The report said to compensate for the below normal precipitation irrigation has increased as has the use of fertilizer.     While there are pockets where irrigation is not possible, most of the wheat crop has access to some water and therefore has emerged from dormancy and is doing well, the report said.     It said scattered rain in many parts of China in the past 10 days has improved the situation but information on hail damage in Anhui is incomplete.  \n',25

Some 840,000 hectares of farmland have been planted with cash crops including sugar cane, peanuts and soybeans, 67,000 ha more than in 1986.     The provincial government has increased investment in grain and taken effective measures to combat natural disasters this year, the agency said, but gave no further details.  \n',25
'A large Dutch animal feed compounder will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test case on the way the EC grain co-responsibility levy is applied, a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association, Het Comite, tolds.     Het Comite has been co-ordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and, since December, has lodged more than 80 individual cases with the Business Appeal Court in The Hague.     The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country.     Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain commodity board.     The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration Court in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10.     The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the 80 lodged \"because the bill (the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved grain from a wide variety of origins.\" The name of the company is not being made public.     The Administration Court is not expected to make a final ruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal Court in Luxembourg, and \"as a result it could easily be another nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved.\"     Meanwhile, the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is collected, the spokesman said.     Het Comite, as a member of FEFAC, the association of European animal feed manufacturers, is also a party to actions protesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court.  \n',25
'Winter wheat crops in the western Soviet Union, Poland and eastern Czechoslovakia through northern Romania may suffer some winterkill over the next two nights, private forecaster Accu-Weather Inc said.     Western USSR winter wheat areas have had only light and spotty snow and winterkill is possible tonight and tomorrow night as temperatures drop to minus 10 to 0 degrees F.     Snow cover is scant in Poland, with only about 50 pct of the winter wheat areas reporting one to two inches of snow as of this morning.     The remaining 50 pct of winter wheat crops do not have snow cover, making winterkill possible on each of the next two nights. Lowest temperatures will be minus 10 to 0 degrees F.     Winter wheat areas from eastern Czechoslovakia through northern Romania had light snow flurries yesterday and last night, but amounts were an inch or less. With temperatures expected to fall to near 0 degrees F over the next two nights, some light winterkill is possible, Accu-Weather added.  \n',25
'The European Community authorised the export of 25,000 tonnes of barley yesterday, bringing the cumulative total at weekly tenders since the series started last June to 3.33 mln tonnes, close to the 3.37 mln under licence in the same year ago period, traders said.     All bids for wheat were rejected. However, the total to date of 5.06 mln tonnes is still substantially more than the 3.03 mln under licence a year ago. The 80,000 tonnes of French maize granted for export moved the total to 135,000 tonnes since the tender opened in February this year. There were no facilities for maize in the previous weekly grain export series.  \n',25
'Emergency action to distribute European Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has proved so successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a permanent scheme, a Commission spokesman said.     Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores between January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved the scheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures.     The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnes of sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, has been distributed to the needy through charities.     The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to help poor people affected by this year\'s unusually cold winter and will end on March 31.     But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether to propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system.     The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units (72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr) ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers.     However, commission sources said the real cost was small if account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until its quality and value deteriorates.     On the other hand, the impact of the temporary scheme on EC food surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks at January 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.  \n',25
'The European Community\'s, EC, cereal management committee granted export licences for 5,000 tonnes of quality soft bread-making wheat at a maximum export rebate of 134.75 European currency units, Ecus, per tonne, traders said.     The committee also granted export certificates of 35,000 tonnes of barley at 137.35 Ecus per tonne, but rejected all bids for the export of soft feed wheat, they said.     Certificates were also granted for the export of 15,000 tonnes of maize at a maximum rebate of 132.90 Ecus per tonne, the traders said.  \n',25
'The EC Commission will decide shortly precisely how to arrange the import of third country maize and sorghum into the EC in fulfilment of its agreement with the United States, Commission sources said.     Under the accord, reached following U.S. complaints about the impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish EC membership, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990.     All this produce will be imported into Spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other EC countries.     The sources said it was possible that the Spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.     They added that the choice for future years appears to lie between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily special levy applicable to Spanish imports.     There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize and sorghum from Spain to other EC countries, although such a tax could be imposed later, the sources added.  \n',25
'The agreement between the U.S. And the European Community (EC) on special imports of maize and sorghum provides an equal chance for all non-EC countries to supply the Spanish market, an EC Commission spokeswoman said.     She denied that any unpublished clause of the agreement guaranteed the bulk of the maize export business would go to the U.S., As one EC official tolds yesterday.     Under the agreement, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year into Spain at specially reduced levy rates for the next four years.     The Commission has yet to decide whether the maize will come in through direct purchases by the Spanish intervention board or by a tender system.  \n',25
'The European Community, EC, sold 75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85 and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains.     EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season, it said.     The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.     The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production, and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.     It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.  \n',25
'European Community (EC) member states have generally given a cool initial reaction to proposals by the European Commission for cereal price changes and related measures in the coming season, EC diplomats said.     They said that in meetings of the EC Special Committee on Agriculture representatives of most member states had said the changes, taken together, would have too harsh an impact on farmers\' incomes.     Only Britain and the Netherlands had shown willingness to accept the commission\'s overall package, they said.     As well as cuts of over two pct in common prices for most cereals, the commission proposes a limitation of intervention to the February to March period and reduced monthly increments in intervention prices.     EC Farm Ministers will have a first discussion of the proposals at a meeting beginning next Monday.  \n',25
'The U.S. Senate Finance Committee approved nonbinding resolutions urging the Reagan administration oppose Canada\'s ruling on U.S corn imports and a proposed new European Community tax on vegetable oils.     The resolutions, approved by voice vote, now will be sent to the Senate floor were they are expected to be approved.     The EC oils measure, offered by Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., urges the administration to take strong retaliatory measures if the tax is approved by the EC Council of Ministers.     Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., offered the corn amendment which urges the administration to file a complaint with the GATT if the U.S. believes the corn decision by Canada was unjustified. Canada recently imposed a permanent duty of 85 cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports.  \n',25
'The EC Commission decided to open a special daily export rebate today for maize exports to Morocco, Israel, Canary Islands and zone 5c (Sub-Saharan Africa), trade sources said here.     The rebate was set at 153 European currency units per tonne for March and 133 for April through July.  \n',25

'The European Commission has not taken a decision on applications from the British government for the release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the British market in May and June, Commission sources said.     They said last week\'s cereals management committee agreed to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.     However, it decided to leave consideration of the release of further wheat until later.     The British government had applied for the release of a further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British intervention stores to prevent market prices rising.     However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to review the market situation nearer the time before giving its approval.     The Commission was given new powers last year to control the release of intervention cereals onto the market, the sources noted.     Following last week\'s committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes, depending on the state of the market.     This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission had actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during the three months of April, May and June at last week\'s meeting.  \n',25
'The European Community Commission has decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne imposed on exports of Spanish maize, Commission sources said.     They said the tax, which applies to Spanish sales to EC and non-EC countries alike, would no longer be required on exports from Spanish ports south of Valencia.     The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority\'s cereals management committee today.     The tax had been introduced last September at the same time as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports of maize to Spain from other EC member countries.     The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from being reexported back to them.     The sources added that Spain had received no answer from the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the sale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize.     The request will be considered at the committee\'s next meeting, the commission sources said.     Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes of maize this year, while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-EC producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.  \n',25
'The European Commission is to consider proposed new higher minimum standards for sales of durum wheat into intervention stores, European Community sources said.     They said a document drawn up by Commission officials proposes a reduction in the maximum humidity level to 13 pct from 14, an increase in the minimum weight to 78 kilos per hectolitre from 76, a tightening of other technical standards and introduction of some new ones.     Current public stocks of durum wheat in the EC are 1.15 mln tonnes, of which almost 1.12 mln are in Italy.  \n',25
'Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino weather pattern, Accu-Weather Inc, a commercial weather forecasting service, said.     Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts, offical reports, government officials and meteorologists said.     Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.     Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.     Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure for over 20 years, the paper said.     The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers, it added.     This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causing shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.     Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China, media reports said. The People\'s Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February.     The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.     Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the country\'s tea crop, Ministry of Plantation Industries officials tolds     In Australia, concern is growing about below-average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australia\'s wheat belt, local Meteorological Bureau officials said.     For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.     Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino, they said.     Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia-Pacific region\'s disrupted weather patterns to any single cause, El Nino\'s role is being closely studied, they said.     Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino \'event\' was unique.     The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 1982/83, it said.     El Nino, Spanish for \"Christ Child\" because it appears around Christmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing clouds and rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds, meteorologists said.     The winds, strengthened by El Nino\'s \"pump\" effect, raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.     When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.     One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.     The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weather said.     China, where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for the May-September rains, it said.     The May-September rains normally provide the drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.     In Australia, areas of Queensland\'s coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end.     In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year. The year\'s secondary rains usually occur between April and June, although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual.  \n',25
'\"If we go on using up farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in 20 years to grow grain on.\"     Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes.     China has to feed one quarter of the world\'s population, but only one seventh of its land is arable.     Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in 1986.     But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.     Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during the two years.     \"We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the industrialisation began,\" official Xu said. \"Since then, nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up.\"     \"Last year we lost land to a new railway line,\" Xu said. But land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses, she added.     The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year.     \"The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully, wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,\" said an article in the official press explaining the new measures.     \"It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,\" it said. \"China has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient.\"     An official of the Shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must be approved by the city government.    The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure China\'s people get enough grain to eat. The prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making it more profitable for them to grow other crops.     To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to China\'s 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.     Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.     Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too much to the demands of \"selfish city people\" and could raise city grain prices without any problem.     But the government has ruled out a price rise. \"Raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability,\" said a China Daily editorial this month.     The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term. \"We must be very careful. We have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises,\" he said. \"The problem is how to do it.\"     The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents.     In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.     The official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.     Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops, but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.     \"As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the future,\" the China Daily said in an editorial last month.     Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it. For most of the period of Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative.     \"New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long-term investment,\" the newspaper said.  \n',25
'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, should be used as a \"tactical tool\" and not as a general policy.

He did not comment directly on the Soviet question, replying that any decision would be made at the highest levels of the Reagan administration, and \"I don\'t want to preempt that.\"     Yeutter told the National Grain and Feed Association EEP should continue to be used as a tactical tool against the European Community but not as a general policy.

'The size of French 1986/87 carryover barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.     He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the end of February from the previous month while export forecasts were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.     Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are opened for French barley a large amount could be put into intervention.     A small amount of French barley has already been put into intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.     The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000 tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in 1985/86.     The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission\'s decision to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said.  \n',25
'Upcoming changes being considered in the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s transportation and loan programs were outlined by a USDA official today.     Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association, Tom VonGarlem, assistant deputy administrator for USDA\'s state and county operations, said the following changes are under consideration by USDA.     Termination of USDA\'s Transportation Assistance Program for wheat, barley and sorghum would be proposed this week.     Changes in USDA\'s reserve rotation program are also under consideration, VonGarlem said. While the department has not made any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said.     Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next year\'s crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates under consideration.     VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop program signup, saying he sees no reason to do so at this time.

'French maize producers will ask the EC Commission to grant permanent maize export rebates following the recent EC/U.S. Accord guaranteeing the U.S. An annual export quota of two mln tonnes of maize for Spain over four years, the French maize producers association, AGPM, said.     The Commission has already decided to accord rebates for the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize, of which rebates for around 100,000 tonnes have been granted.     The request will be made when export certificates have been granted for all the 500,000 tonnes, the AGPM said.     The association said that the request would cover exports to all destinations, adding that the Soviet Union, which has important maize needs, is currently excluded from the list of destination countries for the 500,000 tonnes of French maize.     The U.S. Agriculture Department has forecast Soviet maize imports for the 1986/87 campaign at 4.90 mln tonnes against 10.40 mln in 1985/86.  \n',25
'French Agricultural Minister Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject proposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugar and oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt these markets.     The EC Commission\'s proposals to shorten the intervention period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in lower real prices for producers, he told farmers here.     \"I give you my word that France, while it will not reject technical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply reply in the negative to these bad reforms,\" Guillaume told the annual conference of the country\'s major farm union, FNSEA  (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).     Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.     Relations between the government and farmers have become strained in France in recent months.     There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and further cutbacks in Community milk output.     But Guillaume\'s warning that he would reject reorganisation of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the FNSEA\'s farmers.     His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary Compensatory Amounts, MCA\'s, however, are unlikely to avoid further protests by producers.     Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad against the EC Commission\'s proposals to overhaul the farm sector.     \"The Minister\'s proposals back up our determination to organise union action in the coming weeks,\" he told reporters, adding that this could also act in Guillaume\'s favour on a ministerial level.     Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being appointed farm minister last spring.     Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.     There have been certain advances on cutting production costs, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, but there are still areas where more could be done such as on farmers\' indebtedness, he said.     Guillaume told the conference the government will make available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.     The government has already announced financial aid for the milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package announced today was new aid, Lacombe said.  \n',25
'French cereal exports through the port of Rouen fell 6.4 pct to 725,023 tonnes during the period February 1 to 25, from 774,704 for the period February 1 to 26 last year, trade sources said.

The country also bought around 30,000 tonnes of EC soft wheat 12 days ago at 80 to 81 dlrs a tonne, fob, they said.  \n',25
'French soft wheat exports to other European Community countries fell 18 pct to 4.13 mln tonnes in the first seven months of the 1986/87 season to January compared with 5.04 mln in the same 1985/86 period, the French Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) said.     According to latest ONIC statistics, the main buyers were Italy with 1.89 mln against 1.63 mln in the same 1985/86 period, West Germany 480,450 tonnes against 717,689, the Netherlands 462,048 (532,299) and Belgium 417,887 tonnes (919,337).     British and Greek imports of French soft wheat during this period were below year-ago levels. Between July 1 last year and January 31, Britain bought 274,665 tonnes against 642,800 tonnes, ONIC figures showed.     But Spanish purchases were up sharply at 258,507 tonnes against 2,751 tonnes in the same 1985/86 period and Portugal bought 37,599 tonnes compared with zero.     ONIC said the drop in French exports to other Community countries was due to British competition.  \n',25
'Poland\'s winter wheat is likely to survive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not be known until late April, the Polish meteorology institute said.     Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can survive ground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees C, Spokesman Teresa Tomaszewska tolds.     Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainly melted in February, air temperatures down to minus 30 C should not be harmful, she said, but added that wheat can still be damaged by cold spells in March and April, when young shoots may be exposed to night frosts.  \n',25
'A study on grain certificates due out shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays, administration and industry sources said.     Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official tolds.     GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee.     The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.     The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on the program\'s impact on the USDA loan program.     If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up. However, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.     GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.     But a negative report on certificates \"will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program,\" an agricultural consultant said.     The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program, while USDA remains firmly committed to it.  \n',25
'Over 240 mln bushels of government grain have been allocated in redemptions for commodity certificates since the program began April 30, according to the Commodity Credit Corporation.

'The U.S. grain planting intentions and stocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, a grain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said.     The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks are \"the first report we\'ve had for a long time that shows any optimism for anybody,\" said John \"Bud\" Frazier, grain analyst and executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc.     \"I\'m really excited about it,\" Frazier said.     The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend to plant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted last year, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln.     The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels of soybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushels of wheat, all below trade guesses.     Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analyst with AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Trade panel to discuss the reports.     Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly for the market, and soybean prices would jump three to five cents a bushel \"if the bell rang right now.\"     \"We\'re getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn and soybeans) than we thought we had,\" he said, noting that hog and poultry production is up.     \"We\'re seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,\" said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and 15 pct in the preceding quarter.     However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceed consumption.     She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came in southeastern states, where yields are usually low.     \"We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields this year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow\'s opening,\" she said.     Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and the crop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down from last year\'s 8.25 billion bushels.     \"We\'ll need very good disappearance next year to reduce stocks,\" she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last year at 6.7 billion bushels.     Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long term, \"But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down to where we could start rebuilding prices.\"     Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more soybeans.     The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage talk of revising the 1985 farm bill.     \"There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law we\'re working under today, and this report should reinforce that,\" Frazier said.     \"We are seeing the program beginning to work,\" said Meyer.  \n',25

'Fresh, heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade sources said.     They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production forecasts were made for all these crops.     The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province.     The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.     The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.     In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay.     In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.     The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.     Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.     The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.     Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces.     The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.     The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.     The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weather permitting.     Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln tonnes, against last week\'s 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4 to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private producers put 1985/86 production.     The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season\'s production.     The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers\' targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.     The production forecast was reduced to between three and 3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4 to 26.8 pct down on last season\'s 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.     The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.     The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to 7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.     These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season\'s record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources, and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.     The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop, sources said.     Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further.     The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season.     Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires.  \n',25
'With less than a week remaining to enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, Agriculture Department officials said that final signup will probably exceed last year\'s level of 85 pct.     Enrollment in USDA\'s basic acreage reduction program will likely total close to 90 pct, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, ASCS, officials said, with 50 to 70 pct of the enrolling farmers also expected to sign up for the paid land diversion program.     The signup period of the 1987 feedgrains program officially ends at the close of the business day on March 30.     USDA will release its official signup report around April 15, an official said.     USDA personnel in the corn belt states of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana have been reporting heavy signup activity, an ASCS official tolds.     A surge of acitivity is expected during this final week of signup, the official said.     \"A lot of farmers have been dragging their feet because they were anticipating some changes in the program, but that doesn\'t look very likely now,\" he said.     To enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, farmers have to set aside 20 pct of the program acreage base, and have the option to idle an additional 15 pct under a paid land diversion program.  \n',25

The department said it may buy the wheat, valued at 8.5 mln dlrs, the corn, valued at 1.5 mln, and the tallow, valued at 2.0 mln dlrs, between March 24 and August 31, 1987, and ship it from U.S. ports and/or Canadian transshipment points by this September 30.

'The 1988 agriculture budget will have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.     Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending, said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.     Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.     Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988 budget, Glickman added.     Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA\'s  proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.     \"The administration\'s target price proposals are dead in the water,\" he said.     To cut the budget, Glickman said, \"everthing is on the table,\" except those moves that would reduce farmers\' income.     Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee will study in order to cut farm spending.     Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and 1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.     Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or \"pik\') certificates will also be another option his committee will study, Glickman said.     While not committing himself for or against such action, he said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which indicate certificates cost more than cash payments.     Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and tightening up of the person definition for annual payment limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.     He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would not be in favor of such a change.     Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program\'s, EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being used up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand this program while making cuts in other areas.     Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.     \"I don\'t see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping block,\" Glickman said.  \n',25
'The shareholders of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote Wednesday on its possible dissolution.     The directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume and increasing costs.     Sources close to the organization tolds the pullout of Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock, led to the call for dissolution.     The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership.     Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960.     But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark.     With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president of the co-op.     Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became affiliated with Cargill, Inc.     Illinois Co-op\'s other members include such regional cooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist, of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries in Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and Harvest States in Minneapolis.     Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.     Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.     Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.     Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the National Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.     \"The period we\'ve gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch,\" he said. \"There\'s been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co-ops.\"     One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export, rather than exporting it themselves, losing potential profits.     But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers Export Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served \"to make folks gun-shy,\" Hanes said.     Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in U.S. agricultural economics.     A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm \"was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of doing business.\"     \"We\'re sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,\" he said. \"But there are lot of people out there to do business with. There are plenty of capable firms.\"     Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures through a Chicago-based cooperative.     \"In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals, there would be economic savings,\" he said but added, \"The times change and with changing times, come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around.\"     Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability. \"I would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy organization.\"     In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members\' equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for the most recent year has not been filed.     Under the cooperative system, income from operations is returned as \"patronage refunds\" to the members.     Income and refunds in the past five years have been declining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0 mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28, 1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.     \"You\'re dealing with substantially lower volume,\" Mulligan said. \"Lower volume translates into higher costs.\"     According to the company\'s 1986 annual report, Growmark owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.     Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution. Equity is distributed according to each member\'s trading volume and, as a result, changes from year to year.     However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark pulled out.  \n',25
'Indonesia\"s agriculture sector will grow by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.     Production of Indonesia\"s staple food, rice, is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on Indonesia\"s agricultural performance.     The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987.     The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks.     \"Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain,\" the report says.     \"The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels.\"     Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines.     The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as \"wereng\" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields.     The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types.     The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices.     Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says.     But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.     The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September\"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand.     The report said that Indonesia\"s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984.     The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump.  \n',25
'Indonesia\'s wheat imports are expected to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln in 1986, the U.S. Embassy\'s annual agriculture report said.

It forecast end-1987 stocks at around 290,000 tonnes.     The main suppliers in 1986 were Australia (44 pct), the U.S. (29 pct), Canada (12 pct), Argentina (8 pct) and Saudi Arabia (5 pct).  \n',25

No injuries were reported at the Lone Rock Coop facility.     The dispatcher said the elevator was filled with corn, and a nearby drying building holding soybeans was on fire.

'The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has transferred 21.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees previously earmarked for sales of U.S. corn and 5.0 mln dlrs for sales of oilseeds to increase available coverage on sales of U.S. poultry meat to Iraq, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The department said the action was taken at the request of Iraq\'s State Trade Organization for Grains and Foodstuffs.     The guarantee line for sales of corn has been reduced from 78.0 mln dlrs to 57.0 mln and the line for oilseeds from 5.0 mln dlrs to zero.

'Ivory Coast maize output has risen steadily during the last two decades and the country aims to produce two mln tonnes annually \"very rapidly,\" the official daily Fraternite Matin reported.     It said the country reached self-sufficiency in maize three years ago and harvested a record 530,000 tonnes in 1985 compared with only 200,000 tonnes 20 years earlier.     The daily did not detail 1986 output but said further production increases are anticipated in the years ahead as part of a policy of boosting domestic output to cut grain imports.  \n',25
'The International Wheat Council (IWC) lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, compared with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.     In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in 1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments. The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.     The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.     The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.     At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.     Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise.     After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in 1987, the IWC said.     Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC said.     It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at end&#127;of different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.     After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln tonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.  \n',25
'Efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its latest monthly report.     Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.     In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina, which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income, there may be problems in reducing production.     A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited. Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.     The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries.     They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.     Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long period.     This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production, the report said.     The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture, possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production.     The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.     These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.     For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which most export transactions are denominated, the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure, the report says.     The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to increased production in China and India.     The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower acreages.     In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S. Acreages are attributed to official incentives.  \n',25
'The government daily Izvestia said a considerable amount of Soviet winter crops need to be reseeded and the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes will not be easy to fulfil.     Without giving figures, the newspaper said: \"A considerable part of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that creates extra effort in the fields in spring.\"     The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill.     A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in 10 years.     \"The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes of grain is not simple,\" Izvestia said.

'Japanese feed and starch makers actively bought U.S. Corn last week, C and F basis, for July/September shipment in view of bullish freight rates following active inquiries by the Soviet Union, trade sources said.     Some said the makers were seen buying some 30 pct of their requirements, estimated at about three mln tonnes for the three-month shipment period.     \"Belief is growing that freight rates will not decline sharply from current high levels even in the usually sluggish summer season because the Soviet Union\'s chartering is seen continuing five to seven months from April,\" one source said.     The sources said Japanese trading houses were seen covering a total of 500,000 tonnes of Chinese corn for shipment in May to October. But they are believed to have not yet sold most of the corn to end-users in anticipation of further corn price rises in the world market.     Supply from Argentina and South Africa for July/September is still uncertain. But the sources forecast supplies from Argentina may fall to 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes from an anticipated 800,000 in calendar 1987 and from South Africa to 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes from an estimated one mln in light of tighter export availability.  \n',25
'A Japanese real estate company said it will launch a campaign to sell land in U.S. Farming areas to rich Japanese.     Higashi Nippon House said it would offer around 2,200 acres of land in Illinois, California, Florida and Indiana from early April to gauge response. It set up International Farm Corp of America in Chicago last September to oversee the operation.     American farmers would continue as working tenants and part of the profits from harvests of rice, corn, soybean and oranges would go to the Japanese investors as rental.     Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials tolds sales were limited to farmers to keep land in agricultural use.     \"Two years ago, I began to seek my own farmland in Japan,\" said Isao Nakamura, president of Higashi Nippon. \"However, sale of Japanese farmland is strictly controlled by the government, so I began to look for the land in the U.S to make my dream to own farm land come true.\"     Nakamura said hundreds of companies exist in the U.S. To sell farmland to investors as more and more farmers face difficulties due to the recession in U.S. Agriculture.  \n',25
'Japan should increase foreign access to its farm products market, while encouraging further development of domestic agriculture, a government report said.     The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31 said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.     Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an easing in Japan\'s tough position on agricultural imports which stressed the need for strict controls on some products to maintain self-sufficiency in food.     Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs, down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.     The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances.     The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly responsible for higher domestic prices, it said.     The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper said.     This could make it difficult to improve the industry\'s structure, the paper said.     To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices to more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it self-supporting, it said.  \n',25

'The Kansas City Board of Trade, KCBT, has asked federal futures regulators to modify a proposal to raise the Chicago Board of Trade\'s, CBT, speculative position limits on wheat futures contracts, saying the plan would put the the Kansas exchange \"at a serious competitive disadvantage.\"     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last month proposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200 contracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900 contracts for any single month from 600 contracts.     At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT\'s wheat speculative position limits unchanged.     \"Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat would significantly impair the KCBT\'s ability to compete with the CBT for speculative interest,\" Michael Braude, president of the Kansas exchange, said in a letter to CFTC.     A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open interest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing to raise CBT\'s limits.     KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging efficiency, constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of the exchange\'s wheat options contract and impair its ability to attract large speculators.     The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend its proposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact same bushel amount as specified for CBT wheat.     CFTC will consider public comments on the proposal until June 3.  \n',25

'The Agriculture Department\'s widening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect county posted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states, a USDA official said.     All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will counties which use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of Commodity Operations Division for the USDA.     USDA last night notified the grain industry that effective immediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior corn would be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts, depending on what the differential is.     USDA\'s action was taken to lower excessively high posted county prices for corn caused by high gulf prices.     \"We\'ve been following this Louisiana gulf situation for a month, and we don\'t think it\'s going to get back in line in any nearby time,\" Burgess said.     Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulf differentials when and if Gulf prices recede. \"If we\'re off the mark now because we\'re too high, wouldn\'t we be as much off the mark if we\'re too low?\" he said.     While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall, Burgess said no other changes in USDA\'s price system are being planned right now.     \"We don\'t tinker. We don\'t make changes lightly, and we don\'t make changes often,\" he said.  \n',25
'Rising demand for U.S. rice may gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite sluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, the department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the 1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mln hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on July 31.     Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is expected to decline this year, the report said.     USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain relative to long grain have increased, the loan differential has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields relative to those of other classes have leveled off.     With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the marketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a faster rate, USDA said.     \"Development of new products and increased promotion have helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of consumers,\" USDA said.     USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because of large production and stocks but a weaker market should affect competing exporters more than the U.S.     \"The United States has already recovered a substantial share of the European Community market and made inroads into markets in the Middle East and Africa,\" the report said.     World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels in 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes, increased domestic production and low import prices have allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse grains.     China, India and South Korea have increased output, while the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the mid-1970s, the report said.  \n',25
'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he is \"very disappointed\" by a Canadian government finding that U.S. corn has injured Ontario Corn growers.     \"This action is not helpful in the context of the ongoing U.S.-Canada free trade talks or in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations,\" Lyng said in a statement.     The Canadian government today said Ottawa would continue to apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports.     Lyng said the U.S. made a case that U.S. corn imports are not the cause of any problem of Canadian corn producers, adding that U.S. corn exports to Canada are declining.     \"Apparently they (Canada) have ignored the fact that Canadian corn and other coarse grain production is rising faster than consumption,\" Lyng said.  \n',25

Hofer described Lyng as \"sympathetic but noncommittal,\" and said he thought he detected \"a sense of frustration\" on Lyng\'s part at not being able to respond more positively to the group\'s urging.     A grain industry representative said some participants were \"puzzled\" by USDA\'s apparent reluctance to bring before the cabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.     \"There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to the idea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been,\" this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referring to an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.     This official said there was not a significant amount of pressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEP offer to Moscow.     Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) had written two letters to Lyng urging such an offer, this official said Lyng had received virtually no phone calls from lawmakers on the subject.

It would depend on what price they offered.\"     Lyng added that he did not think the price of U.S. wheat was far off the world price.

Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to 31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mm in Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in Chaco.     Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the rains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflower crops may have suffered.     Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by the bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rains would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow farm machinery to operate.     The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern Buenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas there since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.     Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares, Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after flying over the flooded area.     Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000 hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that 200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are low-lying and flood easily.     Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of the damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.     The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between 15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct a week ago.     Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were revised downward in light of the bad weather.     Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down 34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year\'s record harvest of 4.1 mln tonnes.     Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15 pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week ago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2 mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a week ago.     Last year\'s maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes, according to official figures.     Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mln tonnes a week ago. Last year\'s soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures.     Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching between four and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to four pct a week ago.     Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest.  \n',25
'The Commodity Credit Corporation has approved an additional 45.0 mln dlrs under its interemdiate export credit guarantee program, GSM-103, for sales of U.S. wheat to Morocco, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The action increases Morocco\'s cumulative fiscal year 1987 program for wheat under GSM-103 to 75.0 mln dlrs.     The credit terms extended for exports under the program must be in excess of three years but no more than seven years to eligible for credit coverage. All sales under this line must be registered and exported by September 30, 1987.     The department also said the guarantee line for sales of U.S. wheat under the Export Credit Guarantee Program, GSM-102, has been decreased 45.0 mln dlrs to 60.0 mln.  \n',25
'Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official tolds.     \"How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement if the United States does not want to offer us grain at competitive prices?\" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.     \"We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive prices,\" he said in an interview.     Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at prevailing market prices.     \"We are being accused of not implementing this agreement. We do not consider we are at fault,\" Melnikov said.     Article I in the agreement states that \"purchases/sales of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms.\"     \"The United States should supply to the Soviet Union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the United States ready to supply this?\" he said.     The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.     Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.     \"If the United States is interested in selling its wheat, then they must offer competitive prices, and it\'s up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered,\" he said.     Last year\'s U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said. He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer, U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.  \n',25
'More generic grain certificates should be released onto the market in order for the U.S. certificate program to have its full effect on commodities, according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc.     The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third certificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989,  Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates.     Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughly a 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said.     The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a \"zero certificate case,\" where no certificate program was assumed, and an alternative case labeled \"adequate certificate case\" in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings.     The study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by 11.2 pct.     Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grain usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct.     For the five-year period examined, government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or 7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.     The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs.     The study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined.     The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash.  \n',25

'U.S. exporters will have the opportunity to sell an additional 300,000 tonnes of U.S. durum wheat to Algeria under the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The department said the sales will be subsidized with commodities from the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, inventory and the subsidy will enable U.S. exports to compete at commercial prices in the Algerian market.     Algeria has already purchased 300,000 tonnes of U.S. durum wheat under a previous export enhancement initiative announced November 10, 1986, it said.

'A greater than anticipated need, competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking Soviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officials said.     As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely.     First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last year\'s Soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln announced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain.     A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect Soviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said.     Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its Argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln tonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also cut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.     Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this year\'s corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln tonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR.     \"Significant downside potential\" still exists for the Argentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow.     \"If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can provide during the April to June period,\" he said.     Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked Soviet buying.     U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Soviet sources said.     \"This price difference makes American corn competitive,\" Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union, tolds.     Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause those prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. corn futures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said.     Finally, some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains agreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping to convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat.     In an inteview withs this week, USDA secretary Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat subsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out.  \n',25
'The results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies.     Results of the study, which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries, were provided tos by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified.     The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent, PSE.     The study shows that on dairy products Japan\'s PSE, or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged 83.3 pct over 1979-81, with the European Community at 68.8 pct and the United States 48.2 pct.     For wheat Japan\'s PSE averaged 95.8 pct, the EC 28.1 and the U.S. 17.2. Japan\'s rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC 13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.     In coarse grains, Japan\'s subsidies reached 107.1 pct compared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S. Japan\'s beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC and 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.     For sugar, Japan\'s PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.     The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC and Japan, the sources said.     Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing country producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD work.     Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May.     Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a  basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva.     British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.     He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture.     However, the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials familiar with the study said.     The U.S. Agriculture Department\'s Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.     In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECD\'s, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base period of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.     For example, the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49 pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.     French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale, citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC.     However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.     Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation.     The updated calculations, which may take several months to complete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S. subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.     U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials added.  \n',25
'The government\'s industry aid and protection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat industry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said.     The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid, he said in a statement.     He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire.     Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.     \"The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry\'s capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,\" he said.     \"The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry, as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time,\" he said.     Kerin was referring to the government\'s underwriting of the guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian Wheat Board near the start of the season.     The IAC\'s report will be due at the same time as the findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, Kerin said.     He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the federal and state governments and the industry.  \n',25

'A Portuguese court has made a preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders open to private importers, grain traders and officials said.     Under the terms of Portugal\'s January 1986 accession to the European Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.     Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first liberalised 20 pct share of the country\'s annual import needs. The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders.     Miguel Ascensao of ACICO tolds that Lisbon\'s civil court, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not be allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders.     Trade sources said the ruling, though effective immediately, was subject to appeal and would have to be confirmed in further proceedings.     A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said that, as a result of the court\'s decision, the Commission would not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being held today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn.     Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC\'s participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of Portugal\'s EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency\'s import monopoly.     It also said the participation of EPAC, which still controls the national grain storage and distribution network, was unfair competition to the private traders.     Traders said they believed the EC\'s Executive Commission was unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring to leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue.     \"They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile,\" one trader said.     ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if necessary.  \n',25

'Portugal\'s Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders.     Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders.     Under the terms of Portugal\'s January 1986 accession to the European Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.     Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon\'s civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done, in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports.     As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize.     Barreto said, \"My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part.\" He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders.     Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator, whether public or private, from the tenders. Private traders had argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them.     \"There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system,\" Barreto said. He said the EC\'s executive commission had accepted the government\'s view that EPAC should be eligible.     The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC\'s participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal\'s EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency\'s import monopoly.  \n',25

'Rain over wide areas has raised the prospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia, which suffered a disastrous drought and famine two years ago.     Aweke Aynalem, head of the government\'s Agriculture Development Department, told reporters prospects were good for attaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the present growing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia.     Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnes a year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the \"belg\" (small) rains which fall at this time of year.     The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops like maize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affects production in the main rainy season, because farmers eat their stocks of seed.     Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regions which suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow their crops because of the favourable rains.     The government had distributed large quantities of seed and fertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop.  \n',25

'Rice and corn farmers will receive the largest payments from the U.S. government during 1987 if the subsidies are calculated per planted acre, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     USDA said government outlays to rice farmers in 1987 are expected to reach 403 dlrs per acre planted, followed by corn at 135 dlrs per planted acre. Government outlays include mainly deficiency payments and price support loans.     On a per acre basis, cotton payments will reach 73.24 dlrs in 1987, wheat 60.30 dlrs, sorghum 54.38 dlrs, barley 27.41 dlrs and oats 2.31 dlrs, USDA said.     USDA estimates farm subsidies will reach 25.3 billion dlrs in 1987. The figures were given by USDA officials at a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing yesterday.  \n',25
'Graan Elevator Mij said its balance in port of grains, oilseeds and derivatives rose to 136,000 tonnes on March 7 from 31,000 a week earlier, after arrivals of 523,000 tonnes and discharges of 418,000 tonnes last week.     The balance comprised 38,000 tonnes of grains and oilseeds and 98,000 tonnes of derivatives.     This week\'s estimated arrivals total 194,000 tonnes, of which 45,000 are grains/oilseeds and 149,000 derivatives.

'Grain handling at Rotterdam port\'s main grain terminal was at a standstill today as members of the largest Dutch transport union FNV staged a lightning strike for the third day running.     Pieter van der Vorm, managing director of Graan Elevator Mij (GEM), which handles 95 pct of grain passing through the port, said their main Europoort terminal was out of action because of a strike by technical staff.     The actions, in support of union demands in negotiations over a new labour agreement, began on Wednesday when grain handlers stopped work.     Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today\'s scale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam would face delays, but this was not happening yet.     Wednesday\'s actions left GEM\'s facilities 40 pct operational, and there were only limited strikes yesterday.     Talks between unions and employers yesterday and today produced no result, but FNV spokesman Bert Duim said the union was prepared to put their key demand, for a 36 hour working week, at the bottom of the agenda.     Van der Vorm said, however, the union\'s demands on a range of issues were far in excess of the management\'s final offer.  \n',25

'Secretary of State George Shultz has decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the Agriculture Department, a State Department official said.     \"Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy last summer, and he\'s not going to the mat again. It\'s now basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what they want to do,\" the official said.     If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union, he said, \"Shultz will not wage a vigorous campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but he won\'t go to the President and voice his objections.\"     In an official statement clarifying Shultz\'s remarks yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers, the State Department said, \"Secretary Shultz expressed his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.     The Agriculture Department is in the best position to determine whether consideration should be given at this time to extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement Program.\"     Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to Moscow, the State Department official said.     \"Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy.\"     USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.     The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring U.S. prices down to competitive levels.     The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the State Department source said.     \"What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the lowest price being paid by anyone in the world,\" he said.     The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.     Government and commodity sources also said there are elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.     \"Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a foregone conclusion,\" the State Department official said.  \n',25
'Asked what the U.S. State Department\'s policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow, Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders that U.S. products must be competitive in the world market.     \"If we are going to sell our products, whatever they may be, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market,\" Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association of Wheat Growers.     \"We have to be competitive. It\'s ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren\'t,\" he said.     \"That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets, and it must be our approach as we look at the American farm program and try to figure out what we should do to make it better,\" Shultz told the Wheat Growers.     Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that would allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the American housewife, he realizes the importance of American agricultural products being competitively priced.     Speculation has been in the market for some time that the United States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Union at subsidized prices.     Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if it were competitively priced. Agriculture Department officials have declined to take any official position on the issue.  \n',25
'The Sichuan government has ordered that any work or meeting which interferes with the fight against drought must be cancelled or postponed to save time, energy and manpower, the People\'s Daily domestic edition said.     Sichuan is one of six provinces threatened by drought.     Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily, said the drought, the worst for more than 20 years, is affecting nearly two mln hectares in 100 counties in Sichuan, the country\'s biggest agricultural producer.     Sichuan has experienced temperatures three degrees Centigrade higher than normal and rainfall up to 70 pct less than normal since early February, affecting wheat, oil-bearing crops, rice planting and dryland cash crops, it said.     The paper said 43,000 hectares in Meixian county in Guangdong are seriously short of water.     The People\'s Daily said Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hebei are also suffering from drought.     Henan\'s grain output fell by 2.5 mln tonnes last year from the 1985 level because of drought which has been affecting the province since May.  \n',25

'Despite earlier optimistic indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage in its development and recent reports of heat stress could reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said South Africa\'s corn exports in the 1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct from the previous year.     The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a period of severe droughts, which at one point required South Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it said.     Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.     But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the department said.  \n',25

'The Soviet Communist Party has criticised the country\'s Grain Products Ministry for failing to ensure proper grain storage, turning out poor quality bread and for unsatisfactory book keeping, Pravda said.     The party daily said that losses in the industry owing to waste and theft amounted to 7.3 mln roubles over the last two and a half years.     The situation was particularly bad in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, which has been severely criticised since the ousting of its veteran leader Dinmukhamed Kunayev last December.     Its new leader, Gennady Kolbin, has said that at times the grain-growing republic has performed so badly that it has been obliged to seek grain supplies from national reserves.     Tass news agency announced yesterday that Grain Products Minister Grigory Zolotukhin, 75, was being retired and replaced by Alexander Budyka, a senior food industry official.     Pravda added today that the crisis in the industry had been drawn to Zolotukhin\'s attention and two of his deputies reprimanded.  \n',25
'Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.     Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said.     But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.     \"From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year),\" Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said.     The next six weeks in the USSR\'s grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.     \"Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us,\" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.     The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said.     With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.     Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.     \"Fall dryness may be a problem. There\'s a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness,\" Martell said.     Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said.     Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused  problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said.     Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said.     \"The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don\'t have to buy (grains) now,\" a USDA official said.     But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year\'s huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.     Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said.     \"A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half,\" Martell said.  \n',25
'Current interest by Soviet charterers in taking Panamax vessels on timecharter, mainly from the U.S. To carry grain, is seen as the chief factor behind the recent surge in values on the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange (BIFFEX), dealers said.     Futures soared through the 1,000 points barrier today for the first time in the spot position since the market opened in May 1985. However, the market tends to be nervous, with values some 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index, which is calculated on spot physical rates.     No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings but they have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage (about 50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw) from the U.S. Gulf which would normally operate on the trip to Japan, dealers said.     \"It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effect on its (the Soviet) grain harvest than reported,\" one said.     Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route have subsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering conditions, with very few, if any, Panamax sized ships left for the remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risen steadily for vessels loading next month.     Dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering taking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand.     Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chinese operators may be in the market for similar timecharter business later in the year, they said.     They anticipate this would appear around June and it has prompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract, despite it normally being a slack time in the shipping year.     Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Rates turned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which had supported the market at the start of the year, faltered but then recovered on the reported Soviet interest.  \n',25
'The Soviet Union featured prominently in U.K. Grain exports outside the EC for the period July 1/March 13, taking a combined total of 1.10 mln tonnes of wheat and barley out of all-destination U.K. Exports of 7.16 mln tonnes, the Home Grown Cereals Authority said, quoting provisional Customs and Excise figures.     The Soviet total comprises 634,000 tonnes of wheat and 472,000 tonnes of barley. Grain traders said the figures understate shipments already made by several thousand tonnes and they expect total U.K. Grain exports to the USSR this season to reach 2.5 mln tonnes, comprising 1.5 mln wheat/1.0 mln barley.  \n',25
'The Soviet Union is rumored this morning to have bought up to 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, export trade sources said.     The amount was not confirmed, but the talk was widespread through the trade. Gulf cash barge basis levels jumped two to three cents this morning on the rumors, which were expected to boost futures prices on today\'s open.     The Soviet Union recently bought over 1.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, ostensibly as a conciliatory gesture ahead of trade talks with U.S. agriculture officials.     Purchases rumored today were seen as a positive factor in light of a Soviet trade official\'s statement that the previous purchase had satisfied near-term needs.  \n',25
'The intensive technology concept for grain production has put a new floor under USSR grain production, the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s officer in Moscow said in a field report.

The U.S. Agriculture Department currently forecasts this year\'s USSR crop at 210.1 mln tonnes, and if realized this would be the third year since 1975 that the Soviet Union\'s grain harvest has exceeded 200.0 mln tonnes.

'Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the country\'s worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.     Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka\'s population in 13 districts.     The letter said the government had to step in \"to avert serious economic hardship\" and because the Social Services Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.     The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six month period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop was harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.     In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been \"almost completely devastated,\" the letter said. Maha paddy output was now estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally expected.     There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate rainfall within the next three to four weeks.     \"Should the present drought continue, however, production is estimated at around 20 mln bushels,\" the letter added.     Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90 and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last year\'s output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.     The letter said villagers in most seriously affected districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because subsidiary crops had also failed.     It said the government\'s current budget did not permit it to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected. \"Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue to exert pressure on the expenditure side.\"     The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per month for each family, as well as handling, transport and distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by the government would not be possible without seriously impairing development projects, or \"greatly fuelling inflation\" in the economy, the letter said.     The letter said the Food Department would be able to release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the immediate cereal requirements \"provided such stocks are replaced subsequently.\"     The Meteorological Department said the country was experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when the monsoon rains fell in late May.     The letter said some areas had been experiencing the drought since August, and in the rice growing district of Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June 1986.  \n',25

'Thailand\'s main paddy crop is expected to fall to 15.4 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 (Nov/Oct) season from a previous 15.68 mln estimate in November and an actual 17.35 mln a year ago, the Thai Rice Mills Association said.     It said a joint field survey late last month by the association, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand indicated that paddy output in Thailand\'s northeast region is lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces.     The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of 1986.     It said last November that the drought reduced total national areas sown with paddy to some 8.25 mln hectares this year, down from 8.84 mln a year ago.     The main crop represents about 85 pct of Thailand\'s paddy output.  \n',25
'Torrential rains throughout Argentina\'s grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.     Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May.     The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year\'s harvest.     Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires, with the heaviest rains in the province\'s western sectors, between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40 mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.     No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.     Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week\'s estimates.     Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.     Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.     Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates, or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year\'s volume, according to official figures.     The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area.     Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year\'s figure of 3.14 mln hectares.     Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985/86 harvest.     Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.     Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.     Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year\'s record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures put last year\'s soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.     Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.     Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year\'s harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares.  \n',25
'The European Community (EC) cereals trade lobby organisation Coceral said it has written to EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen to propose a new system for sales into intervention, which it claims could save the EC budget money.     It proposes that applications for intervention be made through a certificate valid for execution three months later. If during the three months the trader found a market elsewhere, he could buy back the certificate on payment of a one pct premium.     Coceral argues that this would restore the original function of intervention as a safety net and would end the present situation in which produce is often sold into intervention as a precaution.  \n',25
'The EC Commission granted 25,000 tonnes of free market barley export licences at today\'s tender and 80,000 tonnes of French maize, grain traders said.

'French operators last Friday requested licences to export 10,500 tonnes of free market maize, 11,950 tonnes of free market barley and 13,000 of soft wheat flour to non-EC countries, at prefixed daily (droit commun) rebates, French trade sources said.     The latest requests for the maize were for export to Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20 Ecu daily rebate.     The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries, in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recent dispute over grain sales to Spain.     If the latest French requests are accepted as expected, this will bring the total of French maize exported in this context to 25,500 tonnes.     The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the sale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.     Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheat flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an unchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.  \n',25

'Grain trade analysts expect a sharp drop in corn acreage, with most expecting a more modest decline in soybeans, in the U.S. Agriculture Department, USDA, plantings intentions report due out at 1500 est (2100 gmt).     The average trade guess for 1987 planted corn acreage was 66.06 mln acres, ranging from 60.7 to 69.0 mln, all well below the 76.67 mln planted last year due to improved incentives by the USDA for farmers to retire acres. Corn acres totalled only 60.22 mln in 1983, when the PIK program was introduced.     The average soybean planted acreage quesstimate was 59.49 mln, ranging from 58.0 to 63.0 mln and compared with the 61.48 mln planted in 1986     With substantial grain stocks, less interest was expressed among analysts in the USDA stocks report also scheduled today.  \n',25

'Three London markets which trade potato, soymeal and meat futures said they will merge to form a new Agricultural Futures Exchange.     Legal advisers have been instructed to implement the amalgamation of the London Potato Futures Association, LPFA, the London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE, and the Grain and Feed Trade Association\'s, GAFTA, Soya Bean Meal Futures Association, SOMFA. No timetable was given.     Members of the three exchanges have been consulted, Agricultural Futures Exchange secretary Bill Englebright tolds, and no objections have been raised to the merger.     Three markets are involved at present but the new exchange could ultimately combine five markets.     Discussions are taking place with the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange, BIFFEX, and the GAFTA London Grain Futures Market is considering the possibility of joining the other markets, market officials said.     The BIFFEX board is expected to reach a decision on the merger at its meeting at the end of this month, after members are consulted at a meeting on March 16.     The grain futures market also intends to consult its members soon, GAFTA director general James Mackie said.     The aim of the amalgamation is to limit regulatory and administrative costs and achieve the recognition required under the 1986 Financial Services Act. This legislation requires a futures market to become a Recognised Investment Exchange, RIE, for trading to continue.     Representatives of all the futures markets on the Baltic Exchange have been discussing the possibility of a single RIE structure since the beginning of the year.     The new exchange now planned will apply to the Securities and Investments Board for recognition as an RIE \"at the appropriate time,\" the Agricultural Futures Exchange said.     \"This commitment by the markets will enable progress to be made to develop a stronger and more effective exchange to the benefit of all those involved in the industry,\" the chairman of the formation committee, Pat Elmer, said.

'The U.K. Exported 517,600 tonnes of wheat and 315,800 tonnes of barley in the first 25 days of March, the Home Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA) said, quoting provisional Customs and Excise figures.     This brought combined wheat and barley exports since the season started on July 1 to 7.60 mln tonnes, substantially up on the 4.02 mln exported in the same 1985/86 period.     This season\'s total comprises 3.94 mln tonnes of wheat and 3.66 mln barley, compared with 1.63 mln and 2.39 mln, respectively, a year ago.  \n',25
'A total of 14,685 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat were sold at today\'s tender for the home market, the Home Grown Cereals Authority said.

'Britain and Australia have offered a total of 129,250 tonnes of wheat to Bangladesh as grants to contain rising cereal prices and help support rural employment projects, officials said.     They said 79,250 tonnes of wheat promised by Britain would be shipped next week and used for the government\'s \"Food for Work\" program in the villages.     Under the program, workers building roads, digging irrigation canals and engaged in other rural development activities get their daily wages in wheat instead of money.     The 50,000 tonnes of Australian wheat would arrive in Bangladesh next month and be sold under open-market operations designed to stop price increases, the officials said.     Prices of rice and wheat have risen at least 15 pct in the past month, market sources said. But the government expects prices to fall after the wheat harvest next month.  \n',25
'The Reagan administration\'s cabinet-level Economic Policy Council is scheduled to meet Friday to discuss, among other issues, the status of agricultural legislation, administration officials said.     The officials said discussion of a U.S. Agriculture Department wheat export subsidy to the Soviet Union was not on the agenda. Matters not on the agenda, however, can be brought before the council, the officials said.     Grain trade officials have speculated that USDA would make a wheat export enhancement offer to Moscow, but USDA officials have said the matter is not under active consideration.     USDA today transmitted to Congress a package of legislative proposals, including bills that would cut target prices and speed up loan rate reductions.  \n',25
'The Senate Agriculture Committee is expected to take up a bill tomorrow that would exempt from government conservation regulations those farmers who have rotated alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes with row crops, committee staff said.     Under current so-called \"sodbuster\" law, farmers who planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highly erodible land in the years 1981 through 1985 lose federal farm program benefits if they produce a row crop on that land in later years.     Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.), sponsor of the measure, said recently that those crop rotating practices resulted in less erosion than the practices of many farmers who produced strictly row crops.  \n',25
'Grain traders and analysts look for a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up in the USDA\'s conservation reserve program, scheduled to be announced after 1400 CST today.     The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the acres submitted, they said.     Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is only 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year has underpinned new crop corn futures all week.     However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted by farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservation program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total corn production will be minimal, they added.  \n',25
'U.S. corn acreage this year is  likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years, Agriculture Department officials said.     USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31. Agriculture Department analysts said next week\'s figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres, down 22 pct from last year\'s plantings of 83.3 mln acres.     Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. corn production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels.     Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain analysts said.     \"There\'s no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage,\" one said. \"It\'s difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year.\"     Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.     Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they said, compared to last year\'s level of 61.5 mln acres.     If analysts\' unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.     Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2 billion bushels.     Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels, down from last year\'s crop of 8.3 billion bushels.     \"This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production,\" an analyst said.     A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S. corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not increase significantly, a specialist said.     High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions, based upon historical participation in government programs, analysts said.     In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.     \"Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,\" he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher-producing delta areas.     Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year\'s 2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.     U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has steadily declined in the 1980\'s.     U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.     Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 119.3 bushels per acre.     \"We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so,\" an analyst said.     Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts said.     Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage.     \"To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to provide more incentives,\" an analyst said.  \n',25
'The recent purchase of 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn by Japan and 600,000 tonnes by South Korea suggests that the two countries\' demand for reliable supplies of corn is increasing, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in exportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over the availability of South African and Chinese corn.     With these corn purchases, Japan is committed to buying 7.7 mln tonnes of U.S. corn in 1986/87 (Sept-Aug), nearly 400,000 tonnes greater than year-ago figures to date.     South Korea\'s cumulative commitments amount to 2.5 mln tonnes, up 1.5 mln compared to last year, it said.  \n',25
'Canada\'s ruling in favor of a duty on U.S. corn was a keen disappointment to the National Corn Growers Association and has set a dangerous precedent for other nations to follow, said Mike Hall, lobbyist for the association.     \"The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now and just change corn to corn gluten feed\" in their complaint, Hall tolds.     A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farm policies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers and supported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85 cts per bushel.     \"This was cleary a political decision,\" Hall said. \"The amount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant.\"     The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument that Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices and that American farm policy has driven down these prices, thus causing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger government payments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said.     Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but that other nations might also now apply this same argument to attack U.S. farm programs.     The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farm programs create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hall said. The French have long wanted to control the imports of U.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that the imported feed was unfairly displacing European grain.  \n',25
'Recent purchases of U.S. corn by the Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said.     Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a dealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain.     By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales, where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed.     If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement would break the Gulf corn basis.     \"The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county posted prices,\" one dealer said. \"It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City,\" which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest.     \"But we don\'t know when they might do it,\" an Ohio dealer said, which has created uncertainty in the market.     The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage.     Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates it has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to date been exchanged for grain.     With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said.     A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest to the export terminals, cash dealers said.     Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening of the mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.     The higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings, they said.     \"The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,\" which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much as 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain trader said.     But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside, freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the Midwest river system.  \n',25
'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter suggested the U.S. could file a formal complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) challenging Canada\'s decision to impose duties on U.S. corn imports.     Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn shipments, Yeutter said the U.S. could file a formal complaint with GATT under the dispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code.     Other U.S. options would be to appeal the decision in Canadian courts, or to retaliate against Canadian goods, a lower-level U.S. trade official said. However, retaliation is an unlikely step, at least initially, that official said. No decision on U.S. action is expected at least until after documents on the ruling are received here later this week.  \n',25
'The Senate this week might take up proposed legislation that could serve as a lightning rod to expose broad initiatives to change U.S. farm policy.     The Senate could consider a House-passed bill that would allow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pct of their income support payments if flooding last year prevented, or will prevent, them from planting their 1987 crops, Senate staff members tolds.     Also pending is a bill extend the life of the National Commission on Dairy Policy.     Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., intends to offer an amendment to one of the bills that would suspend the minimum planting requirement for all 1987 wheat, feedgrain, cotton and rice producers, an aide said.     Under current law, producers must plant at least 50 pct of their base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of their deficiency payments.     Most major U.S. farm groups have lobbied hard against making any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out of fear a full-scale debate could expose agricultural problems to budget-cutting pressures.     Representatives of these farm groups have said they also fear efforts by Midwestern Democrats to force a floor vote on a bill that would require large acreage set-asides in return for sharply higher support prices.     However, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, sponsor of the bill, tolds he did not intend to offer his measure as a floor amendment but to bring it through the committee.  \n',25
'An American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) official said that far from hurting Canadian corn producers, U.S. farm programs benefit all foreign producers.     AFBF president Dean Kleckner made the comments in response to the ruling earlier today by the Canadian Import Tribunal that subsidized U.S. corn imports were injurious to Canadian growers. The tribunal upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S. cents a bushel.     \"Farm Bureau specialists went to Ottawa and testified previous U.S. farm programs have actually benefited all foreign producers by reducing the amount of corn grown in the U.S. (and losing market share), while exerting an upward influence on the price of corn Worldwide,\" he said.  \n',25
'U.S. farmers who reorganize their operations to circumvent a cap on federal payments could add 2.3 billion dlrs to the cost of the government\'s agricultural programs by 1989, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said.     \"We estimate that should the trend in farm reorganizations continue, reorganizations since 1984 could be adding almost 900 mln dlrs annually to program costs by 1989,\" GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley said.     \"Cumulative costs for the six-year period, 1984 to 1989, could approach 2.3 billion dlrs,\" he said.

The USDA is to release its 1987 planting intentions report March 31.     The survey included 15 soybean estimates and 13 corn estimates and was released in the March 16 Soybean Update newsletter sent to members.

'The use of generic commodity certificates, or \"certs,\" for fiscal years 1986-88 will save the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs, Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said.     Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on the use of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 could result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs.     However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450 to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in net savings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said.     Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly the entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been forfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC.     In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have been redeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges would have remained in the goverment inventory, he said.     When asked to comment on a recent study by the General Accounting Office that concluded certificates result in a net cost to the government, Amstutz said, \"GAO underestimated the benefits and overstated the costs\" of the certificate program.     Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan entries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather than forfeitures.     GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said.     \"There is no question in the mind of the Department of Agriculture that these certificates have been very useful,\" Amstutz said.     Immediate benefits of certificates include greater market liquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farm income, and improved debt situation and decreased carrying costs, he said.     Certificates are an integral part of USDA\'s long-range market-oriented farm policy, he said.     Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kans., that USDA is in the process of preparing an official response to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it to the subcommittee when completed.  \n',25
'A statement yesterday by Secretary of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market levels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.     They said that Shultz\'s comments, while not explicitly endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy because they were not negative towards such action.     In response to a query on what the State Department\'s position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.     The Soviet Union, the world\'s largest grain importer, has bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.     Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet Union, grain industry sources said.     Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel, while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.     \"I\'m not sure this is an about-face, but it\'s clearly a recognition that unless we\'re competitive, we won\'t sell to the Soviet Union,\" said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.     \"We have to be competitive. It\'s ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else,\" Shultz told the farm leaders. \"That is our approach in negotiations with the Soviets,\" he said.     If those comments do signal that the State Department is no longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP, it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to Moscow, an industry lobbyst said.     National Wheat Grower\'s officials were taking a cautious attitude towards the secretary\'s comments.     \"His comments were not discouraging, but they didn\'t in our judgment promise any immediate action on EEP,\" an official with the wheat group said.     The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that \"there is significance in that fact that we haven\'t seen any significant negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets.\"     In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the officials said.     An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets, said that the Shultz comments \"are consistent with what he (Shultz) has taught for years as an economist,\" but said they don\'t necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.     Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz\'s statements.     But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.     \"If he didn\'t say no, then there\'s a chance. This is potentially a positive development,\" a commodity source said.  \n',25
'The U.S. House Agriculture Committee approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union.     The proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year.     In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee approved several proposals which could restrict imports of lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Those amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them, Congressional sources said.     The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than the current three years through fiscal 1988.     The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion now.     Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct less expensive to operate.     The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administration make an offer, but urges such action.     The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to begin discussions with other major grain producing countries aimed at jointly reducing world grain production.     Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work.     Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said.     Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of casein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New Zealand and Ireland.     The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S. beef imports.     Other miscellaneous amendments included:     -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove restrictions on beef imports.     -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to 800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now.     -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.     -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the National Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a Canadian countervailing duty case this year.     -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax.     -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National Commission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a reorganization of USDA\'s trade policy apparatus.  \n',25
'A proposal by two U.S. House Democrats to target government farm benefits to small- and medium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a House subcommittee today.     \"On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen,\" said Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. \"This is the first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative to the (Reagan) administration\'s farm proposal.\"     The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not more than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.     The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20 pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.     Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five years, protect family farms and eliminate government accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be halted.     However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would \"involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a family farmer is.\"     Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.     Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and therefore eligible for payments.  \n',25
'The U.S. Is to lend Sudan 57 mln dlrs to buy 309,000 tonnes of wheat and 73,000 tonnes of wheat flour, according to an agreement signed here.     Under the agreement Sudan will receive 50 mln dlrs for the commodities and the rest for sea transportation.     The loan is repayable in 40 years, including a 10-year grace period. Interest will be two pct for the grace period and three pct over the repayment period of 30 years.  \n',25
'A marketing loan for U.S. wheat, feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus production situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) said.     \"I think I would not support a marketing loan now,\" he told the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused support on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.     A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more production, especially in high-yielding areas, would be much more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans and not increase exports significantly, he said.  \n',25
'A majority of the Senate Agriculture Committee urged President Reagan to reverse his opposition to export subsidies to the Soviet Union as a way to get its negotiators to purchase some 500 mln dlrs in American wheat.     The group, led by committee chairman Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, urged Reagan to step up negotiations with the Soviet Union by providing export subsidies to help U.S. farmers.  \n',25
'The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee approved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted alfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and 1985 from a federal conservation requirement.     Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D-Neb., said his bill would restore equity under federal sodbuster rules, which currently deny farm program benefits to farmers who, between 1981 and 1985, planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without interrupting the plantings with a row crop.     An official from a leading conservation group, who asked not to be identified, said the panel\'s move was \"an unfortunate first action\" because it could lead to the exemption of potentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations, established under the 1985 farm bill.  \n',25
'The upcoming five-month deficiency payments to corn and sorghum farmers will be made half in cash and half in generic commodity certificates, a senior Agriculture Department official tolds.     Around 300 mln dlrs of the in-kind certificates, or \"certs,\" will be mailed out to farmers around March 15 or 16, Tom von Garlem, Assistant Deputy Administrator for USDA\'s state and county operations, said.     The decision to make the payments in a 50/50 cash/certs ratio was made Monday, but payments to producers will be delayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDA\'s computer program, von Garlem said. get 11.5 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 5.75 cts in certs and around 5.5 cts cash (5.75 cts minus Gramm-Rudman).     Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments at signup will receive 63 cts per bushel. Slightly more than half of this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he said this will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since most farmers got advance payments.     \"The final certificate payments will be very close to 300 mln dlrs,\" he said.     When asked if the Office of Management and Budget had resisted the cash/certs ratio, the USDA official said that \"we proposed 50/50 and OMB accepted it.\"  \n',25
'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. exporters when he visits that country next month.     In an interview withs, Lyng also said the Reagan administration will ask Tokyo to remove its quotas on U.S. beef and citrus exports.     Lyng, who plans to be in Japan April 14-27, said he will not ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market. \"We will urge that they consider sharing their rice market,\" he said.     The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of the Japanese rice market the U.S. would request. \"We\'ve got none of it now. If we got one per cent of it, it would be a big improvement,\" he said.     Last year, the Reagan administration rejected a petition by the U.S. rice industry seeking relief from Japanese import restrictions.     However, the U.S. said it would reexamine the issue if by mid-1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to U.S. rice exports.     Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiations next month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas, but that his visit \"may be a forerunner in a general way\" to talks prior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988.     He said, however, that the U.S. \"will ask for a definite liberalization of those items (beef and citrus).... When you translate \'liberalization\' into Japanese, it means do away with the quota.\"  \n',25
'The U.S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA officials said.     However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in the very near future.     \"The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,\" an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. \"But there just isn\'t much talk about it, informally or formally.\"     Most analysts interviewed bys were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week.     But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, it could take several months.     \"I just don\'t see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process,\" the aide to Lyng said.     \"An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,\" said one former USDA official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program.     An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets.     But Lyng\'s aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time.     The administration\'s interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials at the U.S. Trade Representative\'s Office said.     In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration\'s previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of \"calm, basic, factual economics.\"     Another USDA official said there was \"not even an informal suggestion or hint\" that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms.     USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair.  \n',25
'The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has switched 25.0 mln dlrs in wheat credit guarantees to Jordan under the Export Credit Guarantee Program to the Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee Program, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The switch reduces the total value of GSM-102 guarantees for the current fiscal year to 30.0 mln dlrs.     The credit terms extended for export sales under the Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103) must be in excess of three years but not more than seven years.

'All major grain producing countries must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S. wheat organizations said.     The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions, \"but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions\" on world grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the two organizations said      While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments.     Australia\'s proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and \"quarantine\" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers, they said.       Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.     \"We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers,\" Jim Miller, president of NAWG said.     \"We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world\'s major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture,\" Miller said.  \n',25
'The National Association of Wheat Growers, NAWG, board of directors is scheduled to meet Secretary of State George Schultz and Undersecretary of State Allen Wallis to discuss the Department\'s current role in farm trade policy, the association said.     NAWG President Jim Miller said in a statement that the organization wanted to convey to Secretary Schultz the importance that exports hold for U.S. agriculture and the degree to which farmers are dependent upon favorable State Department trade policies to remain profitable.     \"Foreign policy decisions of the U.S. State Department have in the past severely hampered our efforts to move our product to overseas markets,\" he said.     Miller noted Secretary Schultz is scheduled to meet next month with representatives of the Soviet Union, and the NAWG \"wanted to be certain the secretary was aware of our concerns regarding the reopening of wheat trade with the Soviet Union.\"     The annual spring NAWG board of directors meeting is held in Washington to allow grower-leaders from around the country to meet with their state congressional delegations and members of the executive branch.

'The U.S. National Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG) urged the Reagan administration offer the Soviet Union wheat under the export enhancement program (eep).     In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, NAWG stated its \"strong support\" for an eep offer to Moscow.     \"We believe that a solid case continues to exist for Soviet EEP eligibility, and the recently announced and reported Soviet purchases of U.S. corn indicate a Soviet willingness to purchase U.S. grain if it is competitively priced,\" NAWG said.     \"Consequently, we believe it is important to renew the U.S. eep offer and do all that is reasonably possible to ensure mutual adherence to the terms of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement,\" the letter said.  \n',25
'U.S. Agriculture undersecretary Dan Amstutz indicated the United States is willing talk with the Soviet Union about the competitiveness of U.S. wheat prices but would not discuss making U.S. wheat prices \"cheap.\"     \"There sometimes is a difference between being competitive and being cheap,\" Amstutz told a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing.     Amstutz said the difference of opinion between Moscow and Washington last summer on the level of the U.S. subsidy offered on wheat to the Soviet Union, was over whether the U.S. wheat price was competitive or cheap.     \"I think there is a (U.S.) willingness to explore this issue as it pertains to competitiveness,\" Amstutz said.     However, Amstutz added that the United States would not be willing to discuss wheat prices with Moscow \"if the issue is being cheap.\"     Asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinction between competitive and cheap, Amstutz would not elaborate.     Amstutz said it is the U.S. judgment that the long-term grain agreement between the two countries calls for Moscow to buy at least four mln tonnes each of wheat and corn annually at \"prices in effect in this country.\"     Amstutz made the comments in response to a question from Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, about expanding the export enhancement program to include grain sales to the Soviet Union.  \n',25
'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he was not sure a long-term U.S.-Soviet grain agreement would be worth extending when it expires next year.     \"It hasn\'t been worth much in the last two years....They haven\'t lived up to the agreement as I see it,\" Lyng said in an interview withs.     \"It would be my thought that it\'s not worth any effort to work out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to be a one-sided thing,\" he said.     However, Lyng said he did not want to make a \"definitive commitment one way or another at this point.\"     Under the accord covering 1983-88, the Soviets agreed to buy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mln tonnes each of corn and wheat.     Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes of wheat during the third agreement year, which ended last September, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.     Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscow would buy this year.     \"I\'ve seen people making comments on that and I don\'t know how they know, unless they talk to the Soviets,\" he said. \"I have no knowledge, and I really don\'t think anyone other than the Soviets have any knowledge.\"     Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought U.S. corn last month because \"they needed it and because the price was right.\"     \"Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced.

'Abnormally warm and dry weather over most parts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China News Agency said.     It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing areas, it said.     The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than seven months.     The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March, lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and consumers.     The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said.     The drought has also increased the number of forest fires. More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340 hectares of forest by mid-February, it said.  \n',25

Earlier this year USDA extended the deadline to April 1 from March 1, Sitter said.     ASCA Administrator Milton Hertz said in a statement that the extension was necessary because of heavy workloads at county ASCS offices.

Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexico and Italy, it said.     Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4 times the previous week\'s marketing year low, but six pct less than the four week average.     Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown destinations.

Wheat sales to China of 60,000 tonnes were switched from 1986/87 to the 1987/88 season, it noted.     Soybean sales of 483,100 tonnes were 11 pct above the prior week and two-thirds above the four-week average.     Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico and Portugal were the main buyers, the department said.     Soybean cake and meal sales of 289,400 tonnes were two-thirds above the previous week and the largest of the marketing year, with Venezuela the dominant purchaser.     Sales activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 4,400 tonnes, as reductions for unknown destinations more than offset increases for Canada, the Dominican Republic and Panama, the department said.     Cotton sales of 57,900 running bales -- 43,800 bales for the current year and 14,200 bales for the 1987/88 season -- were off 25 pct from the previous week and 50 pct from the four-week average.     Turkey, Thailand, South Korea and Canada were the major buyers for the current season, while Thailand, Britain and Japan were the major purchasers from the upcoming season, the department said.      Sorghum sales of 178,800 tonnes were two-thirds above the prior week and 75 pct over the four-week average.     Venezuela was the leading buyer it said.     Sales of 41,800 tonnes of barley were 10 times the previous week and 10 pct greater than  the four-week average. Israel, Cyprus and Saudi Arabia were the main buyers, it said.  \n',25
'No changes have been made or are being planned in the Agriculture Department\'s calculation of price differentials between interior grain locations and the Texas Gulf, a senior USDA official said.     Ralph Klopfenstein, USDA deputy administrator for commodity operations, tolds, \"We do not anticipate any changes to be made\" in the Texas Gulf differentials used to calculate posted county prices for corn.     \"We do not relate the Texas Gulf structure with the Louisiana Gulf structure at all. It\'s a totally different situation,\" he said.     Rumors had circulated through the market this morning that USDA had widened Texas Gulf differentials in a similar manner to last weekend\'s adjustments with the Louisiana Gulf.  \n',25
'Farmers enrolled over 6.5 mln acres of program crops in the latest conservation reserve program signup and around four mln acres of non-program crops, Agriculture Department conservation specialists said.     Soybean acreage amounted to less than two mln acres of the non-program crop acreage enrolled, a USDA analyst said. Heavy enrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states, of which a big percentage would be fallow and non-soybean land, accounted for a large portion of the non-program acreage, the analyst said.     Wheat and corn acreage comprised slightly over 40 pct of the total 10,572,402 acres accepted into the ten-year program.     USDA analysts gave the following enrollment breakdown:     -- wheat  2,615,140 acres     -- corn   1,894,764 acres     -- barley   705,888 acres     -- sorghum  585,552 acres     -- cotton   417,893 acres     -- rice       2,035 acres     -- peanuts      611 acres     -- tobacco      285 acres     -- total program crops  6,512,700 acres     -- total nonprogram     4,059,702 acres     -- total enrollment    10,572,402 acres     USDA analysts are currently working on a complete state breakdown of crop acreage enrollment and should have it ready for publication later this week, they said.  \n',25

'The Agriculture Department is not considering any major changes in its pricing system for posted county prices, an Agriculture Department offical said.     \"We do not have current plans to make any major adjustments or changes in our pricing,\" said Bob Sindt, USDA assistant deputy administrator for commodity operations.     U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement.     But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes.     \"If people are suggesting that we are going to make wholesale changes in pricing, we are not considering this,\" he said.     Sindt, however, did not rule out the possiblity of implementing more minor changes in its pricing system.     \"We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide structure to maintain its accuracy,\" he said. \"If we become convinced that we need to make a change, then appropriate adjustments will be made.\"     Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA\'s price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge freight rates.     He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week.     Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that meeting, including the current concern over the gulf corn premiums.     He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these price margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or decrease.     The USDA official also said that only those counties that use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices.     When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space and accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discounted the idea.     He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and that, under provisions of the program, these all have to be emptied by the end of March.  \n',25

The Commodity Credit Corp will \"depend heavily\" on certificates to relieve storage problems this year, Ralph Klopfenstein, Deputy Administrator for Commodity Operations, USDA, told participants at the National Grain and Feed Association\'s annual convention.     Klopfenstein said that CCC will not be able to relocate grain in any significant amount this fall, so certificates will be used in various programs to relieve storage tightness.     Klopfenstein said certificates meet the goal of allowing prices to go below loan levels and providing USDA with an inventory management tool.  \n',25
'The U.S. Agriculture Department increased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from last month\'s projection of 23 mln tonnes.     In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA said the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the U.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and coarse grain from other major suppliers.     USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up one mln from last month\'s estimate and 700,000 tonnes below the preliminary 1985/86 figure.     Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mln tonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along with a dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and a cold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.     USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightly from the previous January\'s level, while milk production increased by nearly six pct.     Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases in roughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestock production from expanding as much as it did a year earlier, USDA said.  \n',25

In the latest signup, farmers on 101,020 farms submitted bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres.     The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 51.17 dlrs per acre.     Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will be ineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted with permanent vegetative cover.     Producers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn \"bonus\" rental payment that was offered by USDA.     The corn bonus, to be paid in generic comodity certificates, amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the ASCS program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn based accepted into the reserve.     The state showing the biggest enrollment in the conservation program during this signup was Texas with approximately 1.225 mln acres, followed by Iowa with 1.030 mln acres, Minnesota with 890,000 acres, Montana 875,000 acres, and Kansas with 842,000 acres.

'The Soviet Union has been a heavy buyer of Yugoslav corn since October, purchasing close to 1.5 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a report from the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belgrade.     Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this sold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Association reported to the U.S. official.     In a report dated March 10, the official said that about 800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balance of 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June.     An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from July-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslav corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said.     Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for exporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said.     Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged around 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlier estimates of 150,000, the official said.     The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav corn sales during this marketing year, he said.  \n',25
'The Soviet Union will likely honor its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department official said.     \"They have always honoured the agreement, and there\'s no reason now to think they won\'t this year,\" he tolds.     \"They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European Community, from Canada, from the U.S. They\'re active buyers from all sources at this point,\" the official said in explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.     This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for the first time in 15 years.     A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S. corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow\'s recent interest.     Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan, and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the official said.     \"The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists\" and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. \"As soon as they need corn, they\'ll buy it,\" he added.     USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.     The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets would enter the U.S. market again.     \"There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of frenetic buying now,\" the official said.     However, the situation in wheat is \"a different story,\" he said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.     Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S. is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation.   \n',25
'The Reagan administration continues to debate whether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, but would need assurances from the Soviets that they would buy the wheat before the subsidy offer would be made, a senior U.S. Agriculture Department official said.     \"I think it still is under active debate whether or not it would be advisable\" to make an the export enhancement offer to the Soviets, Thomas Kay, administrator of the department\'s Foreign Agriculture Service, tolds.     \"We\'d need some assurances from them (the Soviets) that they would buy if offered\" the wheat under the subsidy plan, he said. Kay called reports that such an offer was imminent \"premature.\"     The Reagan administration\'s cabinet-level Economic Policy Council is set to meet today to discuss, among other matters, agricultural policy but is not expected to address a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviet Union, administration officials said earlier.  \n',25
'Grain trade representatives continued to speculate that the Reagan administration will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. Agriculture Department officials said there was no substance to the reports.     \"It\'s pure fiction,\" said one senior official at USDA\'s Foreign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that the administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow in the next two to three weeks.     An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the speculation, which he said was started by \"somebody fanning the (wheat) market.\" Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on the basis of the speculation.     One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as much as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it before mid-year, if it was \"competitively priced.\"     Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet trading organization, tolds he had no information to substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, but said that Moscow \"would consider\" buying U.S. wheat if it was competitively priced.     \"We don\'t care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) are looking for is competitive prices,\" Ivlev said. \"If they (the administration) are interested in selling it (wheat), they should find ways to do it.\"  \n',25

'Unfavorable late winter weather conditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop, the U.S. embassy\'s agricultural officer in Belgrade said.     The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade to Subotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell that followed a period of warm weather.     He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.     Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of which show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf and possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.     The report said that since much of the early growth in February was from late seeding rather than from normal development, his view was that the damage may be more extensive than some local observers say.     The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields on normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin and chances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.     However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable and many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which would aid recovery.  \n',25
'Winter kill has probably affected West German winter barley and rapeseed to an above average degree this season, West German grain trader Alfred C. Toepfer said in its latest report.     It is too soon to assess the extent of the damage, but it is likely that northern West German crops are particularly at risk because of insufficient snow cover, it said.     The soil needs to warm up rapidly and moisture content must improve to avoid further delays to spring field work, it added.  \n',25
'Western Canada\'s resource-based economy is being hurt by international market forces and there is little Ottawa can do about it, Finance Minister Michael Wilson said.     \"If you can tell me how we can get the international energy price up and how we can get the price for copper up and how we can get the price for wheat up, then we will listen,\" Wilson told the House of Comnons Finance Committee.     Although under pressure from oil companies and wheat farmers for help in battling depressed commodity prices, Wilson said it has to be recognized the area was a \"prisoner of market forces outside the boundaries of this country.\"     Wilson, appearing before the committee to discuss the government\'s spending estimates released earlier this week, said the government is doing what it can in the region, citing more than 3.5 billion dlrs in aid for western agriculture.     \"Those resources are a reflection of very real concerns on our part in dealing with a very difficult problem,\" Wilson said in response to questions about management of the economy from opposition party members.     He said the long term answer for depressed regions of the country was reaching a free trade pact with the United States, which he claimed would improve the outlook for Western Canada.  \n',25
'Shifts from mild to very cold weather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sown winter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, the U.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said.     In a field report, the officer said indications were that winter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared with 38,000 last year.     He said the damage was probably more limited in southern and central regions and most widespread in the north.     Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where little or no snow cover was present, he added.     The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well developed plants and for winter barley.     Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing water occurred in the fields.     The officer said repairing damage will probably call for special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and where stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timed applications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added.  \n',25
'World grain trade could be turning the corner and heading toward recovery in the 1986-87 season, a Cargill, Inc. analyst said.     Writing in the March issue of the Cargill Bulletin, David Rogers of Cargill\'s Commodity Marketing Division cited a gradual rise in world wheat trade in recent months, with a slow rise in wheat prices after recent historic lows.     He said the wheat trade, because wheat can be produced in many nations, is a good barometer of world grain trade and could lead to more activity in other grain markets.     Rogers said that with world grain prices at their lowest level in over a quarter of a century in real terms, demand has begun to rise while producing nations are re-examining their expensive price-support policies and reducing planted acres.  \n',25
'There was no evidence of winterkill in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s counselor in Belgrade said in a field report.     The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall because of dry conditions.     However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on last fall\'s late seeding, it said.     Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the report said.     Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage under these conditions, they said.     The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it emerged from winter.  \n',25

'Zambia\'s marketed maize production will probably fall to less than 630,000 tonnes in 1986/87 (May-Apr), from 918,000 last year, because of poor rainfall in major producing areas, Agriculture Minister Kingsley Chinkuli said.     He told Parliament that in the southern provinces the harvest would be over 50 pct down on the level in the previous marketing year.     \"The nation would be lucky to produce over seven mln bags (630,000 tonnes) of maize this year,\" he stated.

'Congress should give the U.S. Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean loan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export competitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said.     Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out of the current soybean program \"dilemma\" would be for Congress to allow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if the loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to further buydown the loan rate.     Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be less than 4.77 dlrs per bu.     Amstutz\' suggestion would be for Congress to change the farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56 dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs.     The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the 4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut.     Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on soybean program changes will be the budget costs.     He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that the U.S. loan rate provides an \"umbrella\" to foreign production and causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans.     Asked about the American Soybean Association\'s request for some form of income support, Amstutz said \"the competitive problem is the most severe.\" He said USDA is still studying the situation and \"no resolution\" has yet been found.  \n',25
'France supports the European Commission\'s plans for a European Community (EC) fats and oils tax but objects to some of its oilseeds proposals, Yves Van Haecke, an aide to French agriculture minister Francois Guillaume said.     He told a general assembly of France\'s Oilseeds Federation (FFCOP) that a suppression of monthly increases of oilseed support prices, for example, was unacceptable.     French oilseeds experts added the principle of a single tax regardless of varying quality was clumsy and capable of unneccessarily alienating exporters such as the U.S.  \n',25

'Several leading farm-state Congressmen said they will press the U.S. Agriculture Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income.     Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen and representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the subject in the next two weeks.     \"Let\'s see if we can try to push them (USDA) to do something without legislation,\" Glickman told the hearing.     The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs per bushel with no income protection, or marketing loan.     David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, president said USDA must make changes in the soybean program.     The current soybean program \"gave us the worst of both worlds,\" ASA\'s Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate is too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of soybean production in South America, he said. At the same time, the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income support for soybean farmers, Haggard said.     \"We need some kind of market loan,\" he added.     The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA so far has resisted pressure to use the authority.     Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA, but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they would seriously consider offering a marketing loan.     USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the soybean situation is a \"dilemna\" which has been studied extensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any changes, are under consideration.     In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other than a marketing loan which should be considered to help soybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment, or a direct payment program.     Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will rise to 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of soybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year.     \"Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil\'s entire soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987,\" Haggard said.     However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in making soybean program changes that might allow the European Community to challenge the U.S. program under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.     He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean production and loss of that market would be devastating.     The Reagan administration has given \"mixed signals\" on whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be successfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said.     While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu loan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorsed a proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a six dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.     The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois.     Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take some action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loan could mean a substantial increase in budget costs.     Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one to 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget.     Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu combined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price might fall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost the government a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costs would decline as market prices recovered.  \n',25
'The European Community\'s (EC) executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of its ambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farm surpluses, after strong attacks from northern states.     Britain and West Germany, backed by the Netherlands and Denmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which has already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC led by the U.S. and from EC consumer groups, diplomats said.     But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen told journalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the tax, proposed last month as part of the Commission\'s annual farm price package, would leave a large hole in the group\'s budget.     He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind up for good. \"I hope the debate is still open, if not there will be a formidable hole in the budget,\" he said.     The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and would be only slightly less this year, he said.     Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead of farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as unprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministers recognised the importance of reforming the EC\'s farm policy.     The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extra cash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels and to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by making it more competitive with other oils.     Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oil producers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by the tax.     \"What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be better understood not just outside the community but at home,\" he said.     Britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the EC\'s costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal to impose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats could seriously damage the EC\'s trade relations with other countries.     Britain also warned that the tax could hit developing countries already receiving aid from the EC, they said.     The Commission also defended proposals to dismantle Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross border subsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism.     In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to EC executive Commission President, Jacques Delors, Kohl made clear such a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers.     Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism at the talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany had been alone in its opposition. The question was a key aspect of the Commission\'s farm price proposals, he added.    Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid the EC of its butter mountain, despite Spanish and Portuguese opposition.     The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of unwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning it into animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices.     National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of savings from another plan to curb milk production.     Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by the scheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massive surpluses built up before they joined the community last year, but the two countries did not block today\'s vote.  \n',25
'The outcome of negotiations on proposals by the European Commission for a 330 Ecus a tonne tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds and marine oils remains difficult to predict, Belgian agriculture minister Paul de Keersmaeker told a news conference.     De Keersmaeker, who chaired a meeting of EC farm ministers which ended today, was asked about reports enough countries were against the tax to ensure that it would be defeated in negotiations on the EC farm price package for 1987/88.     He said it was true some countries were strongly opposed, but others were less so and others basically in favour.     \"I think there is room for negotiations, and I would not want to make any predictions at this stage,\" de Keersmaeker said.     Yesterday, British minister Michael Jopling said Britain, West Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands and Denmark were opposed to the measure. Between them these countries have more than enough voting power to block it.     Diplomatic sources said at today\'s meeting the Spanish delegation also expressed strong reservations about the idea.  \n',25
'Soybean imports are forecast to rise to 425,000 tonnes in 1987/88 (October/September) from an estimated 300,000 in 1986/87 and 375,000 in 1985/86, the U.S. Embassy said in its annual report on Indonesia\'s agriculture.     It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target.     Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000 tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000 tonnes in 1985/86.     Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to 1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and 890,000 in 1985/86, the report said.     Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to come on stream in early 1988.     China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while the U.S. Provides the rest, it said.     \"This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are willing to pay a premium for them,\" it said.     Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both 1986/87 and 1987/88.     \"Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient supply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems,\" the report said.  \n',25

'Japanese crushers have bought some 214,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans for late April/early July shipment and may buy up to 140,000 to 190,000 tonnes more for June to August shipment, trade sources said.     Japan imported 128,089 tonnes of Brazilian beans in calendar 1986, Finance Ministry customs-cleared statistics show.     The sources said Brazilian beans were cheaper than U.S. Origin which may account for the heavy purchases, but added there were concerns about deliveries from Brazil in the near term due to labour problems there.     The Japanese purchases comprise 30,000 tonnes for April 20/May 10 shipment, 102,000 for May, 15,000 for late May/early June, 36,000 for June, and 31,000 for late June/early July shipment, the sources said.     As a result of the large volumes of Brazilian beans purchased, Japanese crushers will buy a total of only 150,000 tonnes of U.S. Beans for May shipment. Some 100,000 of this shipment has already been purchased, the sources added.     They said crushers bought some 270,000 to 280,000 tonnes of U.S. Beans for April shipment.  \n',25
'Japanese importers bought some 95,000 tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September shipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources said.     The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs from the premium for the November to April shipment, but down from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment.     Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices in Chicago plus the FOB premium.     Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986 crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some 300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.     Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the sources said.     In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers, but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.  \n',25
'Japanese crushers, starting to buy U.S. Soybeans for April shipment, have recently made purchases of some 48,000 tonnes, trade sources said.

They had predicted earlier that crushers\' April shipment U.S. Bean purchases would drop to 260,000 to 270,000 from the monthly average of 300,000 to 330,000 tonnes due to low soybean meal prices.  \n',25
'Japanese crushers are likely to buy at least 200,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans this year and another 100,000 to 200,000 if quality and shipping conditions are good against 128,089 tonnes in 1986, trade sources said.     A Japanese trading house recently bought about 31,000 tonnes of soybeans for April 10/May 10 shipment, they said.     \"Because Brazilian soybean prices are now some 10 cents a bushel cheaper than U.S. Origin due to the bumper harvest, it is highly likely that Japanese crushers will increase their buying volume,\" one source said.

'U.S. soybean lobbyists and congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S. soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs per bushel next year.     \"I don\'t know who in Congress would propose that happening. Politically it would be totally unacceptable,\" an aide to a senior farm-state senator said.     USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan  at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.     \"I\'m convinced that Congress will not go along with this,\" American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said.     Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive.     His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the administration\'s position is in the debate over what should be done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect soybean farmers\' income.     Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices competitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues to maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move would be too costly.     \"There will be alot of other options that will be considered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutz proposal,\" said Bill O\'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.     \"Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean loan,\" O\'Conner said.     Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr basic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to increase soybean\'s competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss) said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of a soybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or 4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said.  \n',25

'Philippine coconut oil exports to Europe would be virtually wiped out if the European Community (EC) implements a new tax on vegetable oils, Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) chairman Jose Romero said.     But he told reporters he did not think the EC would impose the tax because of objections from the U.S.     \"There\'s just so much flak coming from many countries, spearheaded by the United States, whose soybean exports would be adversely affected. This would spark a trade war,\" he said.     The tax, to be imposed from July, would add about 375 dlrs a tonne to vegetable oils entering the EC.     The Philippines exported 43,540 tonnes of coconut oil worth 11.7 mln dlrs to Europe in January, against total exports of 86,959 tonnes worth 23.8 mln. It also exports copra and copra meal.

'The Agriculture Department must make a decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loan or more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to the government and foreign soybean production will increase, the president of the American Soybean Association, ASA, said.     \"The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another ... USDA can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) as much as they want, but they have to eventually address this problem,\" David Haggard, ASA president, tolds.     USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options, and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on the soybean loan, Haggard said.     \"I don\'t know if USDA is really very serious about addressing the soybean loan problem,\" he said.     At ASA\'s annual winter board of directors meeting here, ASA leaders refused to change their official position on the  loan -- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs.     The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., which call for either a 5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment.     Haggard said he does not know what chances the ASA-backed proposals have but said, \"in all honesty, we do not want to see the farm bill be torn apart.\"     He said if USDA feels it cannot withdraw its opposition to a market loan, there are still numerous ways the USDA could change the loan without new legislation.     Making the loan partially in certificates which would not have to be paid back would be one option, he said.  \n',25

The shipment, priced at 210.34 U.S. Dlrs per tonne c and f Taiwan, is set for delivery between March 20 and April 5, he said.     Taiwan\'s soybeans imports in calendar 1987 are targetted at 1.81 mln tonnes, against an actual 1.74 mln tonnes imported in 1986, he said.     All the imports come from the U.S., He added.  \n',25
'The joint committee of Taiwan\'s soybean importers will tender March 12 for a 27,000 tonne cargo of U.S. Soybeans for March 20 to April 5 delivery, a committee spokesman tolds.

'American soybean producers are confident the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable oils and fats will be rejected but are leaving nothing to chance, American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne Bennett said.     Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean producer delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, was speaking at a lunch.     After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this morning, he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would vote against the proposal, as had a number of other countries.     \"Our information suggests we will have the required number of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward,\" he said.     \"The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20 years, and dropped every time. What we want now is to kill it once and for all,\" Bennett added.     Backing up the soybean producers\' active lobbying, the U.S. Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through, he said.     The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fight the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.     U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for one-fifth of annual production, and are worth about 2.5 billion dlrs a year, Bennett said.     The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U.S. Producers badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of soyoil in the EC, which would suffer far worse than other higher-priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax, he added.     The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to finance the EC\'s own oilseed subsidy machine, he said.     \"We in the ASA are dedicated free-traders. We helped defeat the Wine Equity Act two years ago, but we will not stand by and watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC measures,\" Bennett said.     \"The mood in the U.S. Is turning increasingly protectionist, and the EC\'s actions are fueling the chances of a trade war,\" he added.  \n',25
'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said a marketing loan for soybeans would serve no present purpose because the U.S. price is not above the world price.     Asked in an interview if it was time to consider a marketing loan for soybeans, Lyng said, \"I don\'t think so. I don\'t think the world price is lower than our price anyway.\"     However, the USDA secretary said that if current conditions of surplus production persisted, it might be appropriate to consider a marketing loan.     \"I suppose that under that condition there is a danger our exports will continue to drop and that the government will continue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans,\" he said. \"It might be (worth contemplating a marketing loan), if there were a world market that was lower than our market.\"  \n',25
'Soybeans produced in the United States face a competitive price problem because of the loan rate provisions of the 1985 farm bill, U.S. Undersecretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said.     Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a \"squeeze\" because the Farm Bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rates while limiting the soybean reduction.     As a result, he said U.S.-produced soybeans \"have a price problem\" in competing with other soybean producing countries.     Amstutz called the situation a \"dilemma\" for the USDA, and said \"we have spent hours in ASCS (Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service) looking at this.\"     He did not say what may be done to rectify the situation.  \n',25
'Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.     Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agriculture\'s annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.     \"Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils,\" Balletto said.     Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln tonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.     He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance at 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.     Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said, disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.     \"If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the crush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop,\" he said.     \"This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds,\" Balletto said.     Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies, he said.     World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes, compared with 25.4 mln last year.     The increase should result from lower disappearance, as production is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7 mln last year, he said.     World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln tonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said, while production of other oilseeds was lower.     Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States, he said.     Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S. stocks make up most of those, Balletto said.     The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes, about half of the world soybean surplus, he said.     Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased 13.1 mln tonnes.     \"During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1 mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the U.S. loan program.\"     \"Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long as the U.S. soybean surplus continues.     For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the U.S. loan program.     \"Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the U.S. loan rate.\"     The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said.  \n',25

'Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. ABNN.AS chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank\'s 10.3 pct increase in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar.     Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release of ABN\'s 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance, notably in the securities business.     He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10 share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank\'s stock.     News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN\'s share price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.     Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and ABN\'s share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.     Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986 by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1 pct to 242 mln guilders, he added.     Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings margins via traditional lending activities, he said.     Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank stocks recently.     He said that of the bank\'s estimated 25 financially troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said.     He added that losses incurred through loans to tin producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had been written off.  \n',26
'The Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd ADSA.S (Adsteam) said its one-for-five rights issue at 11.50 dlrs a share will raise 228.5 mln dlrs for general working capital and investment, both in Australia and overseas.     The group announced the issue with its first half earnings and said in a statement that the rights issue will be followed by a one-for-four bonus issue.     Adsteam\'s equity-accounted net earnings rose to 75.05 mln dlrs in the half ended December 31 from 55.68 mln a year earlier and interim dividend to 18 cents from 16.     Adsteam shares eased to 14.20 dlrs from an opening 14.60 and yesterday\'s close of 14.50 on the issue announcement.     The issue will be underwritten by Morgan Grenfell Australia Ltd and McCaughan Dyson Ltd apart from the shares to be taken up by Adsteam\'s associate and largest shareholder, department store retailer David Jones Ltd.     New shares will not rank for the interim dividend but will rank equally thereafter.     Adsteam said it expects to maintain an annual dividend rate of 36 cents on capital enlarged to about 149 mln shares by both issues from 99.36 mln.     Adsteam said its diverse industrial interests generally performed well and its results, as the ultimate holding company and beneficiary, reflected this solid performance.     David Jones, owned 49.2 pct by Adsteam, earned the largest associates\' net of 57.38 mln dlrs in the half against 40.29 mln a year earlier, Adsteam\'s figures show.     Wholly-owned and joint venture companies also did well apart from timber, building supplies and real estate, which returned below-budget profits due to the housing downturn.     Adsteam said it sees 1987/88 as a year of reconstruction and consolidation with the capital base boosted by the issue.  \n',26

'Italy\'s national airline, Alitalia Spa AZPI.MI, reporting a 14.6 pct rise in provisional 1986 net profit, said it carried seven pct more passengers on domestic routes last year, but 11.5 pct fewer passengers on flights from North America and Canada.     Alitalia said the drop in North American traffic had been due to a general fall in the numbers of American tourists visiting Europe caused by fears of terrorism.     The airline reported provisional net profit rose to 55 billion lire from 48 billion in 1985.     A spokesman said Alitalia was hoping for an increase in traffic with the U.S. In 1987.     It planned to increase the number of flights from Italy to New York to 19 per week, to reinstate flights to Boston and to re-open the direct Rome-Milan-Los Angeles service.     The spokesman announced that from March 29, Alitalia would be starting a new weekly service to Shanghai.     For its summer 1987 programme, it would be adding 127 extra flights to European destinations -- an increase of 27 pct.  \n',26
'Allied-Lyons PLC sees rising profits from 51-pct-owned liquor producer Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts in the current fiscal year ending in early March, 1988, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in a speech prepared for delivery to Toronto analysts.     \"We anticipate that Hiram Walker profits will be well above those of the plateau years,\" he said, referring to the four years up to 1985.     \"In other words, we will have regained the 1985 position and improved on it,\" Holden-Brown said.     Allied-Lyons won control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham last year in a battle against Gulf Canada Corp, which finally got a 49 pct stake after an out-of-court settlement.     Hiram Walker Resources Ltd, the previous owner, reported liquor profits of 282 mln Canadian dlrs in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1985, 278 mln dlrs in 1984, 267 mln in 1983, 294 mln in 1982 and 280 mln in 1981.     Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons\' financial results for the fiscal year just ended March seven would include three months of Hiram Walker-Gooderham profits, but he did not provide actual figures.     He said Hiram Walker-Gooderham\'s profit improvement in the current year will come from a previously announced reorganization put into effect March 1, 1987 and a close partnership with Allied-Lyons\' existing Allied Vintners division.  \n',26
'Allied-Lyons PLC will report substantial growth in the second half of fiscal 1987 ended March 7, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in answer to reporters\' queries.     \"You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyons in the second half,\" Holden-Brown said following a presentation to Toronto securities analysts.     Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year.     Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs associated with Elders IXL Ltd\'s failed take-over bid for the company, Holden-Brown also said.     But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons\' sale of its 24.9 pct interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said.     \"So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But hopefully you win them all in the end,\" Holden-Brown said.     Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other take-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: \"No, I don\'t.\"     \"We must never be complacent and we must always be very watchful, but I think we would be very expensive,\" he said.     Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons\' share price to corporate earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies in the food and beverage industry.     \"That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had come a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I think,\" Holden-Brown said.     Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons\' move to acquire Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders take-over bid for the company was \"100 pct a growth action.\"     \"We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and that people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was) defensive, but it never was,\" Holden-Brown told reporters.     Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram Walker, Holden-Brown responded: \"Plan might be too strong a word. But I must say I do feel the need for Allied-Lyons to be better known in Canada.\"  \n',26
'Schweizerische Aluminium AG, Alusuisse, plans to reduce share and participation certificate capital by 50 pct to cover losses in 1986 and those carried forward from the previous year, chief executive Hans Jucker said.     Jucker told a news conference that the greatest drain on its financial resources had been stopped, but after extraordinary charges the net loss of 688 mln francs in 1986 was only slightly under the 756 mln loss of the previous year.     The losses in 1986 and those carried over from 1985 made it necessary to reduce capital by 50 pct, he said.     However, Jucker said the company improved liquidity through a recovery in cash flow and conversion of 300 mln Swiss francs of credit into a subordinated loan.     Trading in Alusuisse shares was suspended on the Zurich stock exchange after today\'s announcement by the company that it would cut its share capital by 50 pct, the bourse said. Trading would resume again on Monday.  \n',26
'Schweizerische Aluminimum AG ALUZ.Z (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said.     \"The threshold of profitability has returned to the foreseeable future,\" he said. \"We expect already in 1987 approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that our industrial environment does not worsen.\"     He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past losses.     Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986 after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985.     Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion.     Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for 1985.     But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news conference the new management installed a year ago had decided to restate the previous five years\' accounts to eliminate rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an asset.     Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from 472 mln in 1985.     It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining, after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in 1985.     Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from 1985, had wiped out the company\'s remaining reserves and exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a 50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22.     Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this \"radical elimination of the mortgages of the past\" painful, but said the foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy.     Haerri said despite the losses, the company\'s liquidity was strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56 billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion.     Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111 mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct in 1985.     In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland SBGZ.Z, Swiss Bank Corp SBVZ.Z and Credit Suisse CRSZ.Z, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan.     The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987.     Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts.     That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169 mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a 479 mln loss instead of 179 mln.     The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders\' equity of 1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar alternations were made for previous years.     After 1986 losses, shareholder\'s equity stood at only 895 mln francs.  \n',26

'The recent deterioration in the steel market makes it important for Arbed SA ARBB.BR to maintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in a statement.     It reported that its competitive position had weakened considerably in the second half of 1986, leading to a seven pct cut in steel output over the whole of the year to 3.74 mln tonnes.     Arbed had managed to make a 890 mln franc net profit, slightly down from the 1.12 billion profit in 1985, thanks to lower raw material costs and prudent management, the company said.     Arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the market deteriorate further, but the decision of the European Community to maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally, should under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect.     EC ministers have agreed to extend a quota production system while discussions continue on an industry plan for capacity reductions.     Arbed said in current conditions, cost cutting efforts remain necessary to avoid any weakening of resources which have been built up over the last three years.  \n',26
'Woolworths Ltd WLWA.S said policy, management and financial changes initiated during the 1986/87 business year should cause profits to reach more acceptable levels in 1987/88 end-February 1.

Results for the first month of the new year were encouraging after a period of uncertain consumer confidence and difficult trading conditions, it said in a statement.

It said pretax profit should rise to 23.0 mln stg in the year to April 2, 1987 from 19.6 mln previously, and reach 27.5 mln in 1987/88. It expects share earnings to rise to 46.9p from 38.7p and to 51.2p in 1987/88, and the 1986/87 dividend to be 17.0p net, a 41.6 pct increase.

'British Columbia Resources Investment Corp, earlier reporting higher full year operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a four year term.     The company said the credit facility is extendable under certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals and completion of formal documentation.     It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs.     B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2 preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain suspended.     However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company\'s trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.     Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred shareholders, with payment expected in early April to shareholders of record March 31, the company said.     If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co WTC, B.C. Resources said.     The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia.     B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and gas interests by 67 pct owned Westar Mining Ltd.     B.C. Resources\' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the sales of Westar Timber\'s Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the company said.     The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C. Resources\' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and exposure to the fluctuating pulp market.     It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs.  \n',26
'Babcock International Plc BABK.L said in a statement accompanying final results for 1986, showing pretax profits up to 37.09 mln stg from 34.55 mln in 1985, that overall further progress is expected in 1987.     The predicted slowdown of the U.S. Automobile industry is affecting the North American group although the improved performance in the FATA European group during 1986 is expected to continue into this year.

The bank said the estimate could rise to between 1.30 dlrs and 1.80 dlrs a share if the full pension surplus is obtained. It said it did not know when distributions would be made.

'BASF AG BASF.F said net profit of its U.S. Operating company, BASF Corp, rose last calendar year to 105 mln dlrs from 39 mln in 1985.     Turnover rose by by more than one billion dlrs to 3.6 billion, the parent company said in a statement. The rise, however, partly reflected the inclusion of the first full business year of three acquisitions made in 1985. Excluding these, BASF Corp turnover rose four pct from 1985.     Acquisitions were the high-performance connecting materials operations of Celanese Corp, Inmont Corp bought from United Technologies and American Enka bought from AKZO NV AKZO.AS.     BASF said it expected a U.S. Investment of 240 mln dlrs in 1987, part of a five-year programme totalling one billion.     U.S. Projects completed in 1986 included the second acrylic acid plant in Freeport, Texas, a technical centre in Southfield, Michigan, in which paint lines from automotive plants can be refitted, and the new agricultural research centre in Research Triangle Park in Durham, North Carolina.     BASF said that work this year had begun in Geismar, Louisiana, on plants for production of special amines and polytetrahydrofuran, as well as for expansion of capacity for producing tetrahydrofuran.  \n',26
'A strong performance from all BAT Industries Plc\'s BTI.L major sectors enabled the group\'s 1986 pretax profits to pass the one billion stg level for the third year running, Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement.     The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39 billion, which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.     Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth Avenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper.     Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a four pct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume.     The results were largely in line with analysts expectations and BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT.     BAT said the U.S. Brown and Williamson unit held most of its 1985 gains and increased profit 18 pct in dollar terms.     Financial services saw profits double to 282 mln with both Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth.     Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual premiums to 39 mln stg. BAT said it increased new business by 38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first quarter. Its permanent health insurance was now the market leader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in the U.K.     Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1.03 billion. Its life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting results in the second half.     Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio dropped to 41 pct from 51 pct. The net ratio, at 26 pct, left the group strongly placed to pursue its further development.     Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg, nearly three times the 1982 level, with Wiggins Teape\'s sales rising 36 pct to pass one billion stg.     BAT said in 1986 it had sold 88 BATUS stores in the U.S. For 644 mln dlrs and sold Grovewood Securities for 142 mln stg.  \n',26
'BAT Industries Plc BTI.L 1986 results, which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed the company was in a strong position and that its shares were probably undervalued, share analysts said.     BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading after a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538p earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39 billion pre-tax.     Stock market analysts said today\'s generally weak stock market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the share price.     \"In the current market, people almost expect companies to beat expectations,\" said one analyst, adding that pretax profits of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.     BAT\'s 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985 pretax profit of 1.17 billion.     Brokers noted that BAT\'s shift away from its underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.     BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74 pct four years ago.     Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company declining further as other sectors increased in importance.     He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial services, in particular in the U.S.     Sheehy also said the group had \"no sizeable acquisitions\" in sight in the near future.     Analysts said BAT\'s increasingly good performance in the U.K. Insurance area was encouraging.     Its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16 pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to make major acquisitions, they said.  \n',26
'Chemicals group Bayer AG BAYG.F said it expects to post another good result in 1987 after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986.     The company said that this was despite the mark\'s further strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and despite an increase in competitive pressure.     \"The further progress of our business will depend largely on the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy costs.     Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year\'s record of 3.15 billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72 billion from 1.62 billion.     The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985 results, up one mark from a year earlier.     Bayer said that world group operating profit declined slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed a further improvement.     Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to 40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark.     Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought pressure on selling prices, it added.     In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against 1985, the company said without giving details.     \"The western Europe, North America and Far East regions developed well in local currency, but here too the translation of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture, especially in the case of North America,\" it said.     Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in 1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks.     Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986, resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset falling prices and cost increases in other areas.     The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income. Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw materials all developed well, it said.     Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period.     Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower.     Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarter against 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985.  \n',26
'Bayerische Vereinsbank AG BVMG.F expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987 earnings but profits will only barely reach last year\'s record levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said.     He told the annual news conference that possible credit risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.     Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from 222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.     Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased slightly and stood around 0.7 pct.     Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.     Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.     The parent bank\'s 1986 partial operating profit, which excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed two pct to 671 mln marks.     The parent bank\'s balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5 billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.     It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.     The mortgage sector\'s share in total parent bank business volume rose to 46 pct from 45.     Hackl said that in January and February this year, the bank\'s credit business had not livened up. But despite the sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.  \n',26
'Berliner Bank AG has suffered losses of between 25 mln and 30 mln marks on credits extended by its Stuttgart branch by bank officials who exceeded their powers, a bank spokesman said.

'Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG BKFG.F, BfG, partial operating profits fell to 182.6 mln marks in 1986 from 313.7 mln in 1985, new majority shareholder Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG AMVG.F, AMB, said.     But total operating and extraordinary profits, including earnings from currency and securities trading on the bank\'s own account and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms, were more than double the previous year\'s level, AMB said.     BfG\'s 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB\'s capital increase, which is to finance the insurance company\'s acquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG.     Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid an unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company, Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG, from which AMB has acquired the majority stake.     The bank has said its business last year suffered from the turbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housing concern Neue Heimat.     AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG\'s business volume to 50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus.     The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from 981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in the interest margin to 1.9 pct.     A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from 188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.     The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up risk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasised because of the continuing difficulties of some countries.     Disclosed risk provisions, which under West German accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount, rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.     BfG\'s parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in 1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct of this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for 14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.     BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01 pct of Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG, 74.9 pct of BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG and five pct of Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG. The sale was linked to AMB\'s acquisition of a majority of BfG.     These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transfer agreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions.  \n',26

'Australia\'s largest company, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd BRKN.S (BHP), is expected to report a net profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first nine months ended February 28, share analysts polled bys said.     This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the first three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31 1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.     The analysts estimated that the group would report a third quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.     BHP\'s earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted to 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.     The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait fields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and steel earnings.     They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been affected by industrial and production problems.     The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP\'s lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors, and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around 300 mln dlrs.     One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on capital expenditure in the steel division, they said.     They said they saw BHP\'s full year earnings at around 900 mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from 1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it would be difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit.  \n',26
'The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd BRKN.S said it expects a strong full year result, helped by sigificant investment allowance credits in the fourth quarter, but net will fall short of the record 988.2 mln dlrs earned in 1985/86 ended May 31.     The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to 603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28 from 813.0 mln a year earlier.     Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November 31, BHP said in a statement.     Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of share analysts\' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs.     BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1.     The bonus is being made from reserves which will not qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of dividend imputation next July 1.     The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP said.     BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of dividend will be maintained on the increased capital.     The level of future dividends will be influenced by the implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation, it said.     As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in shareholders\' hands provided they are paid out of profits that have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate.     BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln a year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln.     BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new plant and some operational difficulties.     The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.     The 60.7 mln dlr extraordinary gain, all in the third term, reflected a 240.7 mln profit on the sale of Blue Circle Southern Cement Ltd offset by a U.S. Oil acreage writedown.  \n',26

'Swedish mining and metals group Boliden AB BLDS ST forecast a return to profitability during 1987 after recording a 1.08 billion crown 1986 loss burdened by a massive write-off.     The company, which consolidated the Swedish wholesale and investment conglomerate Ahlsell AB this year, said the result included restructuring costs and write-offs of 802 mln crowns.     \"These costs have arisen as a results of a change of direction for the group. They are mainly one-off but they have burdened the annual accounts,\" the company said in a statement.     Boliden said the company\'s liquid assets were 1.36 billion crowns at year-end which together with an investment portfolio of 1.60 billion made it one of the most liquid Swedish companies.     As a result of the 1986 losses, the board proposed cancelling dividend for the year although it predicted a return to profitability during 1987, the statement added.

'The British Petroleum Co of Australia Ltd reported a 16.15 mln dlr net loss for 1986 against a 73.38 mln dlr profit in 1985 after sales fell to 2.27 billion dlrs from 2.94 billion.     The British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L unit attributed the deficit to stock losses arising from the drop in crude prices in the first half, when it made a 119.93 mln dlr loss.     It said government compensation, in the form of subsidies to refiners to partially cover stock losses, together with improved crude prices in the second half, enabled the group\'s oil business to make a modest pre-tax profit.     BP Australia said it had not recommended a dividend.     Commenting on the year\'s performance, the company said it suspended operations at the 60 pct-owned Agnew Nickel mine because of losses sustained from declining nickel prices.     The results also included an 11.3 mln dlr extraordinary writedown on the value of the laid-up oil exploration drillship Regional Endeavour.     BP Australia said it had sold its 33-1/3 stake in chemical maker CSBP and Farmers Ltd yielding an extraordinary profit of 18.9 mln dlrs and expected to finalise the sale of the 80 pct-owned Kwinana Nitrogen Co in the first half of 1987.  \n',26

Chief executive David Kendall said improved results mirrored benefits of a restructuring program undertaken in recent years.

'British Caledonian Group, Britain\'s second largest airline, has announced a 19.3 mln stg pretax loss for the financial year ending last October, compared with a record pre-tax profit of 21.7 mln stg in 1985, chairman Sir Adam Thomson told reporters.     A decline in U.S. Transatlantic traffic following terrorist attacks in Europe, the U.S. Bombing of the Libya, the Chernobyl disaster and a slump in the oil industry which affected Middle East traffic were the main causes of the loss, Thomson said.     He said the poor results were caused by \"a range of exceptional circumstances wholly outside our direct control\" and predicted a return to profitability this year.     Last year, the airline was forced to axe 1,000 jobs, sell some of its assets and cut the number of its flights across the Atlantic and to the Middle East following the fall in business .  \n',26

'British Telecommunications Plc\'s BTY.L profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old telephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said.     Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results which were released earlier today, Odgers said the company faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems in Britain for three to five years.     He said Mercury Communications Ltd, a Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor.     Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some of British Telecom\'s most profitable areas.     One company official privately estimated that British Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct.     The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, which lead to some disruption in service, could well have encouraged clients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said.     However, he forecast that the last quarter\'s results overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout.     He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at 50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities.     But on balance Odgers said that group\'s financial strength, economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth industry will help produce annual profit increases for the forseeable future.     British Telecom will also seek to expand into manufacturing, he said, adding that research and development expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover.     Analysts said the company\'s downbeat forecasts helped shares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday\'s close and off an early high of 248p.     Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd said the market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a seven to eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profit over the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-tax profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion.     Augar noted that a government-imposed formula linking charges to inflation meant that the company\'s scope for raising prices was limited as long as inflation remains low.  \n',26

'Caesars World Inc CAW said its directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain their common stock ownership in Caesars World.     Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800 mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired.     Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars\' financial advisor, has told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire financing needed for the recapitalization.     Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the board believes the recapitalization plan is financially superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff.     Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer.     The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday.     \"Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible primarily because of the financial stability and the strong operating results achieved by management in recent years,\" Gluck said.     He said that after the recapitalization takes effect, proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs.     Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be 76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization common and common-equivalent shares outstanding.     Commenting on the company\'s longer term earnings outlook, Gluck said \"we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization.\"     He said the company does not usually release projections, but has done so now beause of the significance of the recapitalization.     Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June.     The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities.     As part of the plan, the company will change its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.     The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide for, among other things, a \"fair price\" provision requiring that certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares held by such interested stockholders.     Caesars World said in a statement that \"the cash distribution will result in a substantial deficit in stockholders\' equity.\" It did not give an estimate of the size of this deficit.     But the company said its financial advisors have said they believe that after the recapitalization, Caesars World should have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to finance its current and projected operating and capital requirements.  \n',26
'Canada\'s major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing if, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said.     American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing.     Such action \"would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian banks to do the same,\" Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank analyst Donna Pulcine tolds.     \"They (banks) like to appear to be conservative,\" said Pulcine, \"and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing basis and the Canadian banks don\'t, there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non-performing and another bank is not.\"     Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp CCI to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks.     \"In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) have to have the support of the other banks,\" said Meredith.     Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd said at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify, \"wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position.\"     Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs by Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.     Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days. They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until late May, which falls in Canadian banks\' third quarter ending July 31.     Bank of Montreal, Brazil\'s largest Canadian bank creditor, said last week it was not currently considering declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as non-performing.     \"I think that is just for the benefit of the public,\" Walsh said of Bank of Montreal\'s statement.      Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans non-performing.     They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks\' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income.     \"From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks will get the money,\" said Meredith. \"My outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year\'s earnings.\"     Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of 3.80 dlrs for Royal Bank of Canada compared with 3.74 in 1986; 4.30 dlrs for Bank of Montreal compared with 3.59; 2.25 dlrs for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce compared with 2.23;  2.15 dlrs for Bank of Nova Scotia compared with 1.94, and 2.85 dlrs for Toronto Dominion Bank against 2.74.     She forecast 1.90 dlrs for National Bank of Canada against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split.     Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share, assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil\'s interest costs.     \"If the banks didn\'t receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a share. But I don\'t see that as a likely scenario,\" Pulcine said.     Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the Brazilian debt situation was so complex that \"it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year.\"     He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil\'s yearly interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings.  \n',26
'Canada\'s airline industry, shaken up by a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said.     \"Now we\'ve got a company that can compete with Air Canada,\" said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. \"Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market.\"     The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week as Canadian Airlines International Ltd.     Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the 6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada\'s 50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine pct.     Analysts believe Pacific Western\'s aggressive and cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd.     They said CP Air\'s management style had been not much different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because neither airline was held accountable to its owners.     \"Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line,\" said Bradley.     \"But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air Canada is on the verge of going that way,\" he said.     CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than profits, was \"a perennial money-loser,\" analyst Wilfred Hahn of Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report.     Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.     Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more than 2 billion dlrs.     Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more attention to finances, analysts said.     It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit \"in excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs\" for 1986. However, this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.     Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year, attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.     For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from cost-cutting and careful spending.     Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain.     \"The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody else\'s,\" Friend said.     Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline shares for at least a year.     Analysts said Air Canada\'s immediate concern ahead of a public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes without setting off a political storm.     It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.     Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later, already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of a dozen aircraft from Europe\'s Airbus Industrie.     Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the Boeing Co.     Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet, needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without hurting profits.     Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian Airlines\' profit in 1988 will more than double last year\'s 29.8 mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western.  \n',26
'Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter ended January 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than last year\'s 697.0 mln dlrs.     However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of provisioning for loan losses established last year because of many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31.     The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5 mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.     Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in calculating first quarter results.     The bank\'s first quarter provision for loan losses rose to 172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.     Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal government\'s Inspector General of Banks.     First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs.     Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to 213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions, non-interest expenses and income taxes.     The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92 billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.     Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100 dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986, but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.     The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4 billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from fiscal 1986 year-end.     \"Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank\'s loans to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987, and there was little adverse impact on the bank\'s earnings prior to the announcement,\" Commerce bank said.     The bank did not disclose a forecast of the impact on future earnings by Brazil\'s suspension of interest payments.  \n',26
'Canadian Pacific Ltd said fourth quarter 1986 operating profit rose to 91.6 mln dlrs, or 30 cts a share, from 50.7 mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, a year ago.     The statement confirmed released preliminary earnings figures the company released in February.     A 102.6 mln dlr gain on the sale of CP\'s Cominco Ltd interest helped raise final 1986 fourth quarter profit to 193.8 mln dlrs or 65 cts a share.     The company said a drop in 1986 full-year operating profit to 150.1 mln dlrs from a restated 252.7 mln dlrs in 1985 was due mainly to lower world oil prices.     The company said its CP Rail division reported 1986 net income of 119.4 mln dlrs, compared with 133.4 mln dlrs in 1985. It said grain traffic recovered from drought-affected levels of a year ago but was offset by weakness in other traffic areas and increased expenses.     It said the net loss from its Soo Line increased to 33.5 mln dlrs loss from 8.7 mln dlrs loss in 1985, mainly due to restructuring charges.     Canadian Pacific said favorable developments during the year included reduced bulk shipping losses as a result of a recovery in tanker markets and a turnaround in the forest products sector.  \n',26

'Carolian Systems International Inc said it anticipates profit for fiscal 1987 ending June 30 will be lower than fiscal 1986 earnings of 410,000 dlrs, despite an expected revenue increase of 37 pct to more than 3.5 mln dlrs.     After an extraordinary expense associated with the December, 1986 withdrawal of a planned common share offering, \"we expect to be modestly profitable for the year, but below the 410,000 dlrs earned in fiscal 1986,\" the company said.     Carolian previously reported fiscal six month profit of 12,933 dlrs, excluding an extraordinary loss of 17,210 dlrs, compared to earnings of 69,829 dlrs in the prior year.     The company said it anticipated fiscal 1987 earnings to be lower due to withdrawal of its share offering, computer equipment shipment delays and costs associated with sales staff expansion.

'Buoyed by low fuel prices and favourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd\'s CAPH.HK 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline\'s forecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said.     Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings of between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports results tomorrow for its first year as a public company.     Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd SWPC.HK, made its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in May last year.     Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making a total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the prospectus, analysts polled bys said.     They said the airline\'s performance improved in the second half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln dlrs.     The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one U.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company\'s favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time of the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said.     James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline industry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the 1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would affect Cathay\'s net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits of 1.25 billion dlrs.      Analysts said the company\'s estimates of fuel price and currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative.     \"This is reflected in their interim results which showed that profit margin has increased,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.     Cathay\'s six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier levels, but profits rose 69 pct.     The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on the company\'s fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices usually lag behind crude price movements by several months, analysts said.     By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and sterling 12 pct.     \"Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against Cathay\'s major trading currencies helped push passenger yields in the first half up 7.2 pct,\" said James Capel. \"This should continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to end the year up 7.6 pct.\"     A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash under management also improved profits, James Capel said.     A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed to Cathay\'s revenue increase, but the company\'s load factor declined because of increased competition and an expansion of its fleet and services.     James Capel estimated Cathay\'s passenger-kilometres flown last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown climbed 17 pct, though the airline\'s load factor probably fell to 68.8 pct from 70 pct.     \"Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,\" said Tsang. \"This affected its load factor.\"     Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier Hong Kong Dragon Airways Ltd may have contributed to Cathay\'s decision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analysts said.  \n',26
'Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd CAPH.HK forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over the year-earlier period.     The airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987 but said it would take delivery of one Boeing Co BA.N 747 freighter and one Boeing 747-300 passenger plane in September and November respectively after it took a 747-300 last month.     It earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 1.23 billion H.K. Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14 cents a share.     But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance charges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year.     A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraft deliveries in 1986.     However, the company said in a statement good returns from funds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher interest costs resulting from additional lease financing and other borrowing.     It added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuel prices fall to an average 4.59 dlrs a gallon from 6.76 dlrs in 1985.     Passengers carried by Cathay Pacific totalled 4.2 mln last year, up from 3.85 in 1985, with the passengers kilometre travelled rising to 14.02 billion from 12.56 billion.

Charan reported profit of 3.0 mln dlrs in 1985.     Takefman said he expects sales to rise to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 57.3 mln dlrs in 1986.     Fiscal 1985 ended September 30, while fiscal 1986 ended November 30.     Takefman said the company is actively looking for acquisitions in the consumer products industry, likely in Canada.     The company said it expects to resolve delivery problems this year which last year hindered the growth of its toy distribution business, which accounts for about one-third of revenues.     Charan is the exclusive distributor in Canada for Worlds of Wonder toys, which include the Teddy Ruxpin voice-activated talking plush bear.     Takefman said new products this year, which will be on the shelves for Christmas, include a smaller version of Teddy Ruxpin, a talking Mickey Mouse toy, dancing plush toys, a doll with a voice activated by sound, touch, light and heat, and talking books.     The company is also marketing an extended line of \"laser tag\" kits, which shoot rays of light and tell you when you\'ve hit someone.     Other products include a recorder device which allows students to leave taped messages in each others\' school lockers, retailing for about 60 dlrs.  \n',26
'State-owned Chemie Linz AG is likely to record a 1986 loss of some 600 mln schillings compared with a 340 mln loss in 1985, a company spokesman said.     Falling sales and lower world prices of fertilisers were largely responsible for the sharp increase, along with the effects of the dollar\'s fall which has helped to give U.S. Fibre producers a competitive edge, he tolds.     The firm would have made a small profit in 1985 had it not been for 456 mln schillings lost by subsidiary Merx HandelsgesmbH on oil trading. Merx has since withdrawn from the oil market. The firm will announce 1986 results in July.  \n',26
'Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd CKGH.HK is expecting strong results this year after reporting better than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said.     He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19 cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a four-for-one stock split.     The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15 cents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus issue.     Cheung Kong\'s earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in 1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985.     Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gains of 983.6 mln dlrs mainly from the firm\'s sale of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd HKEH.HK for one billion dlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985.     Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local property market and substantial increases in contributions from associated companies.     \"Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for the property market,\" Li said. \"The growth in (Hong Kong\'s) exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial buildings.\"     Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in the British colony, Li said, noting the firm is interested in a land reclamation project along the Hong Kong harbour and is exchanging views with the government on a proposal to build a second airport.  \n',26
'China\'s first joint venture bank, Xiamen International Bank (XIB), reported a group net profit of about 14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the bank\'s first full year of operation.     General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit forecast, saying targets were under study.     Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group\'s outstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs, up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowings rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he tolds.     Liu said most of the group\'s profit came from the parent company rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries Xiamen International Finance Co Ltd in Hong Kong and Luso International Bank Ltd in Macao.     The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985 but did not officially open until March 1986.     Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign partner, Hong Kong-listed Panin Holdings Ltd, had been cut last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign banks felt the XIB\'s reputation would be improved if the three Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.     Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were unfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a loss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of 268,000 dlrs in 1985.     The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15, Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10).     One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on unequal terms with state-owned banks.     The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost saturated, he added.     Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted from contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank.     Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International Agricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the state-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eight foreign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of Hong Kong or overseas Chinese banks.  \n',26

'Automobiles Citroen expects rising sales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits significantly this year, continuing a financial recovery after six straight years of losses, president Jacques Calvet said.     Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX sports model, he said: \"All the budgetary forecasts that we have been able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement in 1987, compared with 1986,\" he added.     Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA PEUP.PA group, increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct in first two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It is aiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after 11.7 pct in 1986.     The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the European market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from 2.9 pct in 1986.     \"Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the demand,\" Calvet said. \"This is a relatively new problem for us.\"     Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut the deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to modernise its range and improve productivity.     Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen\'s 1986 profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs.     This weekend he said that those profit estimates \"remain about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic.\"     Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the AX, launched on the French market last October. It will be available throughout most of western Europe within four months.     The car has registered just over 20,000 sales.     It is being built at Citroen\'s large plant at Aulnay-sous- Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and Vigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of 1,000 cars a day.     The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model between its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to compete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa.     The AX had built up its market share in France to around four pct last month. Calvet said: \"Our hope is that once the AX is fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent of the national market.\"  \n',26

'Comalco Ltd said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.     It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.     Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final dividend, delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws.     This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985.     Comalco said the aluminium industry continues to suffer from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings.     Comalco\'s Commonwealth Aluminium Corp unit said earlier it has conditionally agreed to sell its Goldendale smelter in Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to Columbia Aluminium Corp. Comalco said its extraordinary provision of 27.3 mln dlrs costs for Goldendale losses and closure may be reduced if the sales agreement were completed.  \n',26

'Commerzbank AG CBKG.F said a dividend of nine marks would be proposed for ordinary shareholders on 1986 earnings after eight in 1985.     It added in a statement that parent net profit rose to 288.2 mln marks in 1986 from 221.7 mln the prior year.     A Commerzbank spokesman noted the figures were,however, preliminary and required approval of the bank\'s supervisory board which meets today.     The Commerzbank statement added the distributable profit last year rose to 228.2 mln marks from 161.7 mln in 1985.     With inclusion of the corporate tax allowance, qualifying domestic shareholders would receive an effective dividend of 14.06 marks per share.     Total dividend payout would rise to 186.8 mln marks from 142.0 mln on 1985 earnings due to the increase in the dividend and in equity capital, it added.     From the parent net profit, 60 mln marks would be placed in published reserves, unchanged from the two prior years.     The shareholders\' meeting take place on May 22 in Hamburg.     The statement said holders of Commerzbank participation certificates in a total nominal value of 425 mln marks would receive the remaining 41.4 mln marks of the distributable profit. Aside from the basic payment of 8.25 pct of nominal value, certificate holders would receive an additional 1.5 pct.     The management board of the bank would also propose two capital measures to shareholders in order to be able to react quickly to new challenges.     It would ask for authorised capital of a nominal 200 mln marks for the issue of new shares and for 300 mln for the issue of warrant bonds, both for the period until April 30, 1992.  \n',26
'Commerzbank AG CBKG.F management board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be lower than in 1986.     In the first two months of the year, partial operating profit -- excluding trading on the bank\'s own account - declined, he said, without giving details.     The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of 1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly. By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased.     German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp said last year the figure for the first time had topped one billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was around 50 pct higher than this.     Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, \"we were able to raise the full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of 1985 because own account profits increased slightly.\"     He gave no concrete details but added that in January and February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure.     The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in future, developing, for example, more into investment banking, keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets.     Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had been a strong growth in business volume.     Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2 billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added.     Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15 billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relationships had remained unchanged.     In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985\'s 2.56 pct despite pressure on credit rates.     The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said.     Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct to more than 650 mln.     As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks.     Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year from 233 mln in 1985.     Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a \"high two-figure million\" in profit from the sale of the bank\'s AEG AG AEGG.F shares to Daimler-Benz AG DAIG.F during the latter\'s majority stake purchase booked last year.     The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior years, to its full extent.     Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further.     Seipp said that because about half the group\'s exposure to problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks.     \"This means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default,\" he added.     Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems.     All banks had significantly strengthened their capital base, most European banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties.     He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new approach to indebted nations\' problems. There was a lot of interest in direct investment via an equity participation in Latin America, particularly from West German firms.  \n',26

'(Consolidated-Bathurst Inc) said it expects improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in the second half of 1986 to continue this year. The continued improvement would be due to good market demand, better product prices and high operating capacity, the company said in its annual report.     Consolidated-Bathurst, which reported operating profit of 104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said its joint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar, B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contribute to equity earnings.     Last year\'s results were up from 1985 operating profit of 80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs.     The company said it views its near-term prospects with improved optimism.     It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in the U.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacity and production and more favorable market conditions.     It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987 for its Diamond-Bathurst Inc (DBH) subsidiary, which lost 6.2 mln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year, and expects higher sales and earnings for its other North American packaging divisions.     Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its Europa Carton unit is mixed. It said the effect of trade disputes between the United States and the European Economic Community on the West German economy and the higher value of the mark may lead to increased costs which could not be offset by price increases.  \n',26
'Continental Illinois Corp\'s CIL Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule Brazil\'s debt payments taking at least three to six months.     Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks are under way.     \"I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer, for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil\'s debt,\" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.     \"I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just how long the run is is anybody\'s guess,\" Swearingen said.     Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil\'s moritorium may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.     The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago, Continental\'s largest subsidiary, said in response to an inquiry.     Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.     Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for 1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses. Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.     In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.     The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC, during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the 1984 restructuring agreement with the government.     The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987, Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.     In 1986 the bank\'s loans to the Midwest\'s middle market rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.     Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it bought three small suburban banks.     Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.     He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who will eventually own the firm because it still holds the equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.     The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984 bailout of the bank.     Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not comment on a successor.     The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country doesn\'t need external sources of cash.  \n',26
'Counsel Corp said it plans a three-for-two stock split, pending shareholder approval at the April 28 annual meeting.     The company said it recently reported 1986 profit of 5.9 mln dlrs, or 1.51 dlrs a share, before extraordinary items, compared with 2.2 mln dlrs, or 81 cts, in 1985.  \n',26
'CRA Ltd CRAA.S said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1, making 13 cents for&#127;the year against 15 in 1985.     The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against analysts\' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to&#127;160 mln.     CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been p&#127;id.     The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.     Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout, it said.     Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of gold producers.     Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.     Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.     World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance, but overcapacity continues, CRA said.     Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd BUVA.S contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd\'s CMAC.S net was 37.8 mln.     Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.     Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985, CRA said.     Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln.     CRA\'s share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.     CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.     Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions, CRA said.     Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.     CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985 mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0 mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost.  \n',26
'Creditanstalt-Bankverein CABV.VI is likely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12 pct of share capital, deputy general-director Guido Schmidt-Chiari said.     The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank\'s share capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986 from 2.7 billion a year earlier.     Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.     Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.     The banking group\'s consolidated balance sheet total rose to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion.     General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last year\'s better profits had resulted from improvements in services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling lending.     Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when compared with those in other countries, he said.     Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits, Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure.     Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations, removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet total.     In an attempt to generate more foreign business, representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and drawing dividends.     Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers said improved results had been widely expected by investors.     Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in 1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of 2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria\'s largest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and large Austrian companies.     But he forecast its biggest industrial subsidiary, Steyr -Daimler-Puch AG SDPV.VI would return a 1987 result similar to the expected 1986 operating loss of 700 mln schillings.  \n',26

'Deutsche Bank AG DBKG.F has seen a slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986, management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said.

The weak German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference.     Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78 billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion.     Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank\'s own account, not included in partial operating profits.     Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest surplus in a section current earnings from securities and participations.     In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from 1.45 billion.     As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits.     But it said that total operating profits, including own account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the parent bank.     Banking analysts said this put group total operating profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank operating profits at over five billion marks.     Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its unchanged 12 mark dividend.     The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986, and developments so far this year showed that was correct, Christians said.     West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits.     The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a high level of risk provision, Christians said.     Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in 1986 from 765 mln in 1985.     Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily reflect the full amount of risk provisions.     Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said Deutsche\'s total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985 because of the fall in the dollar.     He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of such problem country debt had been written off.     Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of \"other securities,\" to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the parent bank.     Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due to its increased activity in international share placements, with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA\'s international placement last year remaining on its books.     Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to place these shares and conclude the original placement.  \n',26

'Dutch food retailer Ahold NV AHLN.AS expects unchanged profits in 1987 but said it will take advantage of the lower dollar to expand further in the U.S.     Turnover will grow but net profits are expected to remain around the 1986 level of 132.4 mln guilders due to higher Dutch taxes and a three-year expansion plan, Ahold Chairman Albert Heijn told a news conference.     The profit forecast allows for a dollar rate around current levels of just over three guilders.     Turnover and net profit in 1986 were hit by the dollar, which fell to an average 2.46 guilders from 3.35 in 1985.  \n',26

'Esso Malaysia Bhd, a unit of Exxon Corp of the U.S., Reported net profit of 70 mln ringgit from its petroleum and ammonia operations in 1986 compared with 48.7 mln in 1985. Chairman Gerald F Cox said the improved performance was mainly due to product prices falling more slowly than crude prices during the year.     He added that total sales volume increased as a result of higher offtake by affiliated companies, while inland market sales were maintained at around the previous year\'s levels.     But growth prospects in 1987 remained weak and 1986 results are unlikely to be repeated in the current financial year.  \n',26
'The combined profits of Japan\'s major corporations, excluding financial institutions, are forecast to fall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31, compared to the 19.9 pct decline projected in late November, Wako Research Institute of Economics said.     The private research body also said in a statement that 437 of the 1,084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the year against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November.     Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct, it said.     Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries to cope with the yen\'s sharp rise are beginning to brighten their business outlook, the institute said.     It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reduce corporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improved performance outlook.     Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction businesses, it said.     The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88.  \n',26
'Media group John Fairfax Ltd FFXA.S said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected the impact of changes in the Australian tax system.     Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to 25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mln a year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30 mln from 44.29 mln.     Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on fringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, the company said in a statement.     Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue growth in the television industry as another reason for the flat first half earnings.     It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of these factors.     Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, as did the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremely satisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly.     But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0 pct rise in revenue, it said.     Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the receipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from Australian Associated Press Pty Ltd (AAP) after the sale of AAP\'s \"B\" shares ins Holdings Plc RTRS.L.     This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit.     Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the full year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr acquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbourne will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.  \n',26
'Fiduciary Trust Co International said its shareholders at the annual meeting approved a five-for-one stock split effective May 15, 1987, to holders of record on April 15, 1987.     The company said the split would increase the number of authorized common shares from 440,000 to 2,200,000 shares issued. In addition, the company said it authorized another 800,000 shares, but would not issue them at this time.

'Fruehauf Corp, which went private in December through a leveraged buyout, said the predecessor company had a 1986 loss of 60.9 mln dlrs compared to earnings of 70.5 mln dlrs in 1985.     Sales of the predecessor company were 2.68 billion dlrs compared to 2.56 billion dlrs in 1985, including the sales by the operations which are divestiture candidates.     Fruehauf said in connection with the buyout acquisition, the predecessor company incurred about 97 mln dlrs in expenses charged against 1986 operations.     In addition to the direct expenses, Fruehauf said operating results were adversely affected by an unquantifiable amount due to the disruption related to a proxy contest and attempted hostile takeover which started in early 1986.     Fruehauf said its board rescheduled the annual meeting to June 18 from May 7 to allow for completion and distribution of the 1986 results to shareholders.  \n',26

'Societe Generale de Belgique BELB.BR said the near doubling of net profits in 1986 was due in large part to the sale of shares in Genstar Corp.

However, it added in a statement that the company made major capital gains on sales during the year, in particular from the sale of Genstar shares.

'West Germany\'s chemical industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987 turnover will stabilize around 1986\'s 140 billion marks, Josef Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said.     Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG BAYG.F, told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as well as crude oil and commodity prices.     Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.     The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.     Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price competition and increased costs.     Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years, neutralized the negative impact.     Strenger said the industry would try to increase production in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of West Germany.     The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and 22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.     Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.     Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late last year.  \n',26

'Gulf States Utilities Co said its condition has \"significantly deteriorated\" and that its operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless it receives additional financing or rate relief from state public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana.     In the company\'s newly-released annual report and 10-K filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the utility last month that no additional credit would be granted. Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs.     \"The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company may have to seek protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy code,\" Gulf States said.     The utility had previously said it might be forced to consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf States\' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.     \"If the regulatory commissions approve the company\'s proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period, the company believes it could achieve financial stability,\" Gulf States said.     In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1 mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas.     Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in emergency rate relief.

'Hillsdown Holdings Plc HLDN.L said early results for 1987 were encouraging, and the combination of its investment and acquisition strategies enabled it to look forward confidently for an excellent result for the year.

'The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp HKBH.HK is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and 13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth, share analysts polled bys said.     Their estimates of the bank\'s net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.     They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue.     Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year, probably one for three or one for five.     The bank\'s 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd HSGH.HK is to report its 1986 results on Friday.     Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to 12 pct.     They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.     Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise, Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.     \"They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand, as their loan portfolio is well balanced,\" an analyst at Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.     Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.     Loans to finance Hong Kong\'s visible trade, the mainstay of the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985.     Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986, but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.     The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.     \"The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks,\" one analyst said.     The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd WAIA.HK and James Capel and Co, analysts said. \"Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter,\" an analyst said.     Wardley was underwriter for last year\'s billion-dlr flotation of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time.     The bank\'s stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake in South China Morning Post Ltd, the larger of two English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.     The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.     Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced need to write off bad debts. \"The need for provisions was much lower than the year before,\" said Tony Measor of Hong Leong Securities Co Ltd. \"Last year\'s profits should have been 2.8 to 2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions.\"     Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.     The bank\'s Latin American exposure, mainly through its 51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc MM, appears to have improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland\'s 1986 fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145 mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.  \n',26
'Hoechst AG HFAG.F said its group pre-tax profit in 1986 would be slightly lower than the 3.16 billion marks posted in 1985, while parent company pre-tax profits rose slightly from the 1.62 billion in 1985.     Group turnover fell slightly to 38 billion marks from 42.72 billion in 1985, and parent company turnover fell to around 14 billion marks from 15.35 billion, the company said in a statement.  \n',26
'Hoechst AG HFAG.F said in a statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.     The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.     World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in 1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01 billion from 42.72 billion.     Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.     The statement made no mention of net profit figures. Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.     In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from 1986, Hoechst said.     Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.     Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to American Hoechst Corp.     Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.     Roussel Uclaf RUCF.PA and most domestic non-consolidated partners did not perform as well as in 1985.     Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in extraordinary costs.     The fall in raw material prices was not enough to compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and currencies, Hoechst said.     The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new projects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the acquisition of Celanese Corp.     Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to form Hoechst Celanese Corp.  \n',26
'Honeywell Bull Inc, owned by Honeywell Inc HON, Cie des Machines Bull and NEC Corp, said it expects its 1987 revenues to increase 15 to 20 pct over its current level of about 1.9 billion dlrs.     Honeywell Bull president Jerome Meyer also told the press conference the company was profitable, adding the company aimed to improve profits over time.     Honeywell Inc earlier today received 527 mln dlrs in cash for the sale of 57.5 pct of its computer business to Bull and NEC. Honeywell will retain a 42.5 pct interest in Honeywell Bull and Bull will own an equal amount.     NEC owns 15 pct of the company.     Meyer, who had been executive vice president of Honeywell Information Systems, said Honeywell Bull would work closely with NEC and Bull in both developing new products and marketing computers to multi-national companies.     \"We haven\'t been growing as fast as we\'d like, but we are going to turn that around,\" Meyer said. He said business was  soft in the U.S.     He said the company was reorganizing its distribution programs and its staff, reassigning and laying off selected employees. He also said the company was hiring new workers.     Honeywell Bull chairman Jacques Stern, who is also chairman of Bull, said he believed the computer industry could be a fast growing market for companies that provide the type of computers customers want. \"I don\'t believe in the slump of the market,\" he said.     The computer company would offer open systems so that customers would not be tied to a specific vendor or architecture, and it will also focus on tying computers together through communications networks.  \n',26

The company reported its 1986 profits were 44 pct lower at 154.6 mln guilders than in the year before.      Turnover was 18 pct lower than in 1985.      The main reason fo the fall in turnover was the lower rate of the dollar, the company said. The lower costs for raw materials and energy, resulting from the lower dollar, could not compensate the fall in revenues.

'Hudson\'s Bay Co said a writeoff of 40.4 mln dlrs, or 1.39 dlrs per share, that it took in 1986 was mainly due to its investment in Dome Petroleum Ltd DMP.      The company reported an operating profit of 33.0 mln dlrs, or 32 cts per share, for fiscal 1986, compared to an operating loss of 9,055,000 dlrs, or 1.23 dlrs per share, in the previous year.      Hudson\'s Bay holds about four mln shares of Dome\'s 10 pct series one cumulative subordinate convertible preferred shares.     Last March, Dome suspended payment of dividends on all preferred shares until June 1, 1987. The shares give the holder the right to convert to Dome common shares at 3.33 dlrs per share.     Dome has the right to force conversion if Dome common reaches 3.885 dlrs per share. Dome is trading at 1.12 dlrs per share, down one ct, today on the Toronto Stock Exchange.     Hudson\'s Bay also said it had an increase in 1986 in retail operating profit to 185.3 mln dlrs from 111.4 mln dlrs, but that was partially offset by an increase of 14.9 mln dlrs in interest costs and 25.3 mln dlrs in taxes.      Hudson\'s Bay also said its Markborough properties subsidiary had an operating profit of 108.6 mln dlrs, up from 98.8 mln dlrs the year before.     Profit from non-Markborough real estate was 23.5 mln dlrs in 1986, down from 27.6 mln dlrs a year ago.     Operating profit from natural resources was 4.2 mln dlrs, up 1.2 mln dlrs from the prior year. Pensions costs were reduced by 34.9 mln dlrs due to an accounting change. Total debt declined during the year by 251 mln dlrs to 2.28 billion dlrs and debt to equity ratio improved to 1.8 to one from 2.1 to one.  \n',26
'Hutchison Whampoa Ltd HWHH.HK expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said.     He did not make any specific projections for the company\'s earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.     It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year, equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share split.     Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.     The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper, compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining shares.     Li said Hong Kong\'s property market remains strong while its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth.     Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.     But he said Hong Kong\'s large trade deficit with the U.S. May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the British colony.     He said all of the company\'s major operations showed improved results in 1986.     Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd HKEH.HK to Cavendish International Holdings Ltd, itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric.     Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share.     Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.     The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.     Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from the government for the spin-off.     He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites. Its major assets are the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel, property development, and interests in Husky Oil Ltd HYO.TO of Canada and Pearson Plc PSON.L of Britain.  \n',26

'Jacobs Suchard AG JACZ.Z hopes for another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986 net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said.     The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs.     Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the company\'s target of five pct real annual growth, had been made possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986 which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year.     Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24 billion francs was due to currency factors.     A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset by growth in operations and by structural changes within the group.     Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.     Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25 pct against 25.3 pct.     Pohl said the group\'s average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further increase in tax levels was expected in future.     Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln the previous year.  \n',26
'Jaguar Plc JAGR.L is about to sell its new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference.     Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly below 1985\'s 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of the new model had kept this year\'s pre-tax profit down.     Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.     U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover, finance director John Edwards said.     A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an \"umbrella\" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car\'s price.     Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.     In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct.     Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg, but Egan said this would take at least another three years     On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar\'s shares were last quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday\'s close, after reporting 1986 results which were in line with market expectations, dealers said. ... \n',26
'The extended decline in Japan\'s overall business performance was likely to bottom out in the current January-March quarter, the Finance Ministry said.     Improved corporate earnings and better prospects for the stability of the yen had made companies more optimistic, it said after carrying out a quarterly survey.     The survey, conducted in February, was based on questionnaires returned by 8,328 large and small firms in all sectors except the finance and insurance industries.     The survey said overall corporate earnings were expected to turn positive with an estimated 0.4 pct year on year increase in the second half of fiscal 1986 ending on March 31 after a 5.4 pct decrease in the first half.     Corporate earnings will grow further in the first half of fiscal 1987, rising an estimated 10.7 pct, it added.     Manufacturers\' earnings, hit hard by the yen\'s steady rise against the dollar, will rise 7.7 pct in first-half fiscal 1987 after falling 10.7 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, it said.     Overall earnings of non-manufacturing companies will rise 11.8 pct year on year in the first half of fiscal 1987 after growing 9.8 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, the survey said.     It said this figure was bolstered by profits of firms such as electric power and gas companies which have benefitted from the yen\'s appreciation.  \n',26
'Current profits of Japan\'s major firms in the October-December quarter rose four pct from a year earlier to 5,654 billion yen against a 2.6 pct year-on-year rise in the preceding quarter, the Finance Ministry said.     The improved earnings resulted mainly from a 22.5 pct profit increase in non-manufacturing industries, supported by an 88.7 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain in real estate, according to a ministry survey.     Total sales of the 15,308 firms with capital of 10 mln yen or more which responded to the poll, fell one pct to 217,217 billion yen against a 1.2 pct fall the previous quarter.     Current profits of manufacturing industries in the fourth quarter dropped 13.7 pct to 2,394 billion yen against a 22.1 pct fall in the preceding quarter, the ministry said.     Plant and equipment investments of all firms polled fell 3.9 pct to 8,004 billion yen, compared with a 1.4 percent fall the previoius quarter.     Ministry officials said the survey showed that the Japanese economy is in a delicate stage in which it is hard to tell if economic growth has stopped deteriorating or if the economy is heading for a recovery.  \n',26
'Japanese corporate earnings will rise 8.9 pct in fiscal 1987/88 for the first year-on-year increase in three years, partly because of the yen\'s stable exchange rate, the Nomura research institute said.     Sales of all industries are predicted to rise 1.9 pct in the year, which starts April 1, the research arm of Nomura Securities Co said in a statement.     Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in the current fiscal year with sales forecast to drop 14 pct.     The forecast assumes an average rate of 148.5 yen to the dollar in 1987/88, compared with 160 yen in the current year.     Corporate efforts to cope with the yen\'s appreciation, such as cutting production costs, are expected to bear fruit next fiscal year, the institute said. The economy should also benefit from pump-priming expected from the government and a halt in rising prices of manufactured goods, it said.     Recurrent profits of manufacturing industries are projected to rise 29.6 pct next fiscal year against an estimated 40.1 pct fall in the current year.     Non-manufacturing sector profits will decline 4.5 pct in 1987/88 against an estimated 2.2 pct rise in the current year, it said.  \n',26
'Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd JARD.HKG said it planned a bonus issue of four new \"B\" shares of 20 H.K. Cents each for every ordinary share of par value two dlrs.     A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total 1987 dividend of four cents per \"B\" share, while the \"A\" share dividend will be maintained at last year\'s level of 40 cents a share.     Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986 net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985.     Shareholders\' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from 4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said.     It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd HKLD.HKG, Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan.     He said the group\'s stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a reorganisation, is \"a long term investment and now stands at a level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset imbalance.\"     Keswick said the issue of new \"B\" shares will give the group \"the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which has been brought about through the group\'s recent restructuring.\"     He said the new issue is pending approval from both the firm\'s shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.     The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation, with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to the new unit Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd.     Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two companies spun off from Hk Land -- Mandarin Oriental International Ltd and Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd -- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson.     Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrs last year, will become debt free after the restructuring.     \"A positive cash flow from operations and disposals, continuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet,\" Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests in airfreight operations, Australian properties and trucking business, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities.     Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its general trading business in the Middle East in view of the continuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he said the operations would be profitable in the longer term.     He said the firm\'s function \"has evolved into one primarily of strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy.\"     He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the board of directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacific regional board. He gave no further details of the change.     Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs at midday on the Hong Kong stock market. In early trading it had fallen to 24.30 dlrs because of rumours yesterday that the firm planned a rights issue.  \n',26
'A strong performance by its retail businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd JARD.HKG to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in 1986, stock analysts said.     They tolds they expect the firm to show earnings of between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln in 1985.     The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a share in 1985.     James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson\'s 1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income to retail sales.     Analysts said the group\'s 7-Eleven retail stores and its franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.     Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine Matheson\'s 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465 mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.     But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson\'s earnings from its 35 pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd HKLD.HKG will fall to about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.     The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong Kong Land of Dairy Farm International Ltd last September.     Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the year as part of its retail business, which will increase its overall retail income figures.     Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct share of Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd.     Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986 of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.     Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln dlrs of 1985, while the company\'s term debt remained at about the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.     But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.     Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its diverse interests.     It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd in which it has a 41 pct interest.     A company statement issued last month said the firm will use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.     Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is likely to develop its own business, analysts said.     \"The future of the stock will depend on the firm\'s ability to creatively structure some new acquisitions,\" said Hargreaves of Hoare Govett.     He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its existing business.  \n',26
'John Labatt Ltd anticipates a good fourth quarter and a new peak in sales and earnings for the fiscal year ending April 30, president Peter Widdrington told financial analysts.     He would not make any specific forecast, but said he was optimistic for further growth in fiscal 1988 in the company\'s brewing and food products operations.     Labatt\'s earnings rose to 92.8 mln dlrs in the nine months ended January 31 from year-earlier 78 mln dlrs. Revenue for the nine months rose to 3.20 billion dlrs from 2.70 billion dlrs.     Widdrington said Labatt\'s three-year business plan, now being updated, targets total sales of about six billion dlrs, including 2.50 billion dlrs in the U.S.     Labatt, Canada\'s leading brewer, has expanded in the U.S. food products industry by acquisitions.     Widdrington said Labatt\'s strategy for U.S. expansion stemmed partly from its strong market position in the Canadian food and beverage industry. The U.S. share of revenues for this year will be about 35 pct, rising to 40 pct in fiscal 1988, he said.  \n',26

'Kloeckner &amp; Co KGaA, the international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.     The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.     It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary because of recent declines in raw material prices.     Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in prices as well as the lower value of the dollar.     It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held largely by family foundations.

'The Fried. Krupp GmbH KRPG.D steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory 1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to 18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.     Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5 billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from 16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.     Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar\'s weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.     The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.     Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had underpinned machinery and component activities.     An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the trading and services sectors, affected the group\'s total order figures.     However, \"all business sectors contributed to the positive results achieved in 1986,\" Krupp added, without giving details.     Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9 billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of orders against 40 pct in 1985.     Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11 member companies which comprise the core area of the group, rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.     The group\'s orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.     Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.     The steel market weakened increasingly over the year, mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer industries.     The difficult market for sections and flats of quality steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said. But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless cold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.  \n',26
'Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG [OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard Wagner said.     Wagner told a news conference that last year\'s 34.3 pct rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling interest rates.     The bank, Austria\'s third largest, raised its 1986 dividend to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.     Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: \"We will endeavour to maintain the higher dividend in 1987.\"     Laenderbank\'s balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7 billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.     Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business chiefly on the dollar\'s fall against the schilling, which is effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar\'s weakness had wiped some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.     Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from the bank\'s London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said that it came close to one mln stg.     On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed 8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.     According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct. Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.  \n',26
'London and Scottish Marine Oil Plc (Lasmo) LASL.L will have an advantage when oil prices rise again and it is confident this will happen early in the next decade, the company said in a statement accompanying results.     Lasmo said its advantage comes from its reserves of oil and gas which at the end of 1986 stood at 210 mln barrels of oil equivalent, a group record. Reserves have increased every year since 1983 at a compounded rate of 10 pct a year.     The company reported a 1986 pretax profit of 4.4 mln stg, down from 118 mln in 1985.     It said falling oil prices caused the downturn.     The company said it reacted swiftly to the sharp drop in oil prices which began over a year ago. Capital expenditure, which had been budgeted at over 150 mln stg, was cut to 51 mln stg net of disposals. Managers responded well to the demand for lower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide.     The company said had very few exploration wells committed for 1987 and therefore retains maximum flexibility in its exploration program. Even without further success, the existing fields and recent discoveries will contribute significantly to profit and cash flow for some years to come, it said.     Lasmo shares were down 2p at 251 after the announcement.  \n',26
'Laurentian Group Corp said it expects 1987 earnings per share will show about the same proportionate increase as in 1986.     Last year, the company had 25.7 mln dlrs operating profit, or 76 cts per share, up from 11.1 mln dlrs, or 59 cts per share, in 1985. Shares outstanding increased to 39 mln from 27.8 mln.

Castonguay said Laurentian Group Corp, the parent firm, plans to fill out its national financial services distribution system and make further acquisitions if the right opportunity occurs.

'Engineering group Linde AG\'s LING.F world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks in the first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same 1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said.     But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and incoming orders increased 1.0 pct.     Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group 1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln.     Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to 394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln.     Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13 to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde\'s authorised share capital currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks.     Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for acquisitions. He declined to give further details.     While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91 billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming orders would have been four pct above the prior year\'s level.     World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4 pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to 739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge.     World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05 billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05 billion marks.     Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in the refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and order gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks.     The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group sales rising 12.4 pct to 1.52 billion marks and incoming orders gaining 8.0 pct to 1.57 billion marks.

'Shell U.K. Ltd\'s pre-tax profit on exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in 1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices last year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.     But he told a press conference that due to the high marginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact of the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330 mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.     The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, with Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, he said.     As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration and production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.     Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group RD.AS, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg, up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against 8.81 mln.     Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company\'s crude oil output from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986, which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the company. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the current year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline in output from the major Brent field, he said.     Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to be maintained in 1987, he said.     A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months, Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5 billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil price fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.     Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North Sea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.     Day to day operating costs of the exploration and production sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target is to keep costs per barrel constant.     The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to the discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.     Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.     Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit Shell U.K. Oil, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987 were a \"bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.\"     In November and December in particular, refining operations had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil product prices, he said. He expected margins to continue generally positive over the summer, although they could dip to become negative from time to time, depending on price movements.     A new catalytic cracker at Shell\'s Stanlow refinery will now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five months behind schedule, following a crane accident which severely damaged the plant last year, he said.     Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from 11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical site.     Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against PRT, was \"helpful,\" but rather less than had been hoped for.     Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in the range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he would expect some over-production above OPEC\"s official 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.     He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain output was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance, but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will fall.  \n',26
'Lucas Industries Plc LUCS.L said its underlying performance would continue to improve in the second half but profits would be restrained by low activity in U.K. Commercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in North American electronics.     The company earlier reported a two mln stg rise in pretax profit to 40 mln in the six months to end-January. The figure was some five mln below forecasts and Lucas shares dropped sharply to 557.5p at 1130 GMT from last night\'s close of 590p.     It said it would continue with plans for all its activities to be internationally competitive and profitable.     Costs of restructuring, reorganisation, employee training and retraining, particularly in the UK automotive businesses, together with high research and development spending would affect profits in the short term.     But Lucas said it was exploiting growth opportunities in automotive markets, especially in vehicle breaking and engine management systems. Recent acquisitions in North America had strengthened Lucas Aerospace and Lucas Industrial systems.  \n',26
'Consolidated attributable net profit of Ste Lyonnaise des Eaux LYOE.PA is likely to rise by at least 10 pct this year from the 360 mln francs reported for 1986, Chairman Jerome Monod told a news conference.     Group turnover should rise about seven pct from the 15.7 mln reported for this year, while group investments should total around 1.8 billion francs, somewhat above the 1.3 billion annual average of the past three years, he added.     Investments will be aimed mainly at developing the group\'s leisure industry, health and communications activities, Monod said.     In the leisure sector the group planned a joint development with Club Mediterranee CMI.PA, Club Med, of a 200 hectare pleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of Eastern Central France, he said.     Wholly-owned subsidiary Lyonnaise de Developpement Touristique would carry out the construction work and financial planning of the development which would be leased to Club Med as operator of the complex, he said.     He gave no financial details but said leisure sector investments would total about 100 mln francs over the next three years.     Investments in the communications industry would go mainly to develop the group\'s cable television activities and its 25 pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recently won the concession to operate a sixth television channel in France.     Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mln francs over the next four years, of which Lyonaise des Eaux would provide about 175 mln, Monod said.     Monod said Metropole aimed to win a 15 to 20 pct audience share and to capture about 10 pct of the national television advertising market.     Total investment by the group in the communications sector, including cable activities, would be between 300 mln and 400 mln francs over the next five years, mainly concentrated in the coming year.     Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mln and 200 mln over the five years, with the aim of widening the audience to 280,000 subscribers from 12,000, and boosting turnover to around 450 mln francs a year from 10 mln.  \n',26
'Mannesmann AG MMWG.F expects a difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief executive Werner Dieter told a news conference.     Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer nations.     Domestic business was also declining and orders for West German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986, Dieter said.     Mannesmann\'s profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.     Dieter said Mannesmann\'s pipe activities would suffer a set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started last year, were now having an effect.     Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann\'s turnover. The company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter said had become one of Mannesmann\'s \"strategic aims.\"     He said the company\'s drive to combine activities in mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular \"plus point\" for Mannesmann.     Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.     It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar and lack of demand for steel pipe.

MMAL, 99 pct-owned by Mitsubishi Motors Corp MIMT.T and Mitsubishi Corp MITT.T,  said a tight market meant it had failed to recover 19 mln dlrs in costs sustained because of a weak Australian dollar.

'Morgan Grenfell Group Plc said its 1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc GUIN.L shares and because of securities trading losses in the U.S.     Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group\'s seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some eight mln stg to 82.2 mln.     He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal approaches about a takeover of the group but was not interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not elaborate.     Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during the brewing company\'s successful bid for Distillers Co Plc DIST.L in the first half of last year.     The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price during the bid.     Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness affair.     Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier, resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider information. He currently faces criminal charges.     Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been \"one of the most traumatic in our history,\" but that clients and staff had been supportive.     \"I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet.\"     Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from corporate finance activities and progress in asset management.     Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the performance of the group so far in 1987 was \"within reasonable touch of the budget.\"     Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as interim director after Reeves\' resignation, and hopes to have a new chief executive within a few months.     He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of 562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said.     Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on yesterday\'s 375p. ... \n',26

However, chairman Randall Fields told a news conference the company would not move into any new countries during 1987 but would intensify its efforts where it already had stores.

Nationwide Life Insurance Co earned 62.8 mln dlrs in 1985, with last year\'s profit including record capital gains of 14.4 mln dlrs, up from gains of 2.6 mln dlrs the previous year.     The company said its property-casualty group had a record loss from insurance operations last year of 859 mln dlrs after policyholders\' dividends, up 25 pct from 1985\'s 710 mln dlrs.     Nationwide said a surge in claims from personal auto insurance and the volatile commercial liability coverages during a period of unprecedented sales growth generated the loss.     The company said over 576 mln dlrs of last year\'s group losses came from commercial insurance lines and 282 mln dlrs from its personal auto insurance business.     Partially offsetting 1986\'s record insurance losses, Nationwide said, were record investment gains of 775 mln dlrs and a 28 mln dlr federal tax credit.

The company estimated parent company current losses at 15 billion yen in 1986/87, including a gain of 95 billion yen from the sale of securities.

'Norcen Energy Resources Ltd, 41 pct owned by Hees International Corp, said earnings and cash flow will improve in 1987, even if oil and gas prices remain at 1986 levels.     The improvement will result from production increases, lower taxes and royalties, reduced financing costs and from operating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during 1986, the company said in the annual report.     Norcen previously reported 1986 earnings, excluding a 20.1 mln dlr writeoff, declined by 58 pct to 50.0 mln dlrs from 119.7 mln dlrs in in 1985.     Norcen\'s 1986 cash flow fell 10 pct to 204.9 mln dlrs from 228.9 mln dlrs in the prior year.     It said the sharp decline in oil prices during 1986 was the most significant factor for Norcen\'s reduced performance.     \"While financial results are far from the previous year\'s record levels, it is clear that Norcen has withstood declining prices and remains financially and operationally strong,\" Norcen said.

He said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new investments.     Rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25 francs, unchanged on 1985. Parent company net profit last year rose to 99.5 mln francs against 71.1 mln in 1985.     Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln francs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against 147 mln, was attributable to the group. He said the lower profit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker Vallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake.

'The state oil company Petroeleos de Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said.     Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly, Hernandez said PDVSA\'s income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last year\'s 13.3 billion.     Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said \"had a very serious impact on Venezuela.\"     PDVSA\'s export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined products.     The figure surpassed PDVSA\'s stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year.     The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank. Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA\'s overseas refining and marketing operations.     Consumption in Venezuela\'s internal market increased from 323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However, Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd.     Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of Venezuela\'s reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country\'s production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.      Venezuela\'s total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986 were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the world, Hernandez said.  \n',26

The FT is subject to a 70 mln stg investment programme, with the printing and publishing operation moving to a new plant in the London docklands next year.

'Pharmacia AB PHAB ST forecast earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs 821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained at their present parities.     Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.     A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed on currency movements.     Last year\'s results were also badly hit by a once-off writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.     The company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over.     The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.     Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it having used more funds than generated by group operations, mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular Inc.  \n',26
'Sports carmaker Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG PSHG.F said it expects to post a satisfactory profit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower but U.S. Sales anticipated higher.     Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic sales were expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from 11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000 from 28,670 last year.     Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Last month the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70 mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86.     For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume this year to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254, Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit were based on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, he added.     The expected drop in West German sales this year would be the result of the so-called \"grey market\" for Porsche cars, he said. When the dollar was strong against the mark, many Porsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegal export to the U.S.     Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87 first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period.     The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a larger percentage of overall sales this year than before does not pose problems for profit, the Porsche board said.     In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around 20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same time Porsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the 1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki.     Branitzki put Porsche\'s hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mln marks.     In a speech to the annual meeting, Schutz said third-party orders placed with Porsche\'s engineering research centre in Weissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year for the first time.

'Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG PSHG.F said earnings in first half year 1986/87 were \"satisfactory\" despite burdens caused by the dollar\'s weakness against the mark and stagnating domestic demand.     In its semi-annual shareholders\' report, Porsche said first half turnover fell six pct to 1.71 billion marks from 1.83 billion in the same period of 1985/86.     However, earnings were satisfactory, it said, without giving absolute figures.     Domestic turnover fell 26 pct to 283 mln marks from 380 mln.     Foreign turnover dipped to 1.43 billion marks from 1.45 billion in the first half of last year, although the export quota rose to 83 pct from 79 pct.     The car sector accounted for 1.51 billion marks of turnover, against 1.63 billion the year earlier, it said.     Production dropped five pct to 25,876 cars from 27,381. Manufacture of the 911 and 928 models rose six pct to 11,122 from 10,533 units but production of 924 and 944 models was cut by 12 pct to 14,754 units from 16,848 and would be cut further, the report said.     Car sales fell four pct to 25.269 units from 26,414 in the comparable half year, the report said. U.S. Demand continued for all models but demand fell in other markets.     Domestic sales were 39 pct down at 3,267 units from 5,397, while sales abroad rose five pct to 22,002 from 21,017. Share of exports in sales rose to 87 pct from 80 pct.

'Precambrian Shield Resources Ltd, earlier reporting a large loss against year-ago profit, said the 1986 loss was mainly due to a 51,187,000 dlr writedown on its U.S. operations, uneconomic coal and other mineral properties.

'A spokesman for Preussag AG PRSG.F said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay a dividend on 1986 results     He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following a difficult year in 1985.     Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.     The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the group\'s other divisions.     The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions.     Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.     The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before. Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.     The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.     The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results.     Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year.     Preussag\'s domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.     Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison figures.     Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0 pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.     Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC) subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year.     AMC\'s large losses in 1985, caused principally by the international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world group losses that year.  \n',26

'Prudential Corporation Plc, which earlier announced a 62 pct rise in 1986 pre-tax profits, said it had recorded its best general insurance result for six years but had not reached satisfactory levels of profit in other areas.     Group Chief Executive Brian Corby told a news conference that despite returning to trading profits, the International division and the Mercantile and General division had not reached satisfactory levels.     But he said he welcomed Mercantile and General trading profits in 1986 and was optimistic about both that and the International division.     The acquisition of the U.S. Life company Jackson National had a small effect in 1986 but its full effect would be felt in the 1987 results, Corby said.     The Group also intended to expand the number of its estate agency firms bought last year, and hoped they will comprise between 10 and 15 pct of total company profits in the future.     \"We hope they will be very profitable very shortly.

The agency\'s holding of U.S. government securities yielded a return of 20.7 pct for the year, significantly more than either the 14.1 pct earned on the total bond portfolio or the 13.5 pct for all funds under management.     \"These high liquidity securities, which are held on a temporary basis and for purposes of strategy and the protection of the overall bond portfolio, have been efficient,\" the agency said of the U.S. securities.     The agency said it has 7.9 billion dlrs invested in Canadian private sector businesses after channeling 965 mln dlrs of new funds into this area in 1986.     The Caisse said it acquired 825 mln of new Government of Quebec bonds and 342 mln dlrs of new securities from other Quebec government issuers during the year.      \n',26
'The Jordan branch of Iraq\'s Rafidain Bank said it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country\'s minimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits from its operations in the country.     Jordan\'s government asked banks in early 1985 to comply with the new capital requirement -- raised from three mln dinars -- by the start of 1986.     Rafidain\'s Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi tolds the branch had now registered its capital at the higher level but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. The bank\'s 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars.     Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher capital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided instead to close its operation, banking sources said.     Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, while the branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash.     Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an exception in Rafidain\'s case, allowing it longer to comply. They said the gesture refelcted close political ties between Jordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad\'s financial difficulties.     The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to 550,332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars.  \n',26
'Rank Organisation Plc RANK.L said trading in the current year had continued satisfactorily taking into account seasonal fluctuations.     Association companies, such as Rank-Xerox Ltd, indicated an improved performance, a statement issued at the annual meeting said.     It said it planned to spend some 15 mln stg on refurbishing its Odeon cinema chain and the Rank Film Distributors unit was committed to spending 20 mln to secure international distribution rights of films.     Investment in new activities in 1987 should continue at a relatively high level to exploit opportunities for growth. Rank said it did not exclude the possibility of making large as well as small acquisitions.     In the year to end-October, Rank reported a rise in pretax profits to 164.1 mln stg from 136.0 mln previously.     Rank shares firmed in morning trading to be quoted at 712p at 1320 GMT after 697p at last night\'s close.  \n',26

'State-owned engine maker Rolls Royce Plc launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is likely to miss contracts to power the proposed Airbus Industrie A340 aircraft.     The company\'s so-called \"pathfinder prospectus\" gives all the details of its stock market flotation except for the price at which shares will be offered.     Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before.     Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit for 1987.     Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings.     Assuming the company was valued at around eight times earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about 1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards.     BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion.     The price will be increased by it being likely to have much of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the company\'s health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.     When the government announced the sale, it said it would inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250 mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.     Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit rating to match those of its main competitors such as General Electric Co GE.N and United Technologies Corp\'s UTX.N Pratt and Whitney unit.  \n',26
'Rowntree Mackintosh Plc RWNT.L announced it made a pretax profit of 84 mln stg in the 53 weeks ending January 3, 1987, compared with 79.3 mln stg in the previous year.     Turnover was up to 1.29 billion stg from 1.2 billion. A final dividend of 9.2p was proposed, after a final 8.2p last year. Earnings per share rose to 35p from 34.8p.     The results were broadly in line with market expectations, leaving shares at 499p in early trading, up one pence from yesterday\'s close, but slightly off pre-announcement opening levels.     Profit on ordinary activities after tax was 66.2 mln stg, up from the previous year\'s 60.7 mln.     The U.K. Remained Rowntree\'s largest centre for trading profits, accounting for 47.9 mln stg, up from 45.3 mln in 1985. Profit from its second largest geographical area, North America, slipped to 34.7 mln stg from 37.2 mln. North American profits were affected by the fall of the value of the dollar.     Operations in continental Europe made 7.8 mln stg in trading profit, up from 3.4 mln, with 4.0 mln stg made in Australasia, up from 2.3 mln, and 11.3 mln stg from the rest of the world, against 13.1 mln in the previous year.     Extraordinary items amounted to a 11.3 mln debit after a 16.5 mln debit previously. A company spokesman said this represented additional provisions for the cost of rationalisation plans announced in earlier years.     Rowntree expects North American operations will this year, ahead of company expectations, be of the same order as those from the U.K. And the rest of Europe combined, the statement said. A spokesman said no specific figures had been forecast.     Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide, including further moves in the speciality retailing business which Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said.     Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast by chairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performance of seven businesses bought last year was encouraging.     The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share and increased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concern increased profit and Rowntree\'s small health food business, Holgates, raised earnings 10-fold, the statement said.     Offsetting factors included currency movements, which cost the company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profits on confectionery operations, and the company faced strong competition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets.  \n',26
'Royal Bank of Canada, in reporting a 19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to report improved results in future earnings periods.     \"Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income, highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the periods ahead,\" chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.     The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year ago.     Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank\'s international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.     The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103 mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs from 42 mln dlrs last year.     Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.     Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.     The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to 98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.  \n',26
'Royal Trustco Ltd, in a move unique among Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its yearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said.     First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst Michael Walsh said Royal Trust\'s international growth target is attainable. But it \"will be a tremendous achievement because ... they\'re going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies,\" Walsh said.     Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust\'s 154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company profit, Cornelissen tolds in an interview.     He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26 pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.     Royal Trust, Canada\'s second largest trust company with assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank.     Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.     The company\'s overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980, Cornelissen said.     Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical Co DOW\'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset management, merchant and private banking companies.     \"It was a heaven-sent opportunity,\" Cornelissen said of the Dow Financial acquisition. \"We achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up.\"     Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage, in order to exploit \"profitable niches\" overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management, private banking and advisory services.     He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations \"before the end of this month\" to sell its London-based Savory Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal.     \"The international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business,\" he said, adding that in trust-type services, \"we don\'t think the international markets are well-served.\"     Aiding Royal Trust\'s foreign growth are greater foreign  investment interest in North America and increased Canadian investment abroad, Cornelissen said.     Central to Royal Trust\'s strategy is Asia, boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust.     Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia will contain two-thirds of the world\'s population and 50 pct of global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, \"We knew we had to be there.\" Royal Trust\'s 14 international locations include offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.     The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the \"immediate future,\" although \"we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities.\"     Asked about Royal Trust\'s plans for the U.S., which the company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units, Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks.     \"That doesn\'t mean to say we shouldn\'t be in the U.S.,\" said Cornelissen. \"That is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years.\"     He said the company would continue to emphasize its home Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.     Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks, trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in one another\'s actitivies will mean more domestic competition for Royal Trust, \"but not drastically more,\" Cornelissen said.  \n',26
'Rugby Portland Cement Plc RBYL.L said it was well placed to operate in the new circumstances following the ending in February of the 53-year old cement manufacturers common price and marketing arrangements.     In a statement following the release of its 1986 results, IT stated that the current year had started well. It reported that pretax profits in the year rose to 35.46 mln stg from 21.84 mln previously on turnover higher at 313.3 mln after 252.2 mln.     The strong recovery of the first six months continued into the second half, although U.K. Cement demand rose only modestly. Results benefitted from cost cutting and higher volumes.     The decision by the Cement Makers Federation to end the pricing agreement reflected pressure from higher competition due to growing imports and the possibility that the system would be taken to the Restrictive Practices Court by the U.K. Government. It stated that its John Carr unit benefitted from strong organic growth, although overseas its Cockburn operation had a difficult period with high maintenance costs and increased depreciation charges.     The company is proposing to change its name at the next annual meeting to Rugby Group Plc.     Rugby said it spent 27 mln stg on acquisitions in 1986. It noted that its Western Australia hotels company had agreed to sell the Parmelia hotel for 31.5 mln Australian dlrs, some seven mln stg above end-1986 book value.     The results were largely in line with forecasts and Rugby shares were little changed at 242p after 241 at Friday\'s close.  \n',26
'Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer, Santos Ltd STOS.S, said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).     The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985.     Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate.     Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.     It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders\' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.     Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company TMOC Resources Ltd -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs.     Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.     Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program, finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year.     Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.     Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.     But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.     \"It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australia\'s oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,\" Massy-Green said.  \n',26
'The Sanwa Bank Ltd\'s three-year business plan foresees securities and international operations making a greater contribution to operating profits, a bank official said.     The bank\'s plan also emphasises retail and medium and small-sized business operations, he tolds.     Officials at Fuji Bank Ltd and Mitsubishi Bank Ltd outlined similar three-year plans.     They said lower interest rates and financial liberalisation have cut profits from dealings with big firms to nearly nothing.     \"They don\'t need us, they can do their own financing,\" one official said.     Sanwa Bank\'s plan forecasts that securities and international operations will contribute 40 pct of total operating profits by the end of the fiscal year ending March, 1990, compared with 30 pct in fiscal 1985, the Sanwa official said.  \n',26
'Saudi Arabia\'s 11 commercial banks are reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non- performing loans.     Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year.     But the kingdom\'s still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable.     One senior bank credit officer said \"The work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions, but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money.\"     The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia\'s corporate sector in 1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad decline.     The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom\'s banks had sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world oil prices tumbled.     Of the kingdom\'s nine joint-venture banks which operate on the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at the expense of increased provisions.     The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, United Saudi Commercial Bank (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln riyals, marginally less than 1985\'s shortfall of 17.0 mln.     Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to 60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985.     Other results released so far show Saudi American Bank (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7 mln riyals, while Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi, known as Saudi French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals.     Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp\'s CCI.N Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez, increased provisions sharply.     Arab National Bank\'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1 mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln riyals.     Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non- performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the Saudi economy bottoms out.     Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity, but one banker said \"The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions.\"     From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom\'s largest bank National Commercial Bank (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector, bankers calculated.     Between 1982 and 1985, Riyad Bank, NCB\'s rival as the second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine.     Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non-performing.     Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres.     Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank as the strongest earners.     Other banks such as Saudi British Bank, 40 pct owned by the British Bank of the Middle East, are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base.     Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions.     Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a Saudi bank go under and not only supported Saudi Cairo Bank after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to Saudi Investment Bank and USCB.     The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans.     And while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending, conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products.     One banker said \"Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not good.\"     Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return on their money.     In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer funds are held on current account.  \n',26
'Sandoz AG SANZ.Z would have reported a percentage rise in net profits \"close to double figures\" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for November\'s warehouse fire, a senior company official said.     The official, who declined to be identified, tolds Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which caused severe pollution of the Rhine.     Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share.     This year began well, with the performance in January and February at least equal to the same period last year, the official said.     The company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on April 22.     Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident.     The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the \"one pct\" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire.     Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the Rhine since the accident.     However, the official said the final figure would be \"much less than that cited in earlier comments.\" He gave no further details.     In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy CIGZ.Z, which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were also hit by the falling dollar, the official said.     Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to 8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said.     Net profit at Ciba-Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billion francs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs.     The third major Swiss chemical company, F.

The company\'s operating loss for the nine months ended December 31, 1986 increased to 7.7 mln dlrs from a loss of 1.7 mln dlrs in the prior year, it said earlier.

'Royal Dutch/Shell Group RD.AMS unit Shell Australia Ltd, said its net profit fell to 45.79 mln dlrs in 1986 from 66.76 mln in 1985.     Revenue fell to 4.55 billion dlrs from 4.91 billion, in an extremely competitive and over-regulated environment, chairman and chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement. A 26.25 mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a very disappointing year.     \"A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a very meagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation of around 10 pct,\" he said.     Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on downstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns and the financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project.     Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrs against 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation.     \"It is just as important for Australia to maintain a financially healthy, technically advanced refining and marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and production,\" he said.     \"The Australian oil industry has the experience and the capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the government would stop putting roadblocks in our way,\" he said.     Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to upgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but further investment required an appropriate rate of return, he said.     Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 18.77 mln dlrs from 26.35 mln, while investment in property and plant rose to 374.25 mln from 353.94 mln a year earlier.     Gosper said oil companies would be under intense pressure in 1987 because of forecast slow economic growth.  \n',26
'Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, anticipates an improved level of earnings in 1987, assuming a continuation of prices and margins that existed at the end of 1986 and early 1987, the company said in the annual report.     Shell previously reported 1986 operating profit fell to 130 mln dlrs, excluding a 24 mln dlr unusual gain, from 146 mln dlrs in the prior year.     The company also said 1987 capital and exploration spending of 420 mln dlrs will be 160 mln dlrs lower than last year, due to the uncertain short-term outlook. \n',26
'Shell Francaise SFMF.PA, a subsidiary of Shell Petroleum NV, returned to the black last year for the first time since 1982, with parent company net profit of 43 mln francs against losses of 968 mln in 1985 and 1.07 billion in 1984. In 1982 it posted a profit of 329 mln.     The company said in a statement that cash flow had improved strongly although it remained negative at 182 mln francs against 1.34 billion in 1985, due largely to improved performances by its main profit centres.     It said the results could have been even better had it not been for the collapse of refining and sales profit margins in the last quarter of the year.     In 1986 Shell sold 14.74 mln tonnes of oil products against 14.52 mln tonnes in 1985.     The company said the results were in line with its targets for the second year of its three-year recovery programme.

'World group turnover of Siemens AG SIEG.F should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five months, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.     Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02 billion marks.     Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to 21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about 19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.     In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.     In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8 billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.     For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.     Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the communications and telecommunications sectors in particular should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.     But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for 1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the dollar, Kaske said.     Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the same period in the previous year.     Turnover in the first five months rose particularly strongly in the installations and automotive technology, communications and telecommunications sectors, but components and energy and automation showed a sharp decline.     Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.     Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad was balanced by the decline in the dollar.     While the installations and automotive technology sector showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and communications orders were below the level achieved in the same period of 1985/86.     Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same level.     Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to 6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.  \n',26

'Singapore\'s major banks are diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from loans to debt instruments, banking sources said.     The banks following the trend are the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, United Overseas Bank Ltd, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation and the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd.     The shift towards securitisation has been helped by volatile financial markets which have developed hedging facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.     Loh tolds in an interview that Singapore banks see limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are switching from term lending to major growth areas such as stockbroking and fee based income, he said.     Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now moving into the new government securities market and the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.     One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity market in Singapore.     Loh said the banks\' participation in the stock market has increased business transactions and provided long term growth for the market. The banks are not competition for individual stockbroking firms because of the increased business they generate, he added.     Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because of the increasing ability of foreign and local market participants to absorb new issues.     Loh said OUB Investment management Ltd, a subsidiary of the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors seeking capital growth through a diversified international portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.     DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of the Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.     Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be forced to provide fund management services for major clients seeking better returns, he said.     Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from treasury and investment banking activities.     They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986.     Overseas Union\'s profits are expected to jump to over 40 mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.     The Development Bank\'s after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in 1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by National Discount Company Ltd before it became a subsidiary of the bank, they said.  \n',26
'Slough Estates Plc SLOU.L said it views the prospects during 1987 with confidence.     In a statement accompanying its 1986 results, it reported a rise of over 10 mln stg in 1986 pretax profit to 49.6 mln stg and said there are signs that the existing threat of excess supply may be lessened in 1987. There has also been a return of interest in industrial investment.     An external appraisal of the group\'s investment properties was carried out last year which found their gross value to be 851.3 mln stg as at Dec 31.  \n',26
'SNC Group Inc expects 1987 earnings to rise to 1.20-1.40 dlrs a share from 91 cts a share last year, with revenues climbing to about 430 mln dlrs from last year\'s 350 mln dlrs, president Alex Taylor said before the annual meeting.     SNC, Canada\'s second biggest engineering and construction group, became the country\'s largest ammunition manufacturer last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals Ltd from the Canadian government.     The impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt fully in 1987, Taylor said.     Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will account for more than half SNC\'s total 1987 revenues, helping to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and construction acivities, Taylor said.     Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small extraordinary gain.     In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and construction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defense products operations should be a major contributor to earnings.  \n',26
'France\'s Societe Generale SGEN.PA bank, which will be sold to the private sector in the second half of this year, reported increased profits for last year.     Societe Generale, one of the three largest state-owned banking groups, said in a statement that its parent company profit for 1986 totalled 800 mln francs, up 21.2 pct on 1985\'s 660 mln profit.     This was in line with earlier forecasts of profit of between 770 and 800 mln francs.     The bank\'s parent company gross operating profits were up 5.4 pct at 21.34 billion francs against 20.24 billion in 1985.     The increase in the bank\'s gross operating profits was mostly due to a rise in french franc deposits and personal loans as well as the development of its financial activities, Societe Generale said.     Parent company net banking earnings last year were also up at 13.9 billion francs compared with 13.57 billion in 1985 while operating costs totalled 7.44 billion francs against 6.67 billion the previous year.     Societe Generale President Marc Vienot said in December he expected group 1986 consolidated profits to rise to between 2.5 billion and 2.6 billion francs from 1.62 billion in 1985.  \n',26
'Sony Corp SNE.T group net income is expected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31 from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen, if the yen&#127;dollar rate remains at the present level, managing director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference.     Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending March 31, as its financial year will be changed to run from April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.     Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550 billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said.     The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yen in the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct.     The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen\'s recent appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.     The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar, reducing the company\'s total sales in the three month period by 40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.     Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 units in the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, while Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000 from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000 from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from 1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one mln due to lower exports to China.     Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said. Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three months compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.     Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total production in 1990 from the present 20 pct.     Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month period is estimated at around 17 billion yen, down 33 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 400 billion, down 12 pct.     Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April 1 1987, he added. The company made 41.9 billion yen group net profit in the year ended November 31 1986, down 42.6 pct from a year earlier, on sales of 1,325 billion, down 6.7 pct.  \n',26

'Spar Aerospace Ltd, reporting a sharply lower 1986 profit, said it anticipated solid profit and revenue growth during the next five years.     \"Looking to the longer term, Spar is confident that its continuing concentration on advanced robotics, satellite-based communications and electro-optical defense systems will lead to significant growth in revenues and earnings over the next five years,\" the company said.     It also forecast higher 1987 sales due to an increased order backlog. Revenues last year fell to 191 mln dlrs from 223.3 mln while profit fell to 4.4 mln dlrs from 13.1 mln.     Spar added that lower development costs in the communications group and a return to normal operations in gears and transmissions and aviation services \"will remove a serious drain on profits\" this year.     It attributed its reduced 1986 earnings to communications group losses resulting from continued heavy investment in new products and market development, a four-month strike at its Toronto plants and delays in receipt of authorization from customers to start work on new programs.  \n',26
'US Sprint, the 50-50 telephone venture of GTE Corp GTE and United Telecommunications Inc UT set up last June, is optimistic despite expecting to report a net loss of about 500 mln dlrs this year.      David M. Holland, president of US Sprint\'s Dallas-based Southwest Division, tolds in an interview that he did not know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreed that for the year the company should have about the same results as last year when it lost \"about 500 mln dlrs.\"      He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrs over \"two plus years\" to set up its network.      Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mln dlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in order to lease its lines.      He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optic telephone line are now \"in the ground,\" and 7,000 miles are operable.      By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company\'s subscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (instead of leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of the second quarter.     Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses along microscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and more economical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic line the diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of information as a copper cable 20 feet in diameter.      \"By the end of the year, we will have the capacity to carry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls,\" Holland said.     He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S. long distance market, with MCI Communications Corp MCIC about 10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct.      Holland said Sprint\'s rates, which were 50 pct lower than ATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephone exchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all the companies have equal access. He said the company was cutting back its advertising by about 30 pct this year.      At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its total number of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 to last January.     \"We\'ve captured the fiber high ground, shown the importance of it,\" he said.      Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said he believed ATT \"should be given some flexibility, but should be regulated on pricing plans.\"      \"They\'re so dominant in the market place,\" he said, adding that ATT should be deregulated when \"there is true competition in the marketplace.\"      \"It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money,\" he said, adding, \"maybe two to four years out, it\'s hard to say.\"     Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint\'s two owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, such as the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure on them to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings.      \"They are two excellent partners who have stated time and time again their support of US Sprint,\" he said, adding that he was \"amazed\" at industry talk that the two companies might be arguing. \"There\'s no evidence of that,\" he said.      He said Sprint\'s progress in such areas as revenues, number of customers and construction was on track, even \"ahead in many areas.\"     Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprint currently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in 90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988.     \"We want to be in every country that ATT serves,\" he said.     He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico but was working on it.      He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint, the forerunner of US Sprint, had been broken off by the September 1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation\'s telephone network.  \n',26
'Standard Bank Investment Corp Ltd (SPRJ.J) chairman Henri de Villiers said he could not predict profits for the bank this year because of South Africa\'s continuing political unrest.     De Villiers also warned in the annual report that \"failing prompt and decisive political action, South Africa faces a future of violent deadlock between different racial and political groupings.\"      He said South Africa\'s future economic prospects are \"clouded by political and social issues and in the absence of evidence that these are being positively addressed I am unable to offer an earnings forecast for 1987.\"     Standard Bank, 39 pct owned by Standard Chartered PLC  STCH.L, London, previously reported that 1986 net income rose by 13.8 pct to 209.0 mln rand.     The bank said its bad debt losses should begin to decline this year \"although it may take some time before they return to accepted industry norms.\"     The annual report showed that the bank\'s charge for bad and doubtful debts rose in 1986 to 187.6 mln rand from 162.1 mln rand in the prior year.     The bank said net income of its Standard Bank of South Africa subsidiary declined 8.2 pct in 1986 to 112.3 mln rand in a difficult banking environment caused mainly by low credit demand.     \n',26
'Standard Chartered Plc STCH.L, faced with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and an ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted its bad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said.     Barber said in a statement on the bank\'s 1986 results that bad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific, stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985.     Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in the specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Tax breaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while 71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision.     In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for 1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Total pre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985.     \"The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, on top of the normal level of provisioning,\" Barber said.     He said, \"the decision was also taken to build up loan loss reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for general provisions for commercial and cross border risks.\"     Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacific region made \"a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits.\"     He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses was \"well maintained, although the reported result was affected by cross border debt provisioning,\" while Californian subsidiary Union Bank \"showed continued growth.\"     \"Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned in excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued,\" he said.     Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off a takeover bid by Lloyds Bank LLOY.L last year, strengthened its capital resources during that year to just over three billion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.     Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primary capital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said.  \n',26
'Standard Trustco said it expects earnings in 1987 to increase at least 15 to 20 pct from the 9,140,000 dlrs, or 2.52 dlrs per share, recorded in 1986.     \"Stable interest rates and a growing economy are expected to provide favorable conditions for further growth in 1987,\" president Brian O\'Malley told shareholders at the annual meeting.     Standard Trustco previously reported assets of 1.28 billion dlrs in 1986, up from 1.10 billion dlrs in 1985. Return on common shareholders\' equity was 18.6 pct last year, up from 15 pct in 1985.  \n',26
'Sulpetro Ltd said its 1986 fiscal year net loss of 276.4 mln dlrs, or 19.22 dlrs per share, was due to several factors, the largest of which was a writedown of 125.0 mln dlrs of oil and gas properties.     Sulpetro also recorded a writeoff of deferred charges amounting to 67.0 mln dlrs, a loss of 22.5 mln dlrs on the disposal of all properties in the United Kingdom and an equity loss of 21.2 mln dlrs from affiliate Sulbath Exploration Ltd.     There was also a loss on other investments of 4.6 mln dlrs and a loss on operations of 36.1 mln dlrs after interest, depletion, depreciation and income tax recoveries.     In the fiscal year ended October 31, 1985, Sulpetro had a net loss of 45.6 mln dlrs, or 3.90 dlrs per share.

'Swire Pacific Ltd SWPC.HKG expects continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees problems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said.     He told reporters:\"1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire Properties expects further good results both from properties under development for sale and from its investment property portfolio.\"     He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78 billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.     Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd CAPH.HKG.     Miles said the company will use the money to develop its business, primarily in Hong Kong.     Swire\'s stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from 70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25 pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the enlarged capital to the state-owned China International Trust and Investment Corp. Cathay last week reported its 1986 profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.     Miles said despite last year\'s rapid expansion in Cathay\'s flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.     He said Cathay\'s growth last year was the result of \"a marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with savings in fuel costs.\"     \"At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable for the rest of this year,\" he said, \"though there might be a bit of increase later this year.\'\'     Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service operations, even though the marine sector is generally depressed. \"Obviously the marine industry is not getting any better,\" he said.     The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year.     Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm but said the firm has no available land for a major housing project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong island now near completion.     He said the company\'s 50 pct unit Hongkong United Dockyard Ltd is negotiating with the government for the development of an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing estate. \"But it\'s not as big as Taikoo Shing,\" he said.  \n',26
'Swire Pacific Ltd SWPC.HKG said it plans for a one-for-five bonus issue for both its \"A\" and \"B\" shares following an earlier report of a 44.7 pct jump in 1986 net profits to 1.78 billion H.K. Dlrs.     The company also announced final dividends of 44 cents per \"A\" share and 8.8 cents per \"B\" share against 32.3 and 6.5 cents a year ago.

'Swire Pacific Ltd SWPC.HKG is likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating profits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in its aviation and property businesses, share analysts said.     Analysts polled bys estimated after-tax profits from operations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs compared with 1.23 billion in 1985.     They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd CAPH.HKG unit last May.     Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985.     Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend for its \"A\" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985.     Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the company\'s net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits, analysts said.     The company\'s aviation division consists of its majority stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd, which is also 25 pct owned by Cathay.     Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel costs and greater traffic.     Swire\'s share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the flotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has since slipped to 50.23 pct.     Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs.     Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd, estimates Swire\'s profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs.     \"Much depends on properties,\" said Measor. \"And they did a lot better in the second half of the year.\"     Estimates of profits from the firm\'s wholly owned Swire Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985.     Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs for the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the same 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm\'s properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential development and two luxury housing projects.     Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in second-half 1986.     During the year property prices continued to rise as more people bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates, analysts said.     \"At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling at 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year ago,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.     Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not provide income until the first stage is completed next year.     The company also sold three properties and a part interest in a proposed hotel development, which should result in extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James Capel (Far East) Ltd.     Swire\'s trading and manufacturing operations are expected to earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10 mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.  \n',26
'Swissair SWSZ.Z reported a 5.8 pct drop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that, in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut its payout to 33 francs per share from 38.     President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would at least equal last year\'s figure, but said much depended on outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate.     The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on Swissair\'s core flying business last year, against a profit of 27 mln francs the previous year, he said.     The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68 mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20 mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s.     Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276 mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation.     Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45 mln francs supplementary depreciation.     Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc.     While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc against other European currencies.     \"Income and profit generated by services to these countries shrank by a very substantial margin,\" he said. \"Exchange rate trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other airlines.\"  \n',26

'Thyssen AG THYH.F said it expects to post a good profit in 1987 despite anticipated losses in its mass steel-making operations this year.     Managing board chairman Dieter Spethmann told the annual meeting the group was satisfied with profit developments in the first half of the 1986/87 financial year to September 30.     The group\'s other three divisions -- specialty steel, capital goods and trading -- had made a profit so far in 1986/87, he added.     Spethmann said income from associate companies had also been good in early 1986/87.     In 1985/86 Thyssen\'s world group profit fell to 370.1 mln marks from 472.4 mln in 1984/85, reflecting costs linked to its steel operations. The company\'s dividend was an unchanged five marks.     A Thyssen spokesman tolds that planned job cuts at subsidiary Thyssen Stahl AG would be higher than announced earlier. Total job losses by 1989 were now expected to total up to 7,800 against original projections of 5,900. Thyssen Stahl employs some 40,000 people.  \n',26

'French oil group Total Cie Francaise des Petroles TPN.PA is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc consolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986, after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, the company said in a communique after a board meeting here.     In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs.     Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total\'s refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France RAFF.PA, told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation.     CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16 billion loss in 1985.     But its net loss last year, taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985.     In 1986 CRD\'s sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from 20.9 mln \"due to the growth in imports by independent distributors following a relaxation of regulations,\" Guilbaud said.     The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000 this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln francs, he said.     Concerning business in 1987, he said that \"January was a good month, but the situation deteriorated in February.\"  \n',26

'Problems in the farmbelt and oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall income for U.S. banks in a quarter century, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) said.     The nation\'s 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8 billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985\'s record 18.1 billion dlrs.     The total was still the second highest ever reported, but it was the first time income had not grown since 1961.     The figures reflected a radical split in the health of banks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.     In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, while one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.     Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDIC said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles it planned to issue.     \"I don\'t remember a time when there was such a clear distinction by geographic area,\" FDIC Chairman William Seidman told reporters.     He said that while the figures were not good, they showed the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but with regional differences in economic performance.     Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as many as failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubted the pace would continue.      On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208 billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in the number of new problem banks in all regions except the Southwest, Seidman said.     Banks\' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from a year ago.     Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDIC said.     Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil\'s moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.     He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be expected.     But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger, Seidman said.  \n',26

'Ultramar Plc UMAR.L said that while its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point of view, several special charges adversely affected results.     Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstream operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and downstream operations also affected in the first half by large losses on inventories.     But margins improved in the second half and in particular refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good recovery.     The company was commenting on results that showed a net loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in 1985.     The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company\'s liquid natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership of Gulf Canada\'s marketing assets.     Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a 13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its U.S. Flag shipping operation.     The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic prices would strengthen over the longer term.     Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.     In the meantime, Ultramar\'s objectives were to improve profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while strengthening core businesses and developing a sound operational and financial base.     Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis.     Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from 181p at last night\'s close.  \n',26
'The flavours and fragrances firm Naarden International N.V., acquired by Anglo-Dutch food and detergents group Unilever Plc N.V.

Naarden said earnings were hit by the fall in the value of both the dollar and sterling, noting the figure was in line with prior expectations. Net profit was 22.0 mln guilders in 1985.     Earnings per share fell to 4.64 guilders from 5.48 in 1985 on turnover of 627.8 mln, down from 662.6 mln.

'Unilever Plc UN.A and NV group reported improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said.     He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years.     Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he noted.     But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic acquisitions taking place \"from time to time,\" he said.     The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.     Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond\'s Inc CBM.N for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution.     However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the company\'s operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.     Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987.     The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with Unilever NV\'s rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc\'s increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with the change in attributable profit.     Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said that there was no target date for completing the process.     He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which operates outside Unilever\'s core activities.     In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business, considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.     However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs of its Surf detergents.  \n',26
'The Unilever Plc and NV UN.A group saw improved performance in almost all sectors during 1986, the Anglo-Dutch group said in its results statement.     Very good progress was made last year, while the recent acquisition of Chesebrough-Pond\'s Inc CBM.N was a significant addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to come.     Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period, making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year.     Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at January 1, 1987.

The parent bank balance sheet rose 89 mln marks to 13.2 billion, while business volume was almost unchanged at 14.8 billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion while loans to companies rose seven pct.     Foreign business and securities trading turnover also increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank\'s own account contributed to record operating profits.     Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1 mln marks to 381.6 mln. Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to 156.7 mln, Luckey said.     Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in West German foreign trade but earnings were still satisfactory.

Despite the fall, Gyllenhammar said, \"Sales of industrial products have never been higher, and Volvo Cars and Volvo Trucks were both completely sold out at year-end.

'AB Catena, in which AB Volvo VOLV.ST has a 48 pct stake, said it was proposing a two-for-five stock issue that will raise the company\'s equity capital to 420 mln crowns from 300 mln.     Catena reported profits after financial income and costs up to only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985, despite an increase in sales to 8.54 billion crowns from 5.59 billion in 1985.     The company said that its 1986 performance was best reflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln from 221 mln in 1985.     Catena\'s increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover of Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business profile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo dealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a trading and industrial company.     In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB. This yielded a profit of 386.7 mln crowns and was reflected in Catena\'s pre-tax earnings which rose to 724 mln crowns from 204 mln in 1985.  \n',26

'Audi AG NSUG.F, the 99 pct owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, said profit in 1986 fell by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record 221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous year.     Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.     He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified amount from 1985\'s record levels.     Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from 9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10 billion this year.     Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi would ensure VW got a share of profits.     Audi\'s entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years VW had received 80 pct of Audi\'s earnings as a dividend.     Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About alleged \"sudden acceleration\" of some of its Audi 5000 models.     As reported, Audi\'s sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct to 59,800 last year.     Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom out in 1987.     Audi\'s worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.     Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000, but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180 in 1985.     Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to 57,000.     Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen compared with 1985\'s 392,000.     Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to further new hiring of employees.     At the end of 1986 Audi\'s workforce stood at a record 39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985.  \n',26
'Dutch dairy and general foods manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV WESS.AS, said it is planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong profit growth over the next 10 years.      Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the presentation of Wessanen\'s 1986 report he already expected 1987 first quarter profits to show an increase.     The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985.     This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar\'s guilder value, van Driel said.     Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985 level of 3.20 guilders.     Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders.     US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover, compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide.     Van Driel said the company would continue an active takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit.     He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China.     He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln guilders and would if necessary make new share issues.     Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln dlrs. He said Balanced Foods and Green\'s Dairy, taken over late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs which was not included in the 1986 account.     All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13 pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to this growth was the successful introduction of new products, which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US acquisitions, van Driel said.     Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986 turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said.     The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich, Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said.     Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles for the company to raise capital for future expansion.     He estimated that 33 pct of the company\'s shares were in foreign hands.     The company\'s 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step, van Driel said without elaborating.     Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which produces around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospects for its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said.  \n',26
'Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale WELG.F said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLB International SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6 mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier.     WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to WestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.     The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record profit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to changed market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of 1987 developed positively, it added.     WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for international credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in 1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.     Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln in 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from 10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that credit business redemptions were not fully offset by new lending.     The statement said WestLB International\'s business with private customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.

'Woodside Petroleum Ltd WPLA.S said its 1986 net loss largely reflected the drop in oil prices combined with a large tax provision.     Woodside earlier reported attributable net loss rose to 17.14 mln dlrs in 1986 from 8.73 mln in 1985, although group revenue rose to 220.84 mln from 173.50 mln.     It said it should have received a 1.7 mln dlr tax credit but instead made a 10.04 mln dlr tax provision. This largely related to its Vamgas Ltd unit, non-allowable exchange losses and tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project not recognised in the accounts.     Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full year sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of the Shelf project, against six month sales in 1985.     Offsetting this was a 23 pct fall in the Cooper Basin gas and liquids revenue of its 50.6 pct-owned Vamgas unit.     Since the balance date Woodside has accepted a Santos Ltd STOS.S takeover offer for Vamgas.     Woodside said a 92.8 mln dlr capital profit on the sale would be included in the 1987 accounts.     It said it lifted capital spending on fixed assets to 269.6 mln dlrs from 178.3 mln, mostly on the Shelf project.  \n',26
'Woolworth Holdings Plc WLUK.L which earlier announced a 1986 pre-tax profits rise of 42 pct over 1985, said its prospects for growth were very exciting.     The profit figure of 115.3 mln stg exceeded a forecast by some 10 pct made during the hostile bid by Dixons Group Plc DXNS.L last year and the company said the results were a major step towards the aim of making Woolworth the most profitable retailing group in the U.K.     It aimed to produce growth from all its businesses and look for opportunities to acquire specialist retail businesses.     Earlier this month the group said that tentative merger talks with the high street pharmacist Underwoods Plc had been called off and recently announced a 19.2 mln stg recommended offer for Charlie Browns Car Part Centres Plc.     The B and Q Do it Yourself centres raised sales by 31 pct and retail profit by 37 pct, with its pretax contribution of 45.5 mln making it the largest single component.     The company said that the improvement had been achieved by substantial organic growth in existing stores as well as by the opening of a further 29 new outlets and enhanced margins.     In other sectors, the Comet electrical chain raised retail profits by 46 pct to 17.4 mln stg, while the Woolworth chain reported a 120 pct improvement to 38.7 mln.     The company said its property operations would increase substantially following the start of a joint venture deal with developers Rosehaugh Plc.     The defence costs against the 1.9 billion stg bid from Dixons resulted in a 16.0 mln stg extraordinary charge.     The results were 10 mln stg up on most analysts forecasts. As a result, the group\'s shares rose strongly, peaking at 865p from last night\'s 842p before easing to 860p at 1155 GMT.  \n',26

'Air Canada\'s 54 mln U.S. dlr acquisition of Gelco Corp\'s GEC Canadian unit has dramatically altered Canada\'s fast growing courier industry, largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company officials and analysts said.     State-owned Air Canada takes over the country\'s second largest overnight courier business just two months after another Canadian company, Onex Capital Corp Ltd, approved the acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp PCC.     But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies and likely don\'t represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations.     \"It\'s a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time,\" McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst Tony Hine commented.     The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S. companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin.     \"There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being under siege or taking someone else over,\" he said.     Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco Express marketing vice president James O\'Neil tolds.     The sale is the first under Gelco\'s divestiture program, and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of debt by year-end, the company said.     While company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures, O\'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs a year.     The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program, adopted after another Canadian Company, Unicorp Canada Corp, acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company.     Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator\'s U.S. courier business.     For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco\'s Canadian courier business represents an \"excellent financial investment\" in a market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman Esther Szynkarsky said.     The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.     It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.     She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada\'s strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business.     Gelco will continue to operate with current management, independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door-to-door courier operation.     \"They\'re well run, they\'re a good investment, they\'re doing well in a growing market, and that\'s the way we want to keep it,\" Szynkarsky said.     Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery network, generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in Canada.     \"The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue,\" Hine said.     \"It\'s sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff through, the more money you make,\" he added.  \n',26

'Dutch chemicals group Akzo NV AKZO.AS said it hoped to consolidate its core activities this year by making small acquisitions in the US.    Akzo chairman Aarnoud Loudon told a news conference on its 1986 report that the company wanted to achieve the same level of US investments it had before it divested its fibre firm American Enka in December 1985, when US investments represented 20 pct of Akzo\'s total capital.    The US expansion plans were not an attempt to compensate for losses in guilder income through the lower dollar, Loudon said.     He said a more important factor was the speed of growth in the US, adding \"It\'s the largest industrial market in the world.\" But he said the company would also be looking at possible acquisitions in Europe.     Despite its highly liquid cash flow, Akzo did not plan acquisitions on a scale that would negatively influence the company\'s debt/equity ratio, Loudon said.    The chairman said in the past two years Akzo had spent 1.1 billion guilders on acquisitions, of which nearly two thirds were in the United States.... \n',26

Alcan NZ last traded at 1.55 NZ dlrs, while Alcan Australia today ended four cents down at 1.15 dlrs.

'Allied-Lyons PLC ALLD.L and Canada\'s Reichmann brothers are working well together as partners and currently do not plan any change in their joint ownership of distiller Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts, Allied-Lyons chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said.     Allied-Lyons got 51 pct control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham last year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs, while the Reichmanns\' Gulf Canada Corp acquired 49 pct in an out-of-court pact after a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of Hiram Walker Resources Ltd.     \"We are getting along very well as partners ... I hope there won\'t be any change, but there could be,\" Holden-Brown told reporters after a speech in Toronto.     He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that could force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons, and Gulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligate Allied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct.     \"Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion for either the put or call to be exercised,\" Holden-Brown said.     In answer to a reporter\'s question, Holden-Brown said it would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49 pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons\' consent. \"I don\'t think we would have any objection to it,\" he added.     Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham\'s board of directors and has total responsibility for its management. \"We cannot contemplate giving up our control,\" he said.     Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profit contribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons\' financial results, but he said \"it will be substantial.\"     \"I am not able to give profit forecasts,\" he said.     Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance the Hiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings, and has no current plans for a stock issue.     He said the company is not currently negotiating any more acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating possible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or food concerns. \"I don\'t think we shall be looking at the brewery scene (which is) highly concentrated already,\" he added.     Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons plans to list its shares on Canadian stock exchanges, possibly later this year.                \n',26
'American Motors Corp AMO management has ordered a hiring freeze in view of Chrysler Corp\'s C 1.5 billion dlr takeover bid, a spokesman for AMC said.     Analysts said the merger is virtually certain to go ahead.     American Motors directors met for five hours Wednesday to review the takeover proposal. \"The board ... Expects to be meeting periodically over the next several weeks on the Chrysler proposal,\" AMC said in its first formal statement since it acknowledged the Chrysler proposal on Monday.     Chrysler, the number three U.S. Automaker, has said the merger is motivated principally by its desire to acquire AMC\'s profitable Jeep business and dealers, as well as a new modern car assembly plant in Bramalea, Ontario.     That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC, but it leaves in question the fate of many of its 19,000-plus employees, according to industry analysts.

'Belgian starch manufacturer Amylum NV is surprised and disappointed that its 675 mln dlr offer for the European business of CPC International Inc CPC.N was apparently rejected in favour of a lower 630 mln dlr bid by Italy\'s Gruppo Ferruzzi, chairman Pierre Callebaut said.     Callebaut tolds that Amylum, a leading starch and isoglucose manufacturer in which Britain\'s Tate and Lyle Plc TATL.L holds a 33.3 pct stake, had made an undisclosed initial takeover offer for CPC\'s European corn wet milling business by the close of CPC\'s tender on March 17.     The offer was raised on March 24 to a final 675 mln dlrs in cash after CPC told Amylum its initial bid was below Ferruzzi\'s 630 mln stg offer, Callebaut said.     On the same day, CPC announced it had agreed in principle to sell its European business to Ferruzzi in a 630 mln dlr deal.     Noting that Ferruzzi was studying a public offering of shares in its unit European Sugar (France) to fund the CPC takeover, Callebaut said Amylum may still succeed in its bid.     \"For the time being we just await developments. But I note that whereas our higher offer was in cash, Ferruzzi apparently is still organising finance,\" Callebaut said.  \n',26
'CSR Ltd CSRA.S has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share analysts said.     \"It sounds like a good deal,\" Stuart McKibbin of A.C. Goode and Co tolds.     CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead sell it to Exxon Corp XON unit Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs.     In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia\'s largest sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.     \"This will be a big shock to the market, which was under the impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,\" McKibbin said.     A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had given itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.     CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years.     Delhi is one of Australia\'s largest onshore oil producers yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin. Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs.     Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker Bain and Co Ltd said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of Australian-owned assets to a foreign company.     \"The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold back to the Americans,\" Goldston-Morris said.     The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the largest player in Australia\'s 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country, analysts said.     They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.     Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said.     Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging investment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company\'s overall performance, analysts said.     CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely from U.S. Dollar debt, they said.     \"It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely with debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oil price collapsed on them,\" Owen Evans of Sydney broker Meares and Philips Ltd said.     Esso not only picked up Delhi\'s oil and gas output but also gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions.     Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50 Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd BRKN.S.     \"Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland Basin. They haven\'t found too much oil in Bass Strait lately and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,\" Goldston-Morris said.  \n',26

'Ariadne group unit Barwon Farmlands Ltd confirmed it offered 3.8 billion pesos in cash for the 38 mln shares of Philippine brewing company San Miguel Corp.     The Australia-based Barwon, 30 pct owned by New Zealander Bruce Judge\'s Ariadne group, said in a statement released in Hong Kong that a formal offer had been made to the Philippines government, which holds the shares.     It said it was confident the offer will be reviewed favourably.     Newspapers in Manila and Hong Kong reported at the weekend that an offer had been made.     Barwon said it was represented by Australian stockbroker Jacksons Ltd, which forwarded a formal offer to Philippine President Corazon Aquino of 100 pesos for each of the 38.1 mln A and B shares of San Miguel.     The Philippine government seized the shares, which represent a 31 pct stake in the brewery firm, from the United Coconut Planters Bank, alleged by the government to be linked with the country\'s deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.     The Barwon statement said a deal is expected to be concluded between Barwon and the Philippines government in 14 days.     Barwon also said it made recommendations to the government on how it could purchase the class A shares, which can only be held by a Philippine national or a firm which is at least 60 pct held by a member of the country. It did not elaborate.     The Hong Kong Economical Journal quoted a spokesman of Jacksons as saying Barwon plans to set up a branch in the Philippines to meet the criteria.

'American Telephone and Telegraph Co and Philips Telecommunications BV (APT) would hold 36 pct through direct and indirect holdings in France\'s Cie Generale de Constructions Telephoniques if a joint bid with French partners for the soon-to-be-privatised firm succeeds, a director at one of the partner firms said.     Marc Mathieu of Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications SAT, told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pct for APT, the joint firm set up by the U.S.\'s ATT T.N. and the NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken PGLO.AS.     The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company made up of SAT, APT, Cie du Midi MCDP.PA and five mutual funds.    Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20 pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost their stake to 40 pct through indirect holdings.     The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject to close discussions within the government due to legal queries over the nationality of the mutual funds, a Finance Ministry official said.     Although bought by French citizens they are managed by foreign banks Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York and Banque de Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet SA, controlled by Algemene Bank Nederland NV ABNN.AS, an SAT spokesman said.     CGCT, which controls 16 pct of the French public telephone switching market, is to be sold by the government for 500 mln francs by private tender.     Five groups are bidding for the company and the government has said it will choose CGCT\'s new owner by the end of April.     APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference a capital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT, but declined to give details or say how an increase would affect foreign stakes in CGCT.     In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales of three billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs.     A joint SAT-APT statement added that buyers were committed to investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and production plants. The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT to produce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it to French standards.     The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement for ATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introduction of the French government privatisation laws which reopened bidding among a wider range of applicants.     Other candidacies to take over CGCT include West Germany\'s Siemens AG SIEG.F allied with Schneider SA SCHN.PA subsidiary Jeumont-Schneider, Sweden\'s Telefon AB LM Ericsson ERIC.ST allied with Matra MATR.PA and Bouygues SA BOUY.PA, Italy\'s Italtel, and Canada\'s Northern Telecom Ltd NTL.TO.  \n',26

The AGL offer, the third to be made for TMOC this year, compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share.

This compares with the Santos stake of 3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23.     Elders Resources Ltd began the auction for TMOC about three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share on-market offer that has since lapsed.     AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of values placed on TMOC by its advisers in the company\'s response urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid.     AGL said it will make the same offer for TMOC\'s convertible notes. Accepting share and note holders will participate in AGL\'s planned one-for-one bonus issue.     It said TMOC is already a partner with AGL in the Alice Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses complementary with those of AGL.     AGL is the New South Wales natural gas utility while TMOC has extensive onshore holdings, mainly in Queensland where it owns the Moonie oil field and in the Northern Territory where it operates and holds 43.75 of the Mereenie oil-gas field. It also has interests in a number of gas or oil pipelines.  \n',26
'Diversified investment company, Ariadne Australia Ltd, has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln shares in the Philippine brewing firm San Miguel, a Manila newspaper reported.     The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne\'s chairman, New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct of the nation\'s yearly budget to buy the shares from the government.     The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in Manila were not available for comment on the report.     The shares are the entire block seized by the government from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion that the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman of San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos.     The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14 mln class B shares.     Government officials have said earlier that the more valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners.     The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might buy eight mln class A shares last week.     \"Judge\'s offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the Philippines\' yearly budget,\" Ariadne\'s Philippine agent Domingo Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.     \"Mr Judge\'s objective in this investment is to make his corporation\'s management expertise available to San Miguel so that the company\'s assets can be fully utilised.\"     San Miguel, the country\'s largest brewer, is also one of the major manufacturers of grocery lines.     Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tap food and liquor distribution lines in Australia, Britain, the U.S., New Zealand and Hong Kong through Barwon Farmlands Ltd, a listed Australian firm in which it has 30 pct equity.     Ariadne, with about one billion dlrs in assets and turnover of about two billion, has interests also in mining, real estate and agricultural products.  \n',26
'The Australia based Ariadne Australia Ltd, plans to set up a branch in the Philippines to fulfill a prerequisite for the takeover of the Philippine brewing firm, San Miguel Corp, a Hong Kong newspaper said.     The Hong Kong Economic Journal quoted a spokesman of Australian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that Barwon Farmlands Ltd, a listed Australian firm of which Ariadne owns a 30 pct stake, is planning a branch in the Philippines.     He added Jacksons is arranging an offer by Barwon to pay a total 3.8 billion pesos in cash for 38 mln San Miguel shares.     Barwon is offering 100 pesos each for 24 mln class A San Miguel shares and 14 mln class B stock. But the Jacksons spokesman noted that the more valuable A stock would only be sold to Filipinos or companies registered in the Philippines.     He said Barwon has approached the Philippine government which seized the block of shares from the United Coconut Planters Bank, which is believed to be linked with the country\'s deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.     He added he expects a deal to be concluded between Barwon and the Philippine Government in 14 days as it is the only offer in cash, the newspaper reported.     Hong Kong Economic Journal also noted stock market rumours that Neptunia Corp, a Hong Kong registered company which controlled by San Miguel\'s president Andres Soriano, is the other party keen on the block of San Miguel shares.     The Philippine\'s Commission on Good Government ruled last May against a move of Neptunia to acquire 33 mln San Miguel shares controlled by the brewery firm\'s former chairman Eduardo Cojuangco, who is also chairman of United Coconut.     Commissioner Ramon Diaz said at the time the government would not allow a subsidiary to buy into a parent firm, adding San Miguel could have offered the shares to other parties.     The Manila newspaper Sunday Times published a letter sent yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne\'s chairman, New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct of the nation\'s yearly budget to buy the shares from the government.     \"Judge\'s offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the Philippines\' yearly budget,\" Ariadne\'s Philippine agent Domingo Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.     Spokesmen of Ariadne, Jacksons and Neptunia were not available for comment, nor any officials of the Philippines.     San Miguel Brewery Ltd, a Hong Kong listed company which is 69.65 pct held by Neptunia on behalf of San Miguel Corp, closed 40 cents higher at 15.50 H.K. Dlrs on Friday.  \n',26

'Avia Group International Inc  stockholders filed a class a action suit in Multnomah County Circuit court seeking to halt the sale of Avia to Reebok International Ltd RBOK.     Avia stockholders also seek to receive compensation from the defendants, who include most of Avia directors, according to court papers.     The suit grew out a meeting of several dozen dissatisfied minority stockholders of Avia following the announcement of Reebok\'s proposed acquisition of Avia and the sudden drop in the price of Avia stock.     The complaint was filed on behalf of Clem Eischen, a Portland-area resident, who owns 500 shares of Avia, and Robert Withers, also of the Portland-area, who owns 954 shares, and other individuals who held stock at the time of Reebok\'s announcement. A jury trial has been requested.     \"The actions of the small group that contral Avia have hurt the little guy,\" said Eischen.     The stockholders, according to a statement, have organized a steering committee.     The complaint reviews the price action of Avia stock from March 1986 and noted the plaintifs who purchased stock between 19 dlrs and 25 dlrs per share. The price fell from 24 dlrs to 16.50 dlrs a share following the Reebok announcement.     The complaint asked the defendants be enjoined from proceeding with the Reebok acquisition of Avia. It also requests damages to be determined at the time of trial.     Avia said it had not seen the court papers and said it had no comment on the suit.  \n',26

'Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturer for national security reasons, U.S. officials said.     The officials, who asked not to be named, said yesterday that Baldrige has \"serious concerns\" about the sale of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. to Fujitsu Ltd., another major electronics firm.     The officials tolds that if the sale went through it could leave the U.S. military overly dependent on a foreign /ompany for vital high technology equipment used in its advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence gathering.     In addition, they said, the sale would also worsen the already strained trade relations between the U.S. and Japan stemming from the huge Japanese surplus.     The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the sale in the coming weeks, they said.     Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger\'s position was not immediately known but in the past he has opposed the transfer of high technology to foreign governments and companies.     Supercomputers made by Fairchild and other U.S. manufacturers are widely used throughout the world, but none have been sold to the Japanese government or to Japanese government-run agencies and universities.  \n',26

'French sugar group Beghin-Say, which is 49.6 pct owned by Italy\'s Gruppo Ferruzzi, is to raise its capital to 703 mln francs from 527 mln through a three-for-one issue of shares and investment certificates to finance expansion, president Jean-Marc Vernes told analysts.     For the first stage Beghin-Say will issue some 2.05 mln new 65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln francs. The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658,000 new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400 francs, raising capital to 703 mln francs.     The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2 billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans. These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France, Vernes said.     Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of Corn Products\' installations in Europe. Apart from the French plant, these include three factories in each of Italy and West Germany, two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands and Denmark.     Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the installations, and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs, Vernes said.     If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and developing two other French plants, either in the maize or wheat starch sector.     Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion for its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for its capital increase.     Kaysersberg, which was transformed from a division of Beghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year, has been holding talks with other European companies on possible accords, Vernes said. He added the company could be introduced onto the Paris Bourse in the near future.  \n',26
'Belgian Budget Minister Guy Verhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in several state-owned enterprises, including national airline Sabena and the postal and telecommunications authority, government sources said.     They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francs in revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadt\'s projections, helping the government to reduce its huge budget deficit, targetted this year at 418 billion francs.     But the scheme had received a guarded reception from the Social Christian parties in Belgium\'s centre-right coalition when Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday.     Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult, the sources said.     Verhofstadt proposes beginning the selloffs in the last quarter of 1987, with the sale of 30 to 40 pct of state investment company SNI. He expects the sale to raise three billion francs, they added.     A 25 pct share in Sabena would be sold in mid-1989 for 1.5 billion francs, while 50 pct of the postal and telecommunications authority would be sold off in two stages in mid-1990 and early 1992, raising at least seven billion francs.     Also on Verhofstadt\'s list are the Maritime Transport Authority, leading gas distributor Distrigaz, CGER savings bank, CGER, and several other credit institutions.     Le Soir daily quoted CGER vice-president Paul Henrion as expressing strong opposition to the privatisation of his bank.     \"Public company we are and public company we wish to stay,\" Henrion told the paper.  \n',26
'A Belgian finance ministry spokesman said new rules planned on insider trading would enable offenders to be fined and imprisoned for up to a year, and be compelled to forfeit gains.     The new rules require parliamentary approval, and government sources said it was unclear when they would come into force. Insider trading is currently not an offence in this country.     The cabinet approved a separate bill that analysts said includes provisions to make more difficult the build-up of major new stakes in Belgian companies.     The bill would make obligatory the declaration of major stakes in companies quoted on the bourse with own resources of more than 200 mln francs.     The Minister for Economic Affairs would need to be informed in advance of deals under which foreign interests planned to buy a new stake of more than ten pct of the voting shares in a large Belgian company, or to increase an existing stake to more than 20 pct.  \n',26

'Bond Corp International Ltd, a subsidiary of the Australian-based Bond Corp Holdings Ltd BONA.S, said it would defer its planned rights issue but still wants the issue to be made before July 31.     No date has been set for the issue, announced in January.     In a document to shareholders, Bond Corp said the delay follows its receipt of a 240 mln H.K. Dlr loan from its parent company to meet the first payment on the newly acquired Bond Centre commercial complex in central Hong Kong.     It also wants outside partners to take up to 50 pct in the project, the company said.     The January announcement said the rights issue would finance Bond Corp\'s 1.4 billion dlr acquisition of a 23.77 pct stake in HK-TVB Ltd TVBH.HK from film magnate Run Run Shaw.     The company then reached an agreement with a consortium led by Sino Land Co Ltd SINO.HK to buy a commercial complex that is still under construction for 1.9 billion dlrs.     Bond International said in the document that except for the 240 mln dlr loan, the deal would be financed from internal resources and by selling an interest in the building.     The payments must be completed by the end of 1987.     Bond International has also sold several residential buildings in Hong Kong\'s mid-levels district for a total of 68.35 mln dlrs, the statement said.     The flats were among the properties it bought last year from Hongkong Land Co Ltd HKLD.HK for 1.4 billion dlrs.

'British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L said it intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co SRD.N it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.     The offer would be made through its BP North America Inc unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares being tendered.     BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based on its own valuation as well as those of its financial advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and non-public information.     Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down 1-3/4 dlrs.     BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at last night\'s close.     About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP\'s own resources.     The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The company said it was in the course of arranging these facilities.     BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group\'s investment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be made without the limitations of a minority interest.     BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the investment.     Walters added that it also felt that, due to management changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even in a lower oil price environment.     Standard\'s net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.     Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise. One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group should spend so much money buying a company it already controlled.     BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.     It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on the U.K. Government\'s recent announcement that it intended to dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the 1987/88 financial year, analysts said.     Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would depend on the reaction of the markets.     The deal would probably push BP\'s gearing up to around 59 pct from 20 pct currently, he said.     However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not repeat last year\'s rapid drop the prospects for Standard returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from its cash flow -- were good.     Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.     Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from production and its downstream activities would push it comfortably into surplus.     BP initially took a stake in Standard following the discovery of oil in Alaska\'s Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard, which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude oil.     The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management reorganisation of Standard in the past year.     The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the tender offer, Spedding said.     BP\'s willingness to take hard decisions such as major balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well received in the markets.     The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by other sectors.  \n',26
'BP International and BP North America are seeking a five billion dlr, four year syndicated credit facility in support of British Petroleum Co Plc\'s tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already own, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York said as arranger.     The facility, to be guaranteed by British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L is probably the largest credit facility ever arranged in Europe, bond analysts said. Full terms will be announced either later today or tomorrow morning. BP said earlier it planned a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own for 70 dlrs a share cash.     The financing being arranged by Morgan Guaranty will take the form of a fully committed revolving credit. As announced earlier, BP also is arranging a U.S. Commercial paper program in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be used to support that program.     The exact size of the U.S. Program has not been decided and the dealers have not yet been chosen.     The credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue cash advances with maturities of one, three or six months through a tender panel, which will be comprised of banks committed to the facility.     Despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility, Morgan Guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among BP\'s relationship banks.     As a result, banks were being offered lead manager status at 200 mln dlrs, co-lead management at 125 mln and manager at 75 mln.

Formal documents will be sent to shareholders as soon as possible, it said in a brief statement.     BTR Nylex, which manufactures rubber and plastic products, first bid for BWA in late January.     As previously reported, Borg-Warner Corp, which owns 65 pct of BWA\'s ordinary shares and 100 pct of the preferences, advised a month ago that it would not accept the offer.     This meant BTR Nylex\'s 50.1 pct acceptance condition could not be met, BWA said in a statement reporting its parent\'s decision.     BWA advised shareholders to ignore the offer and said other parties had expressed interest in bidding for it.     But no other bid has yet emerged.

'A Japanese businessman announced plans for a new telecommunications firm in which Britain\'s Cable and Wireless Plc would be a core company.     However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation of Economic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does not specify what stake Cable and Wireless would have.     \"The share holdings of the core companies should be equal,\" Watanabe said in a statement. \"The actual percentage of shareholdings should be agreed by the core companies.\"     He said the eight core companies will provide directors for the firm.     \"The new company shall immediately set to work on the feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself,\" Watanabe said.     Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups, one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now monopolizes Japan\'s overseas telephone business.     The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wants only one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe\'s efforts.     A British source, who declined to be identified further, said the proposals could open the door to further talks between C and W CAWL.L and the other firms involved.     C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which would have given it a five pct share in the new telecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pct stake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stake in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge.     The British source said the decision not to specify the exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door open for further discussion.     \"It\'s probably a sensible approach on their part,\" the British source tolds.     C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a new cable between Japan and the U.S.     The proposed merger has sparked an international row, with British government sources threatening retaliatory action against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices against foreign firms.     The sources said last Friday that one option for Britain would be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London.     The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans, saying that both rival consortia should be licensed.     Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms, Watanabe said, \"They will not be core companies but if they wish they could participate.\" Under the Japanese law, total foreign participation would be limited to one-third.     \"It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which has the support of many influential backers and work within this for the realization of their ideas,\" Watanabe told reporters.     The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp MITT.T, Mitsui and Co MITS.T, Sumitomo Corp SUMT.T, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co MC.T, Toyota Motor Corp TOYO.T, C Itoh and Co CITT.T, and Pacific Telesis International Inc.

If it fails to satisfy the British government, it will be up to the Japanese government to explain its position, he said.  \n',26

'Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L said proposals to resolve a dispute over entry to Japan\'s telecommunications market were not acceptable.     A company spokesman said the proposals appear to have been made in today\'s edition of the Japanese daily Asahi by Fumio Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with the Federation of Economic Organisations.     However, the suggestion still recommended a merger between the two consortia tendering for contracts and would give Cable a five pct stake, more than the three pct originally proposed but less than the 20 pct it holds in its original venture, he said.     The proposal would also offer a Cable nominee a seat on the board of the merged company.     The spokesman said he believed Japan should accept applications from the two rivals for fair review.     Earlier today Cable shares firmed on market speculation that the dispute -- which is being treated by Britain\'s government as a test case of how open the Japanese telecommunications market is -- was near settlement.     Cable shares at 1350 GMT were quoted at 375p compared with a close last night at 364p.  \n',26
'Shares in Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L firmed in morning trading on market speculation that its participation in a joint telecommunications venture in Japan would not be curtailed, dealers said.     The company\'s shares were quoted at 372p at 0915 GMT compared with 364p last night.     The dealers said the speculation appeared to originate in Japan. Cable has said it is resisting attempts by the Federation of Economic Organisations to merge two Japan-based telecommunications firms, a move which would have cut Cable\'s stake from 20 pct in one to three pct in the merged unit.     However, the dealers were uncertain exactly how the dispute over the shareholdings had been resolved.     British prime minister MargaretThatcher said in parliament last week that she regarded Cable and Wireless\'s participation in the Japanese venture as a test case of how open the Japanese telecommunications market really was.     A spokesman for Cable said he was unaware if the speculation had any foundation. Cable itself had issued no statement today on the issue.  \n',26
'Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L said new proposals unveiled by Japan for it to become a core member of a merged telecommunications firm to compete for telecommunications contracts did not remove the group\'s objections.     The suggestions by Federation of Economic Organisations official Fumio Watanabe was a formal announcement of proposals made earlier this week and reported in the Japanese press.     Cable has a 20 pct stake in one of the two groups trying to compete against Japan\'s Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd which monopolises Japan\'s overseas telephone business.     But a Cable spokesman said it still believed a merger of the two consortia would be impracticable. \"They are like oil and water,\" he said.     The Japanese authorities want only one competitor and have proposed that the two consortia band together. The issue has been taken up by the British government as a test case on the openness of Japanese markets. Watanabe\'s latest proposals said that the eight core companies of the new group should have equal share holdings but added that they could work out the precise percentages amongst themselves.     The reports earlier this week said that Cable would be offered a five pct stake, up from an originally proposed three pct.     Despite the apparent differences in stakes offered, the Cable spokesman said the two offers appeared to be essentially the same.     Cable shares at 1100 GMT were quoted nine pence firmer at 374p.  \n',26

'Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the government was considering selling Petro-Canada and the sale would proceed if it were in the national interest to do so.     Mulroney told the House of Commons assets of the huge oil company would be examined before a decision was made, just as other state-run companies were studied before being sold under Ottawa\'s privatization program.     \"The government is going to examine assets of this nature to ascertain if they continue to play an appropriate role in public policy and we will make a determination as we have in other cases,\" Mulroney told the daily question period.

'San Miguel Corp, SMC, and United Coconut Planters Bank, UCPB, have reached a compromise on a disputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of a government panel that controls the sequestered shares said.     Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) tolds SMC had offered a price of 126 pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB.     \"It looks good,\" Diaz said. But he added several issues, including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares, had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the sale.     The PCGG\'s sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted SMC\'s bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos.     Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when he fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24 mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration.     \"The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers,\" Diaz said. \"Naturally we do not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies.\"     PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC\'s Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year.     The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos.     PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines\' largest food and beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln \"B\" class shares from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a price of 150 pesos per share.     The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500 mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred shares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to UCPB-controlled trading companies.     The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share made by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend declared in June last year.     A spokesman for SMC said the company\'s 15-member board met today to discuss the proposed compromise.     The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration.     President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15.     Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMC board, filed a formal complaint before the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight other directors of violating \"fiduciary duty.\"     De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC\'s board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan.  \n',26

'A U.S. Appeals court last night blocked the 860 mln dlr merger of Delta Airlines Inc DAL.N and Western Airlines just hours before it was to go into effect because of a dispute over union representation.     The ruling came in a lawsuit in which the Air Transport Employees union said Western\'s management should fulfil a promise to honour union contracts if a merger took place.     The airlines argued that Western\'s promise could not be enforced in a takeover by a larger company. Airlines officials could not be reached for comment on the ruling, which halts the merger until arbitration on the dispute is completed.  \n',26

'CSR Ltd CSRA.S said it will offer 2.20 dlrs cash each for the shares it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.     CSR already holds 31.74 pct of Pioneer\'s 99.80 mln issued shares, it said in a statement.     The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar share capital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today\'s closing market level of 1.85 dlrs a share.     CSR said it will announce further details of the offer soon, including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer Sugar stock.     It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer Sugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer\'s net earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over yesterday\'s market price which CSR said it believed already contained an element of takeover speculation.     It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer\'s last reported net tangible assets per share, CSR said.     CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings which will flow from integrated management of CSR\'s and Pioneer\'s raw sugar mills and building materials businesses.     These economies can only be achieved through CSR control and management of Pioneer Sugar, it added.     The takeover announcement came soon after CSR\'s earlier reported statement that it will sell its Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd unit to an Exxon Corp XON unit for 985 mln dlrs and not proceed with the previously announced float of part of Delhi.  \n',26

The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint statement.     The previously announced float of part of its Delhi interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement.     Delhi Australia Fund owns Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd, which holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd STOS.S-led Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.     In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi\'s interests in the next two years, the statement said.     \"The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float,\" CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.     Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership.     With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier, he said.     As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd that it does not already hold, valuing its entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.  \n',26

'Dart Group DARTA is likely seeking to buy Supermarkets General SGL, analysts said.     \"There\'s been rumors that they\'ve taken a position in the company, said Wood Gundie analyst Edward Comeau.     Last year, Dart Group, owner of Auto Trak INc and Crown Books, competed against Kohlberg, Kravis to acquire Safeway Stores INc.     The company later reached an accord under which it would buy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed its leveraged buyout of the company.     The company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mln to 200 mln dlrs, according to analysts.      Dart Group Corp was not immediately available for comment.     Jerry Ballan, analyst with Conner Ballan division of Edward Viner and Co, said, \"They Dart has been rumored to be buying some other supermarkets as well, such as Stop and Shop.\"     \"My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to be bought out,\" said Ballan.     Analysts, however, said Supermarkets General is facing problems due to its Purity Supreme and Rickels operations, which might make it difficult to thwart a bid.     Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a post stock split basis.     For the first quarter, Comeau predicts the company will earn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago, and should earn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987.     \"But that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily, due to Purity Supreme in New England,\" Comeau said.     He said competition among supermarkets is getting heated in that area and that the company has had difficulty with integrating Purity Supreme with its Pathmark store operations.     Rickels, a home center business, has faced problems due to the state of that industry, and has reported lower returns as an operating unit, according to analysts.     Analysts said that if Dart buys Supermarkets General it would probably divest the company\'s operations.     Analyst Comeau said \"supermarkets general may seek a combination with another supermarket company.\" \n',26

'Deutsche Bank AG DBKG.F has agreed to take over the outstanding 25 pct in Deutsche Bank (Asia) AG, the former European Asian Bank AG, from Creditanstalt-Bankverein CABV.VI, Deutsche management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen told a news conference.     Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from Deutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal with Creditanstalt.     Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of Lloyds Bank plc LLOY.L were without foundation, he said.     Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recent capital increase of Morgan Grenfell Group plc, but had no plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell.     Banca d\'America e d\'Italia SpA, in which 98.3 pct was acquired from Bankamerica Corp BAC.N late last year, would be consolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion of Deutsche\'s business, management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said.     Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High Court, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the balance sheet section \"participations,\" Christians said.     But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in these non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active participation.     Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.     Herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in a separate holding company.  \n',26
'Dixons Group Plc DXNS.L said its tender offer for all of the common shares in Cyclops Corp of the U.S. Expired at midnight yesterday and that it had accepted approximately 2.3 mln shares in the company at 90.25 dlrs each.     This represents just over 54 pct of the outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis. But including shares already owned, Dixons now holds a total of 56 pct of the fully diluted outstanding shares.     The company said it is now entitled to subscribe for all the authorised but unissued and unreserved shares of common stock of Cyclops, which total some 5.4 mln shares, at 90.25 dlrs each.     Dixons said it has waived its condition that 80 pct of the fully diluted outstanding shares be validly tendered and not withdrawn.     Dixons launched the agreed 384 mln dlr offer on February 17 this year in the wake of its unsuccessful battle to take over the U.K. Retail store chain Woolworth Holdings Plc WLUK.L.     Dixons shares were last quoted at 390p, up on last night\'s close of 380p.

'Dixons Group PLC said it received a letter on March 19 from Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd, part of the Cyacq investor group making a rival bid for Cyclops Corp CYL, proposing to drop the group\'s offer if Dixons would sell Cyclops industrial businesses to Citicorp.     \"Cyacq\'s main equity investor appears ready to pull out and deal directly with us for merely part of the company\" said Dixons. \"It raises questions as to the strength of their consortium and the purpose of their offer.\"     Dixons also said a U.S. Federal Court had refused a request by counsel for Cyacq, Audio/Video Affiliates Inc AVA and a shareholder plaintiff to prevent Dixons from completing its tender offer for Cyclops. It also said the court refused to require Cyclops to provide Cyacq with confidential information previously provided to Dixons.     On Friday Cyacq Corp, an investor group led by Audio/Video Affiliates and Citicorp, raised their offer for Cyclops to 92.50 dlrs per share from 80 dlrs per share, if certain conditions were satisfied.

'More U.S. And European firms will be falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to merger and acquisitions specialists polled bys.     Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S. Banks, steel and other businesses.     In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd ITSU.T -- Japan\'s biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for Fairchild Semiconductor Corp, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers.     Nomura Securities Co Ltd NMSC.T and Daiwa Securities Co Ltd DSEC.T, Japan\'s two largest brokerage firms, are seeking a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the country\'s huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking, the takeover specialists said.     Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists.     Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore.     \"The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. -- Japan\'s largest market and where political risks are minimal,\" a takeover specialist at one trading company said.     Japanese companies have become among the world\'s richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months.     But the yen\'s strength, which has also raised the costs of Japan\'s exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth, the specialists said.     Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against Japanese exports.     Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work. Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little investment opportunity.     \"Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but the recent economic factors have become a driving force,\" said a banking industry source.     So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious.     While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said.     Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now, but that time span appeared now to be too long.     Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said.     A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc\'s DIAC.T takeover bid for Sun Chemical Corp of the U.S. Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he added.     Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical\'s graphic arts group for 550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts-related businesses.     Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese, the trading company official says. \"Japanese people don\'t like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable deals.\" But now after some experience overseas, Japanese companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. \"This is a healthy progression.\"     However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.     \"Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large U.S. Or European corporation,\" one banker said. \"They will expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for Japanese business.\"     A foreign merchant banker also noted, \"There are not many mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big deals there have already been done.\"     But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of Japanese companies, the specialists said.     Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high-technology areas. \"Japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend,\" one takeover specialist said.     Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said.     But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.  \n',26

'Exco International Plc, a subsidiary of British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc BCOM.L, said it had agreed in principle to buy an 80 pct stake in RMJ Holdings Corp for about 79 mln dlrs.     Exco Chairman Richard Lacy tolds the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc BK.N, which currently holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder.     Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years.     RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the largest U.S. Government securities brokers.     It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies.     Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S. Government securities broker for the past four years and had made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp SPC.N in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs.     B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net income of around 16 mln dlrs.     The company\'s earnings had not been hit by the halving of brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled.     Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in the brokerage business and about 70 in its SMS unit, which provided computer software for the financial services community.     RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a day, and in London where it has 15 billion.     It was also given permission last week to open an office in Tokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to about five billion dlrs a day.     The acquisition would contribute between five and 10 pct of B and C\'s share earnings in 1987 on a proforma basis.  \n',26
'Schlumberger Ltd\'s SLB.N decision to end an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd ITSU.T to buy 80 pct of its Fairchild Semiconductor Corp, and the political furore that surrounded the proposed sale, will make Japanese companies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. High technology firms but will not halt such attempts, industry analysts said.     The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to Fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S. Expansion by the Japanese firm, said analysts polled bys.     \"The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu\'s North American operations, but it would have been a great boost,\" James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said.     French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending the agreement because mounting political controversy in the U.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake could be completed in a reasonable time.     The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and Defence Department, partly on national security grounds.     Fujitsu\'s acquisition of Fairchild would have given the Japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North American sales and distribution system and access to microprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak, analysts said.     The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional microchip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in the U.S., A report by the Capel firm said.     \"It was an entry point, a port for semiconductors and a marketing channel for other things,\" said Barclays de Zoete Wedd analyst Rick May.     Several analysts said the purchase would not have given Fujitsu access to critical defence technology.     \"(Fairchild) simply doesn\'t have key technology -- that\'s a thing of the past,\" May said.     The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to modernise Fairchild\'s production lines, Capel\'s Murtha said.     The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese firms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. High tech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said.     Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly route of expanding its own production and distribution facilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use the estimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to acquire some less politically symbolic firm.     \"It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but the necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in America remains,\" said Capel\'s Murtha. \"The Japanese will continue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to find ones that are politically acceptable.\"     Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash that blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said. \"They\'re not going to slow up, they\'re just going to buy smaller pieces ... Because of the political risk,\" said Barclays de Zoete\'s May.     Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct shares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as super minicomputer makers, he said.     Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up harming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational tie-ups, some analysts said.     \"This is not really of benefit to U.S. Firms either,\" said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. \"The pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move -- why should the government step in to prevent it?\"     Japan\'s Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime Tamura told a press conference that interference by U.S. Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate.     \"This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter for governments\' comment,\" Tamura said. \"I think it was improper for U.S. Government officials to intervene to the extent they did,\" he said.     A spokesman tolds the ministry\'s view is that international investment flows ought to be free and that such flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing closeness of U.S.-Japanese economic ties.  \n',26
'Fairchild Semiconductor Corp president Donald Brooks said he intends to take a management buyout proposal to the company\'s parent at some point in the future and substantial funding is available for such a purchase.     Fairchild is owned by Schlumberger Ltd SLB.     Brooks also told a press conference that if management is successful, it may later attempt to take the company public.     \"I am sure that if such a management buyout is to occur, and I am hopeful that it does, the public market is one of the avenues we will ultimately have to use to raise capital,\" Brooks said.     Brooks also said the company would continue to attempt an exchange of technology and manufacturing agreement with Fujitsu Ltd if successful in its buyout bid.     Futjitsu withdrew an offer to acquire some 80 pct of Fairchild, a semiconductor maker, after U.S. government officials expressed opposition to the transaction.     Brooks told the news conference that any purchase would be in the form of a management buyout and not a leveraged buyout.     He also said the transaction could be financed through a debt issue or conventional financing from investors.     Brooks said management is pleased by a number of investment proposals bought to them, but he added, \"the investors must be willing to invest in the future growth of the company and not just selling off assets.\"     Brooks also said he was not aware of any direct intervention by the U.S. in an attempt to block the merger.     \"I am not aware of any direct contact between Washington and Fujitsu, but that doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t exist,\" Brooks said.     He also said Fujitsu executives remain enthusiastic about a link with Fairchild.  \n',26
'Federal Reserve Board Governor Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by permitting formation of financial services holding companies involved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate and securities.     In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank and Financial Analysts\' Association, Heller said, \"I believe that increased diversification along geographic and product lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system.\"     He said he supported the idea of financial services holding companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding Companies in which regulation of various bank, thrift, insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries would be handled on functional lines.     \"Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the bank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would have to be on an arms-length basis,\" Heller said.     Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks\' special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.     Heller said he \"would require the holding company to serve as a \'source of strength\' to the bank by making a commitment to maintain the bank\'s capital.     \"In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as long as the holding company has a positive net worth.\"     Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted to own a financial services holding company, again with the provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise if necessary.     Heller said the effects of these actions \"would be banks that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them\" in which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to \"loot the bank\" was removed.     Such diversification would give access to national and international financial services to corporations across the United States.     Heller said that would mean \"the steady decline of America\'s banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested\" by permitting them to become more competitive.  \n',26
'The Ferruzzi Group\'s holding company Agricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under the agreement reached in principle between the two companies, a statement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said.     When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, it said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs.     Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations.     It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories employing about 5,000 people in eight European Community countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC states.     The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of 1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or about one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of cereals.     Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both geographically and in terms of products.     It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar and of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader.     It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum quotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and said it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in the future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel.     Raul Gardini, president of the Ferruzzi Group, said the present management of the CPC milling business will be asked to remain in their posts.  \n',26
'Gruppo Ferruzzi is studying a project which could result in a public share offer of up to 49 pct of its French unit European Sugar (France) and could raise around 400 mln dlrs, Ferruzzi chairman Raul Gardini said.     Gardini tolds the operation under consideration was aimed at \"international markets\" and that the figure of 400 mln dlrs given in some press reports \"was probably about right.\"     European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA, is expected to absorb the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy.     Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs.     A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but gave no details.     The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the CPC business.  \n',26
'Italy\'s Gruppo Ferruzzi is in the advanced stages of negotiations that could result in an acquisition worth \"some hundreds of billions of lire\" in the European agro-industrial sector, a company spokesman tolds.     The spokesman declined to identify the other party or parties involved in talks, or whether a complete takeover was under discussion, but said an Italian newspaper report that Ferruzzi was studying the possibility of advancing an offer for 13 European cereal processing plants owned by the U.S. Group CPC International Inc CPC.N was incorrect.     The spokesman said that possibility had been evaluated by Ferruzzi but that the company\'s attention at the moment was \"decisively in another direction.\"     The spokesman, responding to a report in the Italian economic daily Il Sole-24 Ore that Ferruzzi was considering a possible bid for the CPC plants, tolds his company hoped to conclude the talks currently underway in a couple of months.

'Less than two months after First Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy, but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.     In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he\'s looking for ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991, \"so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our independence, if possible.\"     In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major East Coast banks to buy banks in California.     First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western states and has franchise operations in four additional states.     Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the  lucrative California market and the West Coast region.     While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied, \"That\'s undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive not to think that.\"     Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as \"opportunistic\".     He said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate already operates, then cut costs by combining resources.     The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy.     Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, \"We continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us.\"     Banking analysts, however, consider another First Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen any time soon.     Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25 billion dlr bid at the nation\'s second largest bank, \"a very, very difficult decision.\"     With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number four position in the California banking community.     \"The competition in this state is tough,\" he said, noting CityBank\'s recent purchase of 50 financial service branches from Sears Roebuck company. \"CityBank is moving rapidly to move us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth,\" he said.     Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona, Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.     \"Security is, has been and continues to be a highly profitable and obviously well managed company,\" he said.     He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name.     Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy, real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.     Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked, he said, \"I don\'t think it has bottomed out, because I think most of the problems are real estate-related and the real estate problems are going to be with us for several years.\"     Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in the Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate\'s franchise operation.     First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First Interstate financial services in ten states.     While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into the Midwest must come first.     Calling the franchise system, \"moderately profitable,\" Pinola said, \"It is going to take a rejuvenation of the agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed we were generating before the last year or two.\"     On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks 1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.  \n',26

'Five consortia have applied to buy the French state-owned telephone equipment manufacturer Cie Generale de Constructions Telephoniques (CGCT), which will give the owners control of 16 pct of the French telephone switching market, sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said.     The French government has given itself until the end of April to decide which applicant will be accepted, they added.     While several foreign groups have said they want to gain a foothold in the French market, their potential stake in CGCT is limited to 20 pct under privatisation laws passed last year, with 80 pct to be left in French hands.     The Finance Ministry sources gave no details of the groups interested in CGCT, but several have publicly announced their candidacies.

'The French government is to sell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in Societe Generale STGN.PA\'s regional bank subsidiary Societe Generale Alsacienne de Banque, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENAL officials said.     SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland.     Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs.     Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said.     SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160 mln this year and 159 mln in 1985.     SOGENAL\'s privatisation will be preceded by a capital increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight, giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.     The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in line with the Finance Ministry and government\'s aim of a regional operation, Geronimus said.     He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around 30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share reserved for foreign investors. \"This is too small an operation and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France,\" he said.     Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of 120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs.

'An investor group led by New York investor George Soros said it was dissatisfied with Fairchild Industries Inc management and was considering boosting its holdings to as much as 49.9 pct of the aerospace and aviation company\'s outstanding stock.     The group already controls 1,647,481 Fairchild Industries shares or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding.     The group said it filed on Wednesday with federal antitrust regulators for advance clearance to buy enough additional shares to increase its total stake to up to 49.9 pct of the total outstanding stock.     The group said its representatives had met with Fairchild Industries officials to inform them \"that they do not believe management has been successful in enhancing or protecting shareholder values.\"     It said it was considering the additional share purchases to enable it to \"assert a greater degree of influence over the future management and policies of the issuer.\"     It said a decision on the specific level of share ownership it would seek depended on market prices, future changes in management policies, available financial resources and other factors.     The group said it also reserved the right to pursue other measures intended to influence Fairchild management and policies, either alone or in concert with other investors.     The group includes Soros and Quantum Fund, an offshore investment firm headquartered in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles that is advised by Soros.     The group said that since its last SEC filing, made Jan. 2, it had purchased no additional Fairchild shares and had sold 6,700 shares on the New York Stock Exchange Jan. 19.     A Fairchild Industries official later said Soros had told the company he was not dissatisfied with its management.     \"Contrary to the filing, Mr. Soros has told the company today that he is not dissatisfied with management,\" Fairchild\'s Bill Fulwider tolds.     However, Fulwider said the company would have nothing to say at this time about Soros\' disclosure that he may buy up enough additional Fairchild shares to hold as much as 49.9 pct of the company\'s outstanding stock.  \n',26

'Guinness Plc GUIN.L , the brewing group, has challenged a 5.2 mln stg payment to a U.S. Lawyer who says he organised its controversial takeover of Scotch whisky maker The Distillers Co Plc.     But attorneys for lawyer Thomas Ward, a member of the Guinness board, told a court yesterday in the Channel Island of Jersey that Ward saw the payment as his reward for services in last year\'s 2.7 billion stg takeover.     Britain\'s Department of Trade and Industry is investigating the takeover.     Guinness says its former chairman Ernest Saunders and Ward \"breached their fiduciary duty\" in authorising the payment to Ward, via a Jersey-based company, Marketing and Acquisitions Consultants and has gone to the Jersey court to recover it.     MAC said in defence documents that Ward was the main negotiator in the battle for Distillers against rival bidder Argyll AYLL.L Group Plc.     \"The bid would not have been successful but for the ... Services of Mr Ward,\" MAC attorneys said in the documents submitted in court. \"The payment was, in all the circumstances, reasonable, proper and fully earned.\"  \n',26
'Guinness Plc GUIN.L will seek an injunction in the U.K. High Court today to freeze the assets of former Chairman Ernest Saunders in its attempts to recover 5.2 mln stg paid to a Jersey company as part of the company\'s takeover battle for Distillers Co Plc, a spokesman said.     He said the court move aimed to freeze Saunders\' assets up to the value of the sum it wanted to recover. It was uncertain whether the court would reach any decision on the request today. Guinness said last week it planned to take legal action to recover the funds, paid to non-executive director Thomas Ward via the Jersey company.     Lawyers representing Ward have said he saw the funds as his reward for services performed during the takeover of Distillers.

'Guinness Plc GUIN.L said it has started court proceedings against former chairman and chief executive Ernest Saunders and non-executive director Thomas Ward for recovery of 5.2 mln stg.     The money was paid to Ward via Marketing and Acquisition Consultants Ltd in Jersey.     Guinness said earlier it would propose a resolution at the annual meeting in May to remove Saunders and Ward as directors of the company.  Earlier this month, lawyers for Ward told a Jersey court that Ward saw the payment as his reward for services in last year\'s takeover battle for Distillers Co Plc.     Guinness has said that both men breached their fiduciary duty in authorising the payment.

'Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc said that, due to poor market conditions for railway freight car manufacturing, it plans to sell its Trenton Works division in Trenton, Nova Scotia.     Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7.7 mln dlrs for the proposed sale.     It also said lower 1986 earnings were due to much lower earnings in transportation equipment and losses in steel castings and forgings, which offset gains in the mining sector and improvements in forestry equipment.     Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipment was limited with export sales frequently restrained by customers\' financing difficulties.     Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railways continued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements at the lowest level in the past decade.     However, there was demand for industrial casting due to increased hydro-electric power generation, the company said.     The company said manufacturing of mining machinery and tunnelling equipment showed greatly improved results in the U.S. and export markets, mainly China and India.     The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity in aircraft engine repair and overhaul and in the manufacture of engine components.     Sawmill equipment and skidder operations were affected by a strike in British Columbia and the extended debate on U.S. imports of Canadian lumber, but there were encouraging signs at yearend, the company said.  \n',26

The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports, said \"He continues to be interested were the group to offer the brewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put together a consortium, nor has he been buying shares.\"     He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as saying he would be interested if it came on the market and that he had the support of two international banks if he decided such a purchase might be worthwhile.     In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewing profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts, the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts.     \"A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for the brewing division in the current Guinness situation,\" he said.     \"This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge, but not impossible,\" he added.

'The price of Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd SHLH.HK\'s stock soared on speculation of a takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd EVGH.HK group, stock brokers said.     They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an announcement by Evergo\'s China Entertainment and Land Investment Co Ltd unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk Hotels from the firm\'s deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06 billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.     Thomas Lau, Evergo\'s executive director, declined comment on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels. But he tolds the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment.     He said Evergo \"was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels.\"     Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia\'s best known hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by Hk Hotels.     Lai Sun Garment Co ltd yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.     Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.     \"It is purely coincidence,\" he said.     But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.     Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.     Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board.     A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far.     Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management styles.     \"Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not fit the conservative Kadoorie family,\" said an analyst who asked not to be named.     Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the current trading price.     Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo, China Entertainment and the group\'s associate Chinese Estates Ltd.     Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday, China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74 cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs.  \n',26

'An investor group led by members of the Hunt family of Dallas, Texas, told the Securities and Exchange Commission it has acquired a 6.2 pct stake in Comdata Network Inc CDN and may try to influence company policy.     The investor group, led by Rosewood Financial Inc, said it opposes a company recapitalization plan worked out between Comdata and Mason Best Co, a Texas investment firm, which last reported holding about 9.5 pct of the company\'s stock.     The Hunt group said it offered on March 3 to buy the entire 5.3 pct stake held by dissident shareholder Donald Carter at 14 dlrs each, but has received no reply as of yesterday.     Rosewood, which is owned by the Caroline Hunt Trust Estate, whose trustees include Margaret Hunt Hill, also said it has notified the Federal Trade Commission of its intent to buy between 15 and 25 pct of Comdata\'s common stock.     Under federal law, it cannot buy more than 15 pct of Comdata\'s stock until a 15 to 30 day waiting period is over, unless the FTC gives it early approval.     Under the proposed Comdata recapitalization plan, the company would buy up to 10 mln of its common shares at 13.25 dlrs each.     Mason Best, which belongs to CNI Parnters, a Texas partnership, would not tender any of its stake under the plan, but would instead buy another one mln Comdata common shares and would get representation on the company\'s board.     The Hunt group said it has told Comdata that it considers required payments under the plan, such as a 1.5 mln dlr fee and the issuance of a warrant to buy 500,000 common shares to be a waste of the company\'s assets.

'Corporate raider Carl Icahn acknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible violations of securities laws.     Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc TWA, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to make with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group.     The SEC issued a formal order launching the private investigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing.     The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out whether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities laws and related rules, Icahn said.     Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition and subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain unspecified companies, he said.     Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals who have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes in companies of at least five pct within 10 days.     Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in connection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he has disclosed that he is among those being investigated.     By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which is obviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was also alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA.     It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they or their officers are the targets of government probes to acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements to their shareholders.     Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and selling more than five pct of a company\'s stock.     SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities law violations have been spawned by the agency\'s widening probe into the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according to published reports.     Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amount of stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or making no filing at all could indicate a scheme to \"warehouse\" shares of stock.     In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting in concert would each amass stock in the company without disclosing that they have an agreement among them.     By failing to disclose that they are acting together the market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is controlled by a group acting in concert.     Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg family of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while it was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc.  \n',26

'Companies will henceforth be able to own stakes in banks, but these should not constitute a \"dominant\" holding, an Italian government committee ruled.     The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings, headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decision reflected the \"need to safeguard the principle of separation between banks and non-financial concerns.\"     It did not quantify what might constitute a \"dominant\" holding.     The committee also set conditions for the allocation of credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in them, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held by banks in companies or other banks.     Under the ruling, credits given by banks or their subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank\'s capital must not exceed defined limits.     The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifth of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or two-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the group or individual concerned.     Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign banks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks to subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be excluded from the conditions.     The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank\'s capital are not given privileged treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms.     With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank of Italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a bank\'s consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a company or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or indirectly.     Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held is below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest.     The controls will not be exercised in cases where the value of the bank\'s stake in a concern is below the lesser of two predefined limits.     These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the total assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank.  \n',26
'Italy\'s state-owned Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro-BNL said it is negotiating to buy a West German bank as part of its foreign expansion policy.     BNL president Nerio Nesi told a news conference the Italian bank was currently involved in talks but declined to name the German institution.     He said the takeover move could be seen as BNL\'s reply to Deutsche Bank AG DBKG.F, which entered the Italian market in December 1986, with the purchase of BankAmerica BACN subsidiary Banca D\'America e D\'Italia.     Nesi said BNL had also approved a 200 mln dlr credit line to the Soviet Union aimed at enabling Soviet companies to pay for Italian imports. He gave no further details.     BNL officials said the group had also decided to increase its activities in the Soviet Union by opening a representative office in Moscow this month through its subsidiary Sogecred, which specialises in Italian-Soviet trade.  \n',26

'Japan has sought to assure the U.S. It is not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese international telecommunications company below the legal limit of 33 pct, a Post and Telecommunications ministry official said.     In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister Shunjiro Karasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S. Firms that have expressed interest.     But it does oppose any foreign international telecommunications carrier having a management role, he said.     The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Opposition to the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete with the current monopoly Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd, and to reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.\'s Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L, industry analysts and diplomats said.     One of the rival firms, International Telecom Japan Inc (ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firms including General Electric Co GE, Ford Motor Co F and Citibank NA CCI), and two European companies, ITJ president Nobuo Ito said yesterday.     Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a second potential KDD rival, International Digital Communications Planning Inc, along with C Itoh and Co. Merrill Lynch and Co Inc MER and Pacific Telesis International Inc PAC, both of the U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively.     The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the merger of the two firms because it says the market can only support a single KDD competitor.     It has also rejected management participation by an international common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless, arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists.     Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, Jonathan Solomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless\' share to less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20 pct, the ministry official said.     Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitor would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless\' share, industry analysts said.     \"Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one combined competitor,\" Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst Darrell Whitten said.     \"Political ... Leverage may get the total foreign share up to a certain amount, but you won\'t find any one company with an extraordinarily large holding,\" Whitten said.     Western diplomatic sources were more blunt.     \"They (the ministry) don\'t want to see Cable and Wireless with a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of strategies to reduce that share,\" one said.     Fumio Watanabe, a senior Keidanren (a leading business organization) official who has been trying to arrange the merger, will present a new outline of his proposal on Thursday, the ministry official said.  \n',26
'A Foreign Ministry official dismissed arguments made by senior U.S. Government officials seeking to block the sale of a U.S. Microchip maker to a Japanese firm.     \"They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues,\" Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry\'s North American Division tolds.     U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the sale of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp to Japan\'s Fujitsu Ltd ITSU.T, U.S. Officials said yesterday.     Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale.     U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while Japan\'s supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales.     Takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner, Schlumberger Ltd SLB, does not include Fairchild\'s main defence-related division.     In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make supercomputers.     Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said.     Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying \"the purchase would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor market.\"     Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said.     The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said.     U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite U.S. Firms\' technological lead in the field.     \"The United States believes Japan will only react when bullied, and this is a bullying ploy,\" Salomon Brothers Asia analyst Carole Ryavec said.     However, the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors.     \"The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,\" said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co.     U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan\'s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening Japan\'s market.     A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those set by the pact.     \"It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,\" he tolds.     Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with Schlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman tolds.  \n',26
'Cable and Wireless PLC CAWL.L and the Pacific Telesis group PAC.N may take part in a proposed merger of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan\'s international telecommunications market, a senior industry official said.     Fumio Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), told a news conference Japanese shareholders in the two consortiums agreed that the U.S. And British companies will be invited to participate in the new merged firm.     The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo\'s request that only one private company should enter the market.     The two consortiums, International Digital Communications Planning Inc (IDC) and International Telecom Japan (ITJ), were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co (KDD) after the market was deregulated in 1985.     Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the size of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign investors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake.     He estimated the two foreign firms\' share in the merged consortium at less than three pct and added that even the largest shareholders could own only some five pct .     Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house C. Itoh and Co. each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium while Pacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. MER.N jointly hold 13 pct .     ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses. Several firms including Toyota Motor Corp. TOYO.T  belong to both.     Watanabe said progress was being made towards a merger agreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with the government on having only one private consortium as two companies might invest \"excessive\" amounts.     He said talks with Cable &amp; Wireless will continue this week.  \n',26
'Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L is resisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunications firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a change in those plans, a company executive said.     Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one of the two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its share to three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategy Jonathan Solomon told reporters.     That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerful business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm of protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign firms from a meaningful position in the market.     Pacific Telesis Group PAC.N of the United States also holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia, International Digital Communications Inc (IDC).     Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz have written to the Japanese government about the planned merger.     A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also expressed opposition to the merger, he said.     The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again that it sees no need for two competitors to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which holds a monopoly on international calls from Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreign shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm.     In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today met Fumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange the merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked.     At stake is C and W\'s 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre optic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of its global network.     \"C and W wants to start right away on the project, such as application and other procedures,\" said Watanabe, who is also chairman of Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc. The Japanese side is saying that the decision on such a plan should be left with the new firm, after the merger.     \"These decisions (on the merger) were made in consideration of Japan\'s economic conditions and legal systems. I told him we are not a colony or something,\" said Watanabe.  \n',26
'Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. Computer and semiconductor maker, U.S. Officials said yesterday.     The officials told reporters Baldrige had serious concerns on national security grounds about the sale of Schlumberger Ltd SLB unit Fairchild Semiconductor Inc to Fujitsu Ltd ITSU.T. The officials said the sale could leave the United States overly dependent on a foreign company for equipment used in advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence gathering.     The U.S. Officials added the sale would also worsen the strained relations between the two countries stemming from the huge Japanese trade surplus.     The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the sale in the coming weeks, they said.     Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger\'s position was not known, but in the past, he has opposed the transfer of high technology to foreign governments or companies.     Computers made by U.S. Manufacturers are widely used in the world, but Tokyo told U.S. Negotiators recently it prefers local manufacturers and would not buy U.S. Supercomputers.  \n',26

'NV KLM Royal Dutch Airlines KLM.AS is \"absolutely not\" negotiating a takeover of U.S. Regional carrier Air Atlanta, a KLM spokeswoman said in a comment on an article in the leading Dutch evening paper NRC Handelsblad.     \"U.S. Law requires that at least 75 pct of shares in a U.S. Airline be owned by American firms or persons,\" the spokeswoman added.     The newspaper said that Air Atlanta, which flies to 11 U.S. Cities, has a fleet of five Boeing jets with passenger capacity of 110 and employs 400 people, is making losses.     She said KLM had started talks with Vendex International NV VENN.AS on their jointly owned courier service XP Express Parcel Systems, but declined to confirm an NRC Handelsblad report saying it wanted to buy the Vendex stake in XP.

'The Bank of England does not favour the introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said.     Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries\' annual dinner.     Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in.     \"Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators, for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all, the proprietors of the company,\" Leigh-Pemberton said.     He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more efficient market penetration. \"The degree of success or failure (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested,\" he said.     Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past. \"The aim is to pressurise a company\'s management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly or even primarily at the expense of the future,\" he said.     Such bids \"often depend for their success on creating a highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market, and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,\" he said.     In a clear reference recent events, he said \"those in the City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest, be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result.\"     They \"should exercise the most careful judgment at the outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the activities contenplated.

'Mathematical Applications Group Inc said it has signed a letter of intent to sell all of its operating business and will propose a plan of liquidation following the sale.     If the company is unsuccessful in obtaining the approvals needed for the sale and liquidation, it said, the company may be required to initiate reorganization proceedings under federal bankruptcy law to facilitie the distribution of its assets.     Mathematical Applications said it tentatively agreed to sell its direct marketing business to Pagex Inc for 400,000 dlrs plus an amount equal to the working capital of the business at closing as well as a 1.7 mln dlr note payable in installments over six years.     Mathematical Applications said the business\' working capital is estimated to be about 600,000 dlrs.     Pagex has been formed by Paul A. Goldner the owner of Pagex Systems Inc, which is also engaged in the direct marketing computer service business.     Mathematical Applications said the tentative agreement calls for Pagex to buy substantially all of the assets and liabilities related to the direct marketing business and continue to use the Mathematical Applications name.     It said the sale is also subject to renegotiation of a real estate lease and approval of a definitive agreement by the company\'s board, stock holders and debenture holders.

'Attorney General Edwin Meese said he saw some benefit in the proposed purchase of American Motors Co AMO By Chrysler Corp C in that it would return the smallest of the U.S. auto manufacturers to American hands.     Meese told the House Appropriations Subcommittee that consideration would be part of the Justice Department\'s review of the proposed merger. He said the agency has not yet received a formal notice of the merger which would start the review process.    Chrysler has made a 1.3 billion dlr bid to buy AMC from its French parent Renault.     \"I think one of the things that has to be recognized in that merger is that it appears, at least, that a good portion of the ownership of American Motors, which has been in overseas hands will be put back in American hands,\" Meese told the subcommittee.     \"That may be one of the factors that would be weighed in the judgment,\" he added.

'Automobile dealerships have become large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1 billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.     Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts say.     Retail car sales \"are at a point of transition. There\'s not much that\'s off the table in terms of creative thinking\" about ways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University of Michigan\'s Transportation Research Institute.     The retail car market is \"much more freeform now\" than it was in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.     Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different. Dealerships sold one kind of car--a \"Chevy\" or a Ford or a Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold 738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association.     That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany\'s Volkswagen Beatle--began to gain popularity. The \"Bug\" caused \"a rebellion\" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers, says Jauppi.     One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year, the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers.     \"I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln dlrs a year and didn\'t know what to do with all his money,\" says Cole.     \"There\'s a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that make cars,\" he says.     With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend will let up.     Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D. Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by 1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800 principal owners today.     Many dealers are experimenting with owning several franchises, some of which might compete against each other. \"It used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines,\" Jauppi says.     As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned or open international operations.     Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers, \"are obviously thinking of very seriously,\" says Cole.     Although some say the franchise system might get in the way of a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to trading in car dealer shares.     \"Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those cars. It could happen any time,\" Jauppi says.     \"If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the scale some of these dealers, it\'s going to be very hard to resist taking them public,\" said another analyst.     And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become international.     \"We\'re going to have international dealers--dealer networks that are worldwide,\" he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted particularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster than the U.S., he says.     \"It\'s not totally off the wall,\" says Cole.  \n',26

'Nippon Life Insurance Co is pursing a possible link with an American securities house to expand its overseas investment portfolio, a company spokesman said.     But he declined to comment on rumours the company would take a 10 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers, an investment banking unit of American Express Co AXP.     He said the firm started to sound out several U.S. Investment banks on capital participation about 18 months ago and was narrowing the number of prospects, but he did not say if it had set its sights on one firm.     Nippon Life, Japan\'s largest life insurer, also plans to set up a wholly owned investment unit, Nissei International America, in New York next month and subsidiaries in Canada, Singapore, the Cayman Islands and Jersey this year, he said.     These moves are in line with its long-term strategy to put more emphasis on overseas investment management as opportunities at home are declining while the company\'s assets are growing.     The company is especially attracted by the scale and depth of U.S. Money and credit markets and wants to establish a firm foothold there, the spokesman added.  \n',26
'Nippon Life Insurance Co\'s 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said.     The investment in one of Wall Street\'s top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. \"It\'s part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.     The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.     Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.     The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing.     Nippon Life is Japan\'s largest insurance company and the world\'s biggest institutional investor, analysts said.     The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.     The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers\' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments.     Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co\'s board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.     Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,\" he said.     \"It\'s a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there\'s an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\"     Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said.     To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms\') diversification. Now there\'s a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,\" Smithson said.  \n',26
'GTX Corp said Nippon Steel Co of Japan, in a move to diversify into high technology, invested eight mln dlrs in GTX.

GTX noted that Nippon is expecting sales of 27 billion dlrs by 1995. Of that amount, six billion dlrs is targeted for electronics.

Nordbanken is Fermenta\'s third largest creditor with loans of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main shareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mln crowns until a new equity issue could be made.     Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders\' meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue.     Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results.     Fermenta\'s new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra 170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor and shareholder Gotabanken and the group\'s new majority owner Industrivarden AB.     The share price was to be 20 crowns. But there has been doubt over the plans since the stock fell below this level this week after Fermenta\'s former chairman Kjell Brandstrom said the company was in a much worse state than he thought.  \n',26

'The Reagan administration will consider curbing foreign takeovers of security-sensitive industries such as semiconductors and computers, the New York Times said, quoting an unnamed senior administration official.     \"I think there\'s a strong sentiment here that some industries are not totally up for grabs,\" the paper quoted the official as saying.     \"Two of the most visible (industries) are semiconductor and computer companies,\" said the official, who the newspaper said was a central figure in the opposition to Japan\'s Fujitsu Ltd ITSU.T takeover bid for Fairchild Semiconductor Corp.     The Fairchild-Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday, and industry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reagan administration in its drive to beat back Japanese competition in the important computer chip manufacturing industry.

'peru will sell about 40 state-owned firms to trim a projected 740 mln dlrs loss this year among government-owned companies.     Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others would be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino, president of the government\'s state company holding firm, the national development council (conade).      He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all or part of the companies.     Independent economists warn that the deficit could push inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the govenment target of 40-50 pct.     Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline with a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in eight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits.     Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold, including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock exchange.

He told reporters the government organisation had expressed interest in one seat on SMC\'s 15-man board and was preparing to invest 800 mln pesos, assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a share.

'The Securities and Exchange Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed.     Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers for companies\' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid.     Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions. As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached.     In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said clarifies the SEC\'s present position, the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived, even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so.     The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a \"material change\" of the tender offer under U.S. securities law, SEC officials said.     The SEC has already said that other specific material changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer.     The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived.     SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days.     The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information. Officials declined to identify the two offers.     \"If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination,\" the SEC said.     Federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least 20 business days.  \n',26

Edward Markey, D-Mass, the chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the start of a hearing on SEC activities.     \"Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come,\" Markey said. \"The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania is particularly distressing.\"     Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high fines and disbarment from the securities industry.     \"Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing through to legitimate investors and traders,\" Shad said in his statement.     Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years.     Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought the tender offer process needed reform including earlier disclosure of takeover attempts.     N.J. Rep. Mathew Rinaldo, the senior subcommittee Republican, said he was introducing legislation to create a five member commission to study the securities industry for a year and report its findings and recommendations to Congress. Commission members would be appointed by the SEC.     \"Its primary mission would be to analyze the extent of illegal trading on insider trading and to assess the adequacy of existing surveillance systems and government oversight operations. The commission would advise Congress as to what additional resources or civil or criminal remedies are needed to combat fraud and improve compliance with federal laws,\" Rinaldo said.  \n',26

'Siemens AG SIEG.F rebutted U.S. Criticism it is blocking American Telephone and Telegraph Corp\'s T.N, AT and T, entry into French telecommunications firm Compagnie Generale Constructions Telephoniques, CGCT.     Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that the acquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T and Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV PGLO.AS had not been decided on two years ago as claimed by AT and T.     The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemens at the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT. The result of the negotiations was still open.     Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.     The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairman James E.

CGCT\'s share of the French switchboard market amounts to around 16 pct.     The French government has limited CGCT participation by foreign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francs for the whole company.

'A top Swiss banker called for an obligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds and said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company should be made to declare their share.     In comments at a news conference of Vontobel Holding AG, chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks\' own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board, to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in.     A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swiss franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers.     Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the market with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which were readily available to professionals through specialised information systems.     \"We should make this classification obligatory and publish it in places that are easily accessible to lay people,\" he said. The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these ratings should also be continually updated, he said.     Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies, worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered shares and participation certificates rather than bearer shares.     However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. The recent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG JACZ.Z to take over Hero Conserven Lenzburg HERZ.Z had shown the limits of a 1961 pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone who was not eligible according to the company\'s statutes.     Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do not carry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle of greater democracy in the new share law before Parliament.     \"People buying, for example, more than five pct of a company\'s shares should be made to declare their purchase,\" he said.  \n',26

'TMOC Resources Ltd told shareholders not to accept Santos Ltd\'s STOS.S 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid pending advice from Macquarie Hill Samuel Corporate Services, its corporate advisor.     It said in a statement the Santos bid was below the underlying value of the shares as assessed by Macquarie Hill Samuel at between 4.08 dlrs and 4.72.     TMOC, formerly the Moonie Oil Co Ltd, said the valuation was made in response to an earlier and still current bid of 2.55 dlrs a share by Elders Resources Ltd. Elders Resources holds 19.9 pct of TMOC\'s 62 mln shares.     TMOC said it did not know Elders Resources\' response to the bid or that of its other major shareholder the Australian Gas Light Co. The latter has a 10.5 pct stake in TMOC.     Avalon Corp of the U.S. Has a 17 pct stake in TMOC through an option agreement.     Santos, which is 15 pct owned by Elders Resources, yesterday said its bid valued TMOC at 248.5 mln dlrs.     TMOC said today this was not a premium over the share price before the bid and that TMOC had traded at up to 4.06 dlrs a share in the last two weeks.     TMOC said in the statement that the bid was unsolicited and that Santos had only a 3.07 pct stake despite paying up to four dlrs a share on-market.     TMOC has oil and gas interests and pipelines which complement the operations of Santos, the major Cooper Basin oil and gas producer.     TMOC shares today closed five cents up at 4.15 dlrs on turnover of 182,000 shares while Santos, due to release its profit result today, rose eight cents to 4.50 dlrs on volume of 245,000 shares.  \n',26
'Toshiba Corp TSBA.T said it regrets its plan to enter the U.K. Business facsimile and telephone market may be caught up in a diplomatic row over the position of Cable and Wireless Plc\'s CAWL.L in the Japanese market.     Britain is considering how to retaliate against Japan\'s attempt to prevent Cable and Wireless from taking a major position in a Japanese international telecommunications venture.     \"As a matter of timing it is regrettable that this has been linked with the question of market access in Japan,\" a Toshiba spokesman tolds.     Toshiba Information Systems (U.K.) Ltd, a Toshiba subsidiary, said yesterday it planned to enter the U.K. Market under the Toshiba own brand name and had applied for government approval to do so.     Toshiba has supplied equipment to U.K. Manufacturers for sale under their brand names since last year.     The Toshiba spokesman said the sale of such equipment was not comparable to Cable and Wireless\' efforts to take a stake in the new Japanese telecommunications firm.     \"They are matters of a different category,\" he said.  \n',26
'The state-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB) will fund Toyota Motor Corp\'s TOYO.T planned purchase of its bankrupt former local partner\'s manufacturing facilities for at least 193 mln pesos, a bank official told reporters.     Toyota has informed the Philippine government it plans to produce cars again here in joint venture with a local partner.     It proposes to invest about 400 mln pesos in the manufacture of car spare parts and other items, and generate about 100 mln pesos in export earnings over five years.     The banker said today a letter of intent was signed three weeks ago but the sale requires approval from government agencies charged with selling private sector assets taken over by state-owned banks.     Official sources said Toyota\'s application was likely to be approved.     Toyota severed ties with its Philippine partner of 20 years, Delta Motor Corp, in 1984 because the local company was suffering financial difficulties. PNB later foreclosed on Delta\'s assets.  \n',26
'Equity investment company Battery Group Ltd said it had agreed to buy Occidental Life Insurance Co of Australia Ltd from TransAmerica Corp TA of the U.S. For 105 mln Australian dlrs.     The acquisition has been made possible by the efforts of its major shareholder, Pratt and Co Financial Services Pty Ltd, Battery Group said in a statement.     The purchase will be partly funded by the issue of eight mln shares at 4.50 dlrs each and four mln free options to the Pratt Group, controlled by entrepreneur Dick Pratt, plus four mln shares to professional investors at 4.50 each, it said.     The balance will be funded by debt, Battery Group said.     The acquisition is subject to the approval of its shareholders.     On completion of the share placements, Pratt Group will effectively have 51 pct of Battery\'s enlarged capital, assuming exercise of all options, it said. Battery now has 22 mln shares on issue.

'The British Conservative government said it would sell off its remaining 31.7 pct shareholding in British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L during the next financial year which starts on April 1.     Treasury Financial Secretary Norman Lamont made the announcement to Parliament. He said, \"The government\'s policy is to sell its minority holdings in companies as and when circumstances permit.     \"As part of this policy I am now able to announce that, subject to market conditions, the government will sell its remaining shares in BP during the 1987/88 financial year.\"     The last sale of British government shares in BP was in September 1983.

Merchant banks and stockbrokers interested in being considered for this would be interviewed in early April.     In September 1983, the U.K. Government sold 150 mln shares in an underwritten offer for sale by tender.

The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce approved as an amendment to the overall House trade bill a provision giving Reagan the power to block sales to foreign companies if the sale was not in the national or economic interest.                     The takeover provision was sent to the full Energy and Commerce Committee for consideration as part of the overall trade bill which is being written by several House committees.     The subcommittee\'s bill would bar imports of digital audio recording equipment that is not made with anti-copying chips. This provision is designed to protect U.S. companies from the unauthorized use of U.S. designs in foreign products.     The bill calls for an investigation of whether U.S. engineering and construction firms are given adequate opportunity to bid on Japan\'s civil works procurement practices including the construction of the Kansai airport.

'The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is reviewing whether Trans World Airlines Inc TWA and Chairman Carl Icahn violated federal antitrust law by failing to seek advance clearance from the DOJ or the Federal Trade Commission for his extensive open-market purchases of USAir Group Inc U stock, a DOJ official told a Senate panel.     \"This is a matter that is being looked into,\" Charles Rule, acting assistant attorney general-antitrust, told the Senate Judiciary Committee\'s Antitrust Subcommittee.     Rule declined further comment while the review was continuing.     Rule was responding to panel Chairman Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), who had asked why the department was not acting against \"what appears to be a clear violation of the law.\"     Metzenbaum said Icahn had failed to file a pre-merger notification form with the FTC prior to purchasing more than 15 mln dlrs\' worth of USAir stock.     But Rule said that, for airline companies, a purchaser would be exempt from the requirement if it instead had filed a merger application with the U.S. Department of Transportation.     Icahn filed such an application with the DOT, but the filing was thrown out by the DOT on Friday.     The DOT threw out the application late Friday on grounds it lacked the necessary data for the government to review the proposed USAir takeover bid.

'The Securities Industry Association backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile corporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insider trading in law.     The industry trade association called on U.S. securities firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to guard against illegal trading by employees.     The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers.     But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition activities so long as those functions were kept separate.     The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board of directors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stock exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages.     The report said securities firms \"should be more rigorous in restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis.\"     It said firms should train their employees to understand the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information.     It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid expanding current law in a way that would impede the market.     It said an insider trading definition should exempt a securities firm from liability for law violations by its employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of the wrongdoing.     In the mergers and acquisitions area, the association advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover protection plans without prior shareholder approval.     It said a group or individual buying up a company\'s stock should be required to file a public disclosure statement before acquiring more than five pct of the company\'s shares. Under current law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days after exceeding the five pct limit.     The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a company\'s voting stock shouls be made only through a tender offer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is no limit on open market purchases.     The group said the federal government should preempt state regulation of defensive takeover tactics.     The group said all tender offers should remain open for at least 30 calendar days.     The current requirement is expressed in business days.     It said so-called \"lockup\" devices, in which securities are issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of the target company\'s total common stock.     Association president Edward O\'Brien said the group acted out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate America on Wall Street and investor fears about insider trading and fairness in the marketplace.  \n',26
'U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction blocking the planned merger of Delta DAL Airlines Inc and Western Airlines WAL, the Court said.     O\'Connor\'s action came hours after a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation had been settled by arbitration.     A Supreme Court spokesman said O\'Connor granted a stay of the injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs, to go through as planned later today.     The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Each of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to provisionally overturn its rulings without comment.     The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of Atlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the merger for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes belonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles.     \"Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,\" Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late last night. \"There was really very little that remained to be done.\"     The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport Employees union sought to force Western\'s management to fulfill a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took place.     The airlines argued that Western\'s promise could not be enforced in a takeover by a larger company.     After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officials last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees should report for work today in their old uniforms, not in new Delta outfits.     Delta announced last September that it was purchasing Western. The merger took place in December, and Western has been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Western name was to have disappeared at midnight last night.     At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to represent Western employees after the integration of the two airlines.     While all but eight pct of Western\'s 11,000 employees are unionized, only Delta\'s pilots are union members.     Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts with Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the Teamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be \"extinguished\" after today.  \n',26

A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said no exact date had yet been set for the privatisation, which the government has tabled for the second half of March. However, he added a scandal at Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, VW, over currency losses \"has nothing to do\" with the timing of the VEBA sale.     Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale of the Federal government\'s stake in VW, originally scheduled for later this year, may be delayed because of the currency affair.     A banker involved in the VEBA placement said \"Nothing has changed in the planning. I still presume that it will take place in the second half of March.\"     This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the issue of the 10 mln VEBA shares for a few days. He added that the consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its preparatory work, although the price had not been decided.     The VEBA share has been weaker ahead of the placement but West German stocks have been generally bearish and news of the VW scandal last week put further pressure on the market.  \n',26
'the council of ministers approved petroleos de venezuela\'s planned purchase of a half interest in the champlin petroleum refinery at corpus christi, texas, government sources said.     The cabinet authorized energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti to approve the purchase in the shareholders assembly of the state oil company petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa).     Pdvsa last april 14 signed a letter of intent to buy a half interest in champlin\'s corpus christi refinery for an undisclosed sum.     Under the terms of the provisional agreement, venezuela would supply up to 160,000 barrels a day to the plant through a new company which would be jointly owned by the pdvsa and champlin, a subsidiary of the union pacific corp unp.

The move by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, one of the institutions at the core of the group of companies formed by the late industrialist Marcus Wallenberg, further consolidated group control over one of its key firms, analysts said.     The foundation now controls 14.1 pct of Ericsson\'s voting rights with 22.3 pct held by the group\'s investment companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia.

'Sweden\'s Wallenberg group fought back a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to secure a large stake in Swedish Match SMBS ST, one of the companies at the core of their business empire.     A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.     Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier NOBL ST, in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.     Swedish Match\'s B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares.     The statement said the deal increased Investor\'s stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.     The Wallenbergs\' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.     The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.     The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo VOLV ST out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco ASTS ST and Stora Koppabergs SKPS ST.     Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST by Skanska AB SKBS ST and Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.     Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB ALFS ST.     During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent any raid on the heart of their business empire.     But analysts say the Wallenbergs\' position in the electrical engineering firm ASEA AB ASEA ST is also too small at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe interests to protect its core activities.  \n',26

'Industrial holding company Williams Holdings Plc said it was bidding 542.2 mln stg for the ordinary shares of building products and packaging group Norcros Plc.     The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams shares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share     Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last night of 397p.     A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to propose from the outset the right terms, including a full cash alternative.     The offer will include a partial convertible alternative under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69 mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their ordinary share allocations.     The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for a value of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.     Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986 rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.     Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in the market for several months, dealers said. Initially it centred on Bunzl Plc, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.     Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also result from normal trading.     In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a rise in pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover that lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln     Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a market capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its capitalisation up to around 380 mln.     The convertible offer would be on the basis of four Williams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a share. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of 400.2p a share.     The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price down to 733p from last night\'s close at 750p.     Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or 0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct.     There was no immediate response from Norcros.  \n',26
'Wilson Brothers said it completed the sale of most of the assets of its Enro Shirt Co Inc, Enro-At-Ease Inc and Foxcroft Shirt Ltd subsidiaries to Enro Acquisition Corp for about 24.2 mln dlrs, half in cash and half in subordinated promissory notes.

'Woolworth Holdings Plc WLUK.L said it would make a 244 mln stg agreed bid for Superdrug Stores Plc valuing the company\'s shares at about 696p each.     The offer would be made on the basis of 17 new Woolworth ordinary shares for every 20 in Superdrug.     Woolworth said it had received acceptances from the holders of 61 pct of Superdrug shares.     The bid is Woolworth\'s second attempt in recent months to acquire a retail chemist chain. Earlier this year it negotiated a possible bid for Underwoods Plc buit the talks were broken off two weeks ago.     Full acceptance of the offer would involve the issue of about 29.8 mln new Woolworth shares, or 14 pct of the enlarged share capital. A cash alternative would offer 646p for each share in Superdrug. Members of the Goldstein family have accepted the offer for 11.7 mln shares, which have not been underwritten.     Another major shareholder, Rite Aid Corp\'s Rite Investments Corp unit, had accepted the offer for 9.9 mln shares, and would take the cash alternative for 9.0 mln of these.

'Fire protection and security group Wormald International Ltd WOIA.S said British-listed Holmes Protection Group Inc has agreed to issue it with 6.15 mln common shares of one U.S. Cent par-value at 1.72 stg each.     The two groups have also begun exploratory talks on a possible merger of the Holmes business with the compatible businesses of Wormald, comprising some or all of its fire protection and security businesses in the Americas and Europe, Wormald said in a statement.     The issue of shares in the New York-based Holmes is conditional upon shareholder approval at a general meeting.     Wormald said its stake will represent 9.99 pct of Holmes\' existing issued shares and 9.09 pct of the enlarged capital.     The issue will raise 10.6 mln stg which will be used for further development of the Holmes business.     Wormald said the businesses of the two groups are largely complementary in terms of both geographical spread and the nature of their activities, with Holmes concentrating on burglar alarms and Wormald on fire systems.     Holmes\'s operations are concentrated in and around New York amd Miami. It earned 11 mln U.S. Dlrs pre-tax in its last reported full year, 1985, and 6.0 mln in first half 1986.  \n',26

'Australia\'s current deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in February from 1.23 billion (revised from 1.29 billion) in January, the Statistics Bureau said.     This compared with an 897 mln dlr shortfall a year earlier.     February merchandise trade recorded a 42 mln dlr surplus against a 246 mln shortfall (revised from 287 mln) in January and a 162 mln deficit in February 1986.     The current account deficit fell at the lower end of the range of forecasts of 700 mln to one billion dlrs made by market economists yesterday.     February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion dlrs from 2.74 billion (revised from 2.72 billion) in January and 2.54 billion a year earlier while FOB imports fell to 2.77 billion from 2.99 billion (revised from 3.01 billion) against 2.70 billion a year earlier, the Bureau said.     It said a four pct decline in rural exports, despite an 11 pct rise in wheat exports, was more than offset by a seven pct rise in non-rural exports, notably minerals and fuels.     On the import side, the main decreases were falls of 17 pct in machinery and transport equipment and 21 pct in fuels, the Bureau said.     The net services deficit narrowed to 146 mln dlrs from 253 mln (revised from 268 mln) in January and 192 mln a year earlier, the Bureau said.     This made a sharply lower deficit of 104 mln dlrs on the balance of goods and services against deficits of 499 mln in January and 354 mln a year earlier.     Deficit on net income and unrequited transfers was 646 mln dlrs against 736 mln in January and 543 mln a year earlier.     Official capital transactions in February showed a surplus of 786 mln dlrs against a 2.56 billion surplus in January and a 505 mln surplus a year earlier.     Non-official capital and balancing item showed a 36 mln dlr deficit against a 1.33 billion deficit in January and a 392 mln surplus in February 1986, the Bureau said.     The cumulative current account deficit for the first eight months of fiscal 1986/87 ending June 30 widened to 9.37 billion dlrs from 9.32 billion a year earlier.     The cumulative trade deficit narrowed to 2.09 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion and the services deficit to 2.25 billion from 2.75 billion but the transfers deficit widened to 5.03 billion from 4.36 billion. The cumulative official capital surplus narrowed to 2.90 billion dlrs from 3.86 billion.  \n',27
'Australia\'s current account deficit for February is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln and one billion dlrs, from the unrevised January level of 1.29 billion, market economists polled bys said.     Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow.     The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January, after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598 mln dlrs.     As an example they quoted wheat export volume, which rose about 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January.     A lack of aircraft imports in February should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit, the economists said.     Other positive influences on the current account balance should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of certain official aid payments, they said.     They said the Australian dollar, which last week touched an eight-month high of 0.6900 U.S. Dlrs but is now around the 0.6800 level, should not react adversely to the figures unless the current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs.  \n',27
'Canada\'s current account deficit widened to a seasonally adjusted 2.27 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter from a deficit of 1.94 billion dlrs in the third, Statistics Canada said.     The shortfall for the full year rose to 8.81 billion dlrs from 1985\'s 584 mln dlr deficit, the federal agency said.     The agency said the rise in the merchandise surplus, to 2.77 billion dlrs from 2.20 billion dlrs in the third quarter, was more than offset by high deficits in servicies and investment. The total non-merchandise deficit grew to 5.04 billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs.     The current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1985.     In the capital account, not seasonally adjusted, there was a total net inflow of 4.76 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, up from a net inflow of 3.22 billion dlrs in the third quarter quarter.     The total net capital inflow rose to 13.74 billion dlrs in 1986 from 7.68 billion dlr in 1985.  \n',27
'Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said today\'s downgrading of Denmark\'s credit rating by Standard and Poor\'s Corp should not be over-dramatised.     Standard and Poor\'s said it had downgraded the Kingdom of Denmark\'s long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, following the country\'s loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983.     \"This change is regrettable but there is no reason to dramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor\'s defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top AAA rating,\" Simonsen said in a statement.     \"The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing capability is unlikely to be very great. But if, against expectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external account deficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and capability,\" he added.     \"Standard &amp; Poor\'s has noted that in 1986 there was a series of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and encourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect.     \"If and when it becomes necessary, the government will be ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives as it has in the past,\" Simonsen said.    Standard and Poor\'s said weaker international competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external debt.     The external current account deficit rose to a record preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in 1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns, according to government statistics.     Government economists forecast that the external current account deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year.     Denmark\'s net foreign debt rose to 129 pct of total exports in 1986 from 83 pct in 1983, S and P said.  \n',27
'The Dutch current account surplus fell 5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billion guilders, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.     The surplus is expected to fall further in 1987, the statement said, but gave no details. Earlier today, the official planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus to fall to six billion guilders during 1987.     The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6 billion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining terms of exchange, while more goods were imported as consumer spending and investment increased.     While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion guilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay between the fall in oil and gas prices.     The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on invisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the Finance Ministry said, noting the surplus on transport services was reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price falls.     The fourth quarter current account showed a deficit, for the first time since 1980, of 700 mln guilders, it said.  \n',27
'China\'s foreign debt reached 27 billion dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to short-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign bankers and Chinese officials tolds.     Foreign bankers said China\'s total debt rose sharply from an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low, between eight and 10 pct.     China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said.     Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on 1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct.     Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.     A Western banker said China\'s portfolio contains too much short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive low interest rates in the Japanese market.     The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.     A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the country\'s total debt at about 30 pct.     The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.     \"Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China, which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread,\" he said.     The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is in part a result of China\'s inexperience in the foreign capital markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.     \"Officials do not think of China but of their own department or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the full backing of the People\'s Republic of China,\" he said.     \"The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to exercise indirect controls,\" he said.     The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the past six weeks that China\'s foreign borrowing will not be affected by a drive against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a phrase meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16.     A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China\'s foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially stated figure of 10 billion dlrs.     \"The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in advance of an announcement the reserves were down,\" he said.     The banker said such buying has not been going on. \"Things are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in 1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development.\"     Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985.     A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official said this year\'s outlook for exports, which account for more than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier than a year ago.     The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It was quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago.     The official said China has taken measures to improve its export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and the establishment of export production bases.     \"We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year,\" he added.     Official estimates put China\'s 1986 export losses from the drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs.     A Western diplomat said China\'s foreign debt needs careful management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six to eight pct.     \"We base our assessment not on China\'s foreign exchange reserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a company on its performance, not its bank account,\" he said.     He said China performed very well in the export field last year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have few difficulties in increasing its borrowing.  \n',27
'The net inflow of foreign investment into Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billion a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said.     The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08 billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billion turnaround in direct investment.     The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a 520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account of government foreign currency borrowings, it said.     Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billion dlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal in the third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourth quarter of 1985, the Bureau said.     It said the major part of the turnaround reflected an injection of funds, estimated at around 700 mln dlrs, associated with the previously reported restructuring of the Australian operations of General Motors Corp GM.     GM used the funds to pay out or take over certain Australian liabilities of its local unit General Motors-Holden\'s Ltd, it said.     However, net borrowings remained the major part of total inflow, accounting for 6.16 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter against 3.88 billion in the third quarter and 4.03 billion a year earlier, the Bureau said.     Net official borrowings comprised 1.52 billion dlrs against a net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mln inflow a year earlier.     Total private and semi-public authority net borrowings rose to 4.64 billion dlrs from 4.42 billion in the third quarter and 3.51 billion a year earlier.  \n',27
'The French 1986 current account balance of payments surplus has been revised slightly upwards to 25.8 billion francs from the 25.4 billion franc figure announced last month, the Finance Ministry said.     This compares with a 1.5 billion deficit in 1985, and while it is the first surplus since 1979, is substantially lower than the 50 billion surplus forecast by the previous socialist government before they lost office in March last year.     Net long-term capital outflows rose sharply to 70.5 billion francs last year from 8.8 billion in 1985, largely due to a major program of foreign debt repayment, the ministry said.     In the fourth quarter alone the unadjusted surplus rose to 14.1 billion francs from 6.6 billion the previous quarter, but the adjusted surplus fell to 7.4 billion from 9.1 billion.     Fourth quarter medium and long-term foreign debt repayments exceeded new credits by 11 billion francs.  \n',27
'France\'s current account payments surplus slipped to a provisional 300 mln francs, seasonally adjusted, in January from a downward revised surplus of 3.8 billion in December, the Finance Ministry said.     The December figure was revised from a provisional 4.8 billion franc surplus reported a month ago.     On an unadjusted basis, January payments showed a 5.2 billion franc deficit after a revised 7.1 billion December surplus. The December unadjusted surplus was revised down from a provisional 8.2 billion.     The Ministry said trade, measured on balance of payments criteria, showed an unadjusted 7.1 billion franc January deficit while services showed a 3.7 billion surplus.     Other items, mainly including unilateral transfers, showed a 1.8 billion deficit.     The current account showed an adjusted surplus of 6.1 billion francs in January last year, and an unadjusted deficit of one billion.

'West Germany\'s current account surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in February from a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, a spokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said.     The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4 billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.     The Statistics Office had originally put the January current account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.     The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billion mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the current account surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus recorded in February 1986.     A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the February current account surplus compared with January was due to seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current account figures are seasonally adjusted.     February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled 32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986 but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.     Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56 billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct compared with January.     The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate the real change in exports and imports in February. But for comparison purposes it noted that in January the average value of imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average value of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.     Within the current account, the services account had 300 mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark surplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark deficit.     Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in value terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a year earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks, a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.     The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for January/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1 billion marks in the year-ago period.     The cumulative current account surplus for January and February 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion marks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.     Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as seasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlier this week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against January while export prices were unchanged.     \"The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend that is not expected to change for several months at least,\" said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987 as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record 112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.     An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) in Frankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a more accurate picture of West Germany\'s trade position.     He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January and February together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus posted in November and December.     \"The trend is clearly lower,\" he said.     This economist, who declined to be named, said the February rise was also partly explained by special factors in January, when there had been a number of public holidays as well as extremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.  \n',27
'The inflow of long-term capital into West Germany slumped to 606 mln marks in February from January\'s record 11.91 billion, with foreign purchases of German bonds and shares declining sharply, the Bundesbank said.     While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth of German bonds in February after 13 billion in January, they sold a net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of public authorities after sales worth 300 mln in January.     With German investors\' purchases of foreign securities steady around 1.3 billion marks, only 2.2 billion marks were imported through securities transactions, after 11.2 billion.     Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60 billion marks in February after 2.83 billion in January.     There was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short-term capital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January.     Banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds while domestic companies increased their short-term financial assets abroad by 700 mln. But public authorities received some one billion marks from abroad, the Bundesbank said in a statement.     Combining long and short term capital outflows, West Germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks in February against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January.     The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widened to 10.45 billion marks in February from January\'s 7.20 billion.     Taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. In terms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing of the surplus was progressing, the bank said.     Germany\'s current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion marks in February from 4.79 billion in January, but was down on the 7.26 billion figure for February 1986. Seasonally adjusted, the February current account surplus narrowed against January.     While exports in February fell a half pct against the same month last year, imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to the drop in prices. Exports grew three pct in volume and imports two pct.     In the balance of services, a fall in net investment income led to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln mark surplus in January.     The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion marks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3 billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the European Community budget.  \n',27
'Italy\'s overall balance of payments showed a surplus of 1,461 billion lire in February 1987 compared with a deficit of 1,145 billion in January, provisional Bank of Italy figures show.

The long-term capital account deficit widened to 11.40 billion dlrs from 8.06 billion a year ago, but it narrowed from 12.32 billion in January, the Ministry said.     Japan\'s February exports rose to 16.74 billion dlrs from 14.89 billion in February 1986 and from 14.65 billion in January, the Ministry said. Imports fell to 8.61 billion from 10.12 billion a year earlier and 8.94 billion in January.     The invisible trade deficit fell to 617 mln dlrs in February from 693 mln a year earlier, but was up from a 527 mln deficit in January.     Figures do not tally exactly because of rounding.     Transfer payments narrowed to a 140 mln dlr deficit last month from a 185 mln deficit a year earlier and a 225 mln deficit in January.     The basic balance of payments deficit in February fell to 4.02 billion dlrs from 4.17 billion in February 1986 and 7.37 billion in January. Short-term capital account payments swung to a 1.28 billion dlr deficit in February from a 1.60 billion surplus a year earlier and a 1.44 billion dlr surplus in January.

'The Australian dollar rose more than 40 points and money market interest rates retreated on the better than expected improvement in the February current account deficit, but economists and dealers were cautious about identifying it as the start of a downward trend.

The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one billion dlrs for March.     Banque National de Paris BNPP.A senior dealer Peter Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and interest rates were too high for import substitution and export industries.     Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875 and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow.     Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at 2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January.     But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal exports remained poor. \"We should remember we are paying something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near term,\" Buttrose said.     Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln dlrs, and added \"Any figure under a billion dollars will be acceptable (to the markets).\"     ANZ Banking Group Ltd ANZA.S senior economist Ian Little said the big question was whether the improvement in exports could be sustained. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion dlrs from a revised 2.74 billion in January.     Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news, with 90-day bank bill yields falling to 16.42-16.45 pct from early highs of 16.50 and yields yesterday as high as 16.65.     Longer term yields fell with 10-year bonds at 13.66/68 pct from 13.74 before the release and highs of 13.87 yesterday.     The stock market was easier at midsession but brokers said the current account data had little impact on trading.  \n',27

'Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said.     He tolds the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985, which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.     Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year.     This year\'s target of 20 pct \"might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful,\" he said.     Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government\'s economic planning, said Turkey\'s creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.     \"We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years,\" he added.     His comment echoed last October\'s Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said Ankara\'s case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.     \"In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit,\" he said.     Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits.     Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.     \"We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,\" he said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986.     More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage exports, and production incentives were being considered.     \"We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned,\" Tigrel said.     He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible.  \n',27
'The U.S. current account deficit widened to a record 36.84 billion dlrs on a balance of payments basis in the October-December fourth quarter of 1986 from a revised 35.29 billion dlrs in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said.     Previously, the department said the third-quarter deficit was 36.28 billion dlrs.     For the full year 1986, the current account, a broad measure of trade performance, was in deficit a record 140.57 billion dlrs after a 117.68 billion dlr deficit in 1985.     The department said an increase in the merchandise trade deficit during the fourth quarter to 38.4 billion dlrs from 37.1 billion dlrs in the third quarter was the main reason for the worsening deficit.     Net service receipts declined to 5.5 billion dlrs in the final quarter from six billion dlrs in the third quarter.     The current account includes trade in merchandise and services as well as U.S. financial transactions with the rest of the world.     The department said the merchandise trade deficit for all of 1986 grew to 147.7 billion from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985.     Net service receipts were 22.3 billion dlrs in 1986, compared with 21.7 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said.     Net unilateral transfers during the fourth quarter last year, covering foreign aid and government pensions, were down to 3.9 billion dlrs from 4.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter because of fewer U.S. government grants to Mideast countries.     Liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S. banks rose 35.3 billion dlrs between October and December after increasing 30.1 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     For the full year, these liabilities grew 77.4 billion dlrs after rising by 40.4 billion dlrs in 1985.     The department said inflows were boosted in the fourth quarter by international activities of Japanese banks and strong demand within the United States to finance acquisitions.     Net foreign sales of U.S. Treasury securities by foreigners were 2.7 billion dlrs in the quarter after purchases of 500 mln dlrs in the third quarter.     Net foreign purchases of securities other than U.S. Treasury securities in the fourth quarter were 11.8 billion dlrs, compared with 17.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     For all 1986, foreign purchases of securities excluding U.S. Treasury securities were a record 70.7 billion dlrs, surpassing the previous record 50.9 billion dlr total in 1985.    Claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks in the fourth quarter rose 29.9 billion dlrs after a 19.3 billion dlr third-quarter increase.     U.S. sales of foreign securities rose to 2.7 billion dlrs from 300 mln dlrs in the third quarter because of a sharp selloff of foreign stocks and bonds, the department said.     Outflows for U.S. direct investment abroad fell to 5.7 billion dlrs from eight billion dlrs in the third quarter.     Foreign direct investment in the United States increased 14.4 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.6 billion dlrs in the previous quarter, because of stepped-up acquisitions, the department said.     Foreign official assets in the United States increased 800 mln dlrs between October and December after rising 15.4 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     For the full year 1986, foreign official assets grew 33.4 billion dlrs after a 1985 decrease of 1.9 billion dlrs as foreign monetary authorities intervened heavily in exchange markets late in the year as the dollar fell, commerce said.  \n',27
'The U.S. merchandise trade deficit on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said.     The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15 billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.     For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said.     During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78 billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.     The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and insurance.     The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose 1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.     Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18 pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars and a nine pct decrease from Japan.     On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.     Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were limited by drought.     Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700 mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200 mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.     The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries, including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell 500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter.     In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3 billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.     Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6 billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs from 26.41 dlrs.     Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell 27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and soybeans nine pct.     The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1 billion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe increased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs.  \n',27
'Domestic demand is now expected to make no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.     However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.     But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth.     The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.     Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated.     \"The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion,\" he said.     Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track, Keating said.     \"They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time,\" he said.     \"On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment.\"     Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.     \"Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane,\" he said.     Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand.     He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income.     The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.     \"The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88,\" Keating said.     \"As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further, and given continued effective wage restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,\" he said.  \n',27
'Australia\'s seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product (GDP) rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 after rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter, the Statistics Bureau said.     This compares with a 1.1 pct fall in the fourth quarter of 1985.     Compared with the year-earlier quarter, GDP also rose 1.1 pct, the Bureau figures show.     The annual rise compares with a 0.3 pct fall in the third quarter compared with the 1985 third quarter and a 4.3 pct rise in the year-earlier period, the Bureau figures show.     Real non-farm gross product rose 0.9 pct in the fourth quarter after zero growth in the third quarter and a 1.3 pct fall a year earlier, making an annual rise of 0.8 pct.     Gross farm product rose 4.3 pct compared with rises of 2.6 pct in the third quarter and 2.8 pct a year earlier, making annual growth of 6.6 pct.     Elements in the fourth quarter GDP rise included falls of 0.6 pct and 0.2 pct in private and government final consumption expenditure respectively, the Bureau figures show.     Gross fixed capital expenditure fell 0.1 pct in the quarter while exports of goods and services rose 13.0 pct and imports 2.9 pct.     Seasonally-adjusted expenditure on GDP at average 1979/80 prices rose to 36.67 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter from 36.26 billion in both the third quarter and the year-earlier quarter.

'A meeting of leading politicians, bankers and economists has forecast Austrian real gross domestic product growth for this year at between 0.5 and 1.5 pct, a government spokesman said.     This compared with a two pct growth forecast made by the semi-official Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) last December.     Helmut Kramer, spokesman for Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, tolds that the forecast had been made during the meeting attended by Vranitzky, Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina, National Bank President Stefan Koren and a WIFO representative.     Economists have been cutting growth forecasts recently mainly due to expectations of a poor export performance this year, notably to Eastern Europe and oil exporting states.     Hannes Androsch, general director of Creditanstalt-Bankverein CABV.VI, today put 1987 GDP growth at between one and 1.5 pct.     Kramer also said the meeting had heard that unemployment for the year would be above the 5.5 pct forecast, but was unlikely to be more than six pct.  \n',27
'French 1987 growth will probably be about two pct, the same as last year, due to an international environment that is less favourable than expected, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted as saying.     Treasury director Daniel Lebegue said last month that gross domestic product is expected to grow by between two and 2.5 pct this year, against an original target of 2.8 pct.     Although in line with the latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimate of 2.1 pct growth, the forecast will be balanced by growth in investments and exports, Balladur said in an interview with the daily Les Echos.     Last month Balladur said French GDP had grown by just two pct last year, compared with an initial 1986 target of 2.5 pct and 1.1 pct growth in 1985.     He told Les Echos he aims to reduce the 1988 budget deficit to 115 billion francs from this year\'s figure of 129 billion and compared with a 141 billion deficit in 1985.     He has already announced his intention of cutting the deficit to 100 billion francs in 1989.  \n',27
'Gross domestic product is expected to grow by 4.4 pct in the year ending June 30, Finance Minister Mohammad Syeduzzaman told reporters.

The World Bank and other independent sources have said inflation would be around 15 pct in 1986/87.     Syeduzzaman said remittances from expatriates would rise to 600 mln dlrs this year from 425 mln in 1981/82.     Foreign exchange reserves at end-June are projected at 680 mln dlrs compared with 105 mln in 1981/82, he said.

'External risks for the economy have increased, but growth of two to 2.5 pct this year is still possible, according to President of the West German Federation of Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth.     Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the further fall of the dollar since the start of this year and the revaluation of the mark against European currencies meant West German exporters were facing a \"rough wind.\"     However, domestic demand was continuing to rise and private consumption in particular would support the economy, he said. He saw good prospects for consumer industries.     Schroeder-Hohenwarth said economic policy now had to concentrate on strengthening this domestic growth. In this context, he welcomed a decision by the government to increase the scope of tax cuts due in 1988.     He added, a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduled for 1990, which was worked out by coalition partners this month, was an \"important step in the right direction.\"     The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from 56 pct. However, Schroeder-Hohenwarth said the decision to cut the maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was \"rather half-hearted.\"  \n',27
'An internal report produced by the Belgian National Bank foresees the country\'s gross national product growth falling in 1987 to 1.0 pct from 2.3 pct in 1986, the independent newspaper Le Soir said.     A National Bank spokesman said the newspaper article was basically correct, but that the report was produced six weeks ago and figures were therefore to some extent out of date.     The government\'s planning bureau predicted growth of 0.9 pct this year in a study published last month.  \n',27
'Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987 government financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs.     He said this will enable the requirement to be held to 419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of 417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product.     Martens said following a lowering of government estimates of 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by government departments of 1987 spending, the government calculated that unless action was taken, the requirement would exceed the target by 22.5 billion francs.     Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receipts by 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion. The remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised through treasury operations.     Martens said the money is being found through a series of small economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of two billion francs through the sale of part of the government\'s 50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz.     Last year, the government announced a major program designed to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs.     The program was designed to get Belgium out of what the government said was a \"snowball effect\" under which the government constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits which were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying existing debt.     In 1986, the government financing requirement is estimated at 561 billion francs or 11.0 pct of GNP.  \n',27
'The Belgian government has lowered its forecast for the nominal increase in gross national product in 1987 to 3.5 pct from an originally forecast 3.9 pct, Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said in a statement to parliament.     He said this revision, which brings government forecasts more closely into line with those by private institutions, takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economy and international trade.     But he said the impact on the Belgian economy will be limited due to recent agreements on wages and working conditions agreed by employers and unions.     Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP to grow in volume terms.     However, last month the government\'s Planning Bureau said it had revised its 1987 forecast for this to 0.9 pct from 2.0 pct.     In 1986, Belgium\'s gross national product rose 2.15 pct in volume terms against a 5.9 pct nominal rise.  \n',27
'Bolivia is to make a formal offer during the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bank president Jier Nogales said.      Nogales tolds in an interview the steering committee of Bolivia\'s creditor banks had agreed to consider the offer at a meeting in New York last month.      He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian paper on the international secondary debt market, where it now trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value.     Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the discounted rate in full.     Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to 30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the international markets, he added.     Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans to commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said there would be no money available to restart traditional debt servicing to them for some time.      Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs, but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at discounted rates.     Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in the next few months.      He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over the price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would make a single non-negotiable offer.     He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly creditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The only traditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which would mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss provisions, he added.     \"We are confident that the banks are going to be reasonable,\" Nogales said. \"Now they can resolve their problems for once and for all.\"     \"The most conservative ones who want a little more will wait a year, but I don\'t know if the window of opportunity will be open all the time,\" he added.     Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia\'s four billion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed to governments and the rest to international agencies, Nogales said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent discussions with the Paris Club.      He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, while accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interest rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris Club rules, he added.      He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with Argentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt.     He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from international agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year.     The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs last year, he added.     Nogales said that Bolivia\'s net international reserves now stood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs in disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro took office in August, 1985.     Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct a year in the government\'s first month in office, was now down to 10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and the plan was that it should continue at this level.     He said the government was also expecting at least three pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative rates.  \n',27
'Brazil\'s Gross Domestic Product, GDP, rose by 8.2 pct in real terms last year following an 8.3 pct increase in 1985, the Geography and Statistics Institute said.     In money terms this equalled 3.6 trillion Cruzados, giving per capita GDP of 26,120 Cruzados, or 1.6 pct above the level achieved in 1980 before the recession of 1981-1983, the Institute said in a statement.     Agricultural output, hit by adverse weather, fell by 7.3 pct last year led by coffee production which was 46 pct down.     Industry grew 12.1 pct, including capital goods by 21.6 pct and consumer goods by 20.3 pct, while services were up 8.3 pct.  \n',27
'Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said he expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of 1986.     \"We see moderate growth,\" Crow told a news conference following presentation of the central bank\'s annual report in the House of Commons today.     He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy, particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth quarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.     Crow reiterated the bank\'s previous statements that inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy and said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada\'s inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.     The governor said Canada\'s banking system remains sound despite recent concern about exposure by the country\'s banks in debt plagued countries such as Brazil.     \"It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but I think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact,\" Crow told reporters.  \n',27
'Canada\'s gross domestic product, by industry, rose a seasonally adjusted 1.2 pct in December, the largest monthly gain since April, 1986, Statistics Canada said.     GDP, which fell 0.2 pct in November, was 2.1 pct above the December, 1985 level, the federal agency said.     Output of goods producing industries rose 1.6 pct in the month, with virtually all the growth occurring in manufacturing and mining. Services producing industries expanded 1.0 pct.  \n',27
'Canadian economic growth is expected to slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should keep the country from recession, economists said.     \"The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth over the course of 1987,\" said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.     Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product, grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion, but down from 1985\'s four pct.     In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter.     \"Essentially it is a flat performance,\" said Warren Jestin, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.     Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc said \"it shows the economy is not moving along very steadily, it\'s not a very promising number.\"     \"We weren\'t surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter in Canada, but we don\'t think there will be a recession,\" she added.     The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this year.     Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.     Statistics Canada also reported the country\'s trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs from the previous year\'s shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.     \"The sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,\" the federal agency said in a statement.     The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.     But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S. economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and help fuel the country\'s modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of Canada\'s exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.  \n',27
'Canada\'s real gross domestic product, seasonally adjusted, rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, the same as the growth as in the previous quarter, Statistics Canada said.     That left growth for the full year at 3.1 pct, which is down from 1985\'s four pct increase.     The rise was also slightly below the 3.3 pct growth rate Finance Minister Michael Wilson predicted for 1986 in February\'s budget. He also forecast GDP would rise 2.8 pct in 1987.     Statistics Canada said final domestic demand rose 0.6 pct in the final three months of the year after a 1.0 pct gain in the third quarter.     Business investment in plant and equipment rose 0.8 pct in the fourth quarter, partly reversing the cumulative drop of 5.8 pct in the two previous quarters.  \n',27
'Canada\'s gross domestic product rose 0.1 pct, seasonally adjusted, in January after gaining 1.0 pct in December but falling 0.1 pct and 0.3 pct in November and October, Statistics Canada said.     January\'s rise, in 1981 prices, was fueled largely by a 0.5 pct gain in the goods producing sector. Output in services-producing industries declined 0.1 pct from December\'s level.     January\'s level was 1.29 pct higher than the same month a year ago.     The federal agency said it was the second straight gain for goods producing industries. Most of the growth occurred in manufacturing and construction.     Within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood, machinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups. Significant declines were recorded in the output of automobiles and parts, however.     In the services sector, increases in finance, insurance and communication were more than offset by declines in transportation, storage and the retail trade.  \n',27
'chile\'s gross domestic product rose 5.7 pct last year to 18.8 billion dollars, compared to a 2.4 pct rise in the previous year, the central bank said.

The sectors which registered the greatest growth in 1986 were fisheries with 10 pct, agriculture at 8.7 pct, transport and communications with 8.1 pct and industry at 8.0 pct, the bank added.  \n',27
'Austrian gross domestic product growth for this year is likely to be between 0.5 and 1.5 pct, Helmut Kramer, head of the semi-official Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) said.     This compared with a two pct growth forecast made by the WIFO last December.     Kramer made the forecast at a meeting today on Austria\'s economic outlook also attended by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina and National Bank President Stefan Koren.  \n',27
'Leaks of a major Dutch official economic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this year, political and market sources say.     Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness this year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage increase, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth.     But whatever the government\'s response, the central bank will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say.     The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB) publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and the economy.     Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch economic growth was now seen around one pct.     Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar, Pierson said in its February economic outlook.     The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of 2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September.     The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990.     Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder.     Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised the guilder\'s revaluation in line with the West German mark in last January\'s European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness.     But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment.     Some analysts also question the central bank\'s decision not to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge.     Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on the money market, noting \"the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already far below the market rates.\"     Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest rate policies serve that goal.     Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold to take profits.     Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.     Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.     Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first.     One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down to reduce the government debt burden.     A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between the ministry and the central bank. \"The cabinet\'s policy is steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark,\" he said.  \n',27
'Dutch economic growth is slowing as a firming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries reduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planning agency CPB said.     The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economic outlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected to grow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in 1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.     Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20 billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increase from last year\'s 423.95 billion.     The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value of the guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pct last year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an average of 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.     \"The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit labour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, while these are rising slightly in the Netherlands,\" the CPB said.     More of economic growth now depended on domestic consumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins set by domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on purchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.     Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, the CPB said. Inflation was zero last year.     Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five pct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last year, the CPB said.     Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to condition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent years, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of these factors on Dutch competitiveness.     In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social security costs to employers.     The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2 pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year, urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down the deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in future.     Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by falling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.     It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this year from 710,000 last year.     While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is within its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two pct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.     Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in its February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant prices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts had expected the CPB\'s final forecast to be below its own latest estimate.     \"It is too early to comment because I haven\'t seen the whole document yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some of our estimates,\" a Pierson economist said.     The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in 1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy exports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said.     Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with four pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said.     The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the surplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1 billion last year, the CPB forecast.  \n',27
'The Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria\'s 1987 gross domestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct forecast made last December.     WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw the one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, as the upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revision due to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.     A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil producing states, combined with the effects of the dollar\'s fall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.     Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this year. After last year\'s 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private consumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct in 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.     Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2 pct last year due to the slack economic activity.     Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit of about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion surplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria\'s central bank, last month forecast the current account would be roughly in balance this year.     However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have no notable effect on the government\'s attempts to cut the budget deficit. This year\'s aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9 pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, he said.  \n',27
'The Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986, private economists said.     Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand, was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year, the economists said.     They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years.     The report said Japan\'s gross national product rose a real 0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous quarter.     It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from 4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis.     They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales.     But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off.     \"Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises,\" said Shoji Saito, general manager of Mitsui Bank\'s economic research division.     He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of  falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit hard by the yen\'s rise.     Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor. Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures, he said.     Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute, said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins.     \"This is just a one-shot spending and we can\'t expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter,\" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito\'s reign.     Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending.     Saito said the most effective government action would be income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a proposed controversial sales tax.  \n',27
'This year will see a pickup in U.S. economic growth and inflation, the Shadow Open Market Committee said in its semi-annual policy statement.     The SOMC, a group of basically \"monetarist\" private economists, said that \"economic growth will accelerate in 1987 in response to powerful stimulative actions by the Federal Reserve.\"     The group said the Fed\'s actions have been excessive. As a result, it said that \"inflation and ultimately another recession now loom on the horizon.\"     The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on progressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead to sustainable economic growth and stable prices.     The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or inflation growth in its policy statement. However, the Committee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it was basically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is a member of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.     Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage point higher than in the past two years. He expects consumer prices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year.     The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been a principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costly inflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to \"abandon its inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary base on the path toward sustained lower inflation.\"     The Fed in February said it would no longer target the narrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 and economic growth has been largely severed.  \n',27
'Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the world and said that progress was being made.     \"It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve\'s promotion of price stability is critical to the successful implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients for growth,\" he told the Eastern Economic Association.     Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of fronts. \"Federal Reserve monetary policy, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and the Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the right direction,\" he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain, France, Japan, West Germany and Canada.     On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment toward slowing the growth of federal spending.     There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National Product were declining and would continue to drop, he said.     But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep interest rates stable.     \"This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely. Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive federal spending,\" he said.     A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the main objective of the Fed, Johnson said.     He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of exchange rates was needed for long-term growth.     On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against \"quick fix\" solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation or protectionist trade legislation.     \"What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine economic growth,\" he said.     Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow for its gradual resolution over time.  \n',27
'Finland\'s gross national product is expected to rise by three pct in 1987 against two pct in 1986 and inflation will be unchanged at about 3.5 pct, the private business survey office ETLA predicted.     Unemployment in 1987 is put at 5.5 pct, in line with last year, the office predicted in its regular review.     The balance of payments would show a five billion markka deficit in 1987, against a 4.2 billion deficit in 1986.  \n',27
'French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9 pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.     The report said the French economy was \"increasingly ill-adapted to demand\" selling goods at \"uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets.\"     \"France\'s poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months,\" it said.     Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986, it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to \"a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries.\"     This could result in further major losses of market share, particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports, it said.     Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the authorities would have \"little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly,\" it added.     But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.     Written mainly in December last year, the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the government\'s deregulation of service sector tariffs.     \"We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost,\" one OECD official commented.     OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct.     The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year\'s 2.1 pct.     But the OECD backed the government\'s view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year, with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year\'s fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation.     With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said.     On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits.     \"For the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,\" it said.  \n',27
'France\'s Economic and Social Council (CES), an advisory body comprising industrialists, trade unionists and representatives of other sectors of the French economy, said the country\'s annual growth may not reach two pct in 1987.     French gross domestic product risks not reaching the two pct growth registered last year, the Council said in a report on first quarter 1987 economic activity without giving any specific forecasts. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted today as saying that French 1987 growth will probably be about two pct.     Balladur said in an interview with the financial daily Les Echos that the country\'s economic growth will probably be about the same as last year due to a less favourable international environment.     CES President Philippe Neeser said one of the major fears for the French economy this year was a resurge in inflation.     Disinflation was an absolute priority, Neeser told journalists, adding that a failure to do this would be extremely serious as if would be very difficult to reverse for many years.  \n',27
'French gross domestic product should grow by 2.3 pct in 1988 after two pct growth this year and 2.1 pct in 1986, the Finance Ministry said.     The latest forecast, prepared by the National Accounts and Budget Commission, assumed an exchange rate of 6.20 francs to the dollar this year and next and an average oil import price rising to 18.9 dlrs a barrel next year from 17.4 dlrs this year and 14.7 in 1986.     The Commission, headed by Finance minister Edouard Balladur, forecast a fall in consumer price inflation to two pct year-on-year at end-1988 from 2.4 pct at end 1987 and 2.1 pct last year.     In annual average terms inflation would fall to two pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year and 2.7 pct last year, it said.     Trade should show a one billion franc annual surplus this year and next after last year\'s 0.5 billion surplus, it added.     Employment should rise by 0.1 pct a year over the next two years while the state budget deficit should be cut to 2.2 pct of GDP in 1988 from 2.6 pct this year and 2.9 pct in 1986.     Other forecasts prepared by the Commission indicated a 1.8 pct 1988 rise in household purchasing power, up from 1.1 pct this year but less than last year\'s 2.9 pct, and a 1.6 pct rise in household consumption, compared with this year\'s 1.5 pct and last year\'s 2.9 pct.     Business investment is forecast to rise four pct a year this year and next after 3.7 pct last year, with private sector productive investment rising 4.9 pct in 1988 after a six pct rise this year and 5.5 pct in 1986.     The Ministry said updated forecasts would be prepared before the autumn to serve as the basis for the 1988 budget, which the government is now preparing for presentation in September.  \n',27
'French gross domestic product will grow by only 1.5 pct in real terms this year, compared with the government\'s forecast of two to 2.5 pct growth, the private Institut des Previsions Economiques et Financieres pour le Developpement des Entreprises (IPECODE) said.     However, it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986 level of two pct.     IPECODE said demand and production would develop in parallel this year, in contrast to last year when production was unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domestic demand, unleashing higher import demand.     Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298 mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals in francs by member nations, and an increase in reserves of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment of French debts.     Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM) remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs.     French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct last year, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pct in 1988, it added.     Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4.3 pct this year and 5.5 pct in 1988, down from 6.5 pct in 1986.     Inflation, which was running at 2.1 pct at the end of 1986, is likely to rise to 2.9 pct at the end of this year, IPECODE said, while the government has forecast 2.5 pct.     However, the institute said inflation would fall back to 2.5 pct at the end of 1988, \"provided that real wage costs remain within the framework of productivity rises.\"  \n',27
'Senior officials in the West German coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month\'s international monetary conference in Paris.     Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion mark reduction would represent net tax relief.     An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.     The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.     Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal increase in income tax.     An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers 1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and medium-sized companies.     The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would be introduced next year, ahead of schedule.     The West German government had come under pressure from the United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of growth was uncertain.     The government said in January it was aiming for real growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some economists have revised their predictions down to two or below.     Stoltenberg said: \"We remain on a course of expansion. Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe, or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few days ago, remains open at the moment.\"  \n',27
'The economy will grow by an average rate of 2.2 pct a year in real terms between now and the end of 1991, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB) said in an annual report.     A year ago WestLB had forecast average growth of just under three pct for 1986-1990.     The 1987 report said gross national product would only expand a real 1.7 pct this year -- below previous expectations -- because of weaker exports. Growth rates will pick up later, however, producing a 2.2 pct increase on average for the five-year period.  MORE \n',27
'Uncertainty is growing about the prospects for the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scale back investment plans, the German Savings Banks and Giro Association said.     Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, while industry is less optimistic than it was, the association said in a report.     However, last month\'s agreement among the six leading western industrialized countries to keep currencies around present levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence for exporters, it added.     The banking association said the possibility of using monetary policy to stimulate the economy should not be overestimated.     Another small drop in already low interest rates could not be expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of consumer or capital goods, it said.     The Bundesbank\'s half-point cuts in the discount and Lombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope for any further monetary moves, the association added.     On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said gross national product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar adjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the third quarter.     The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNP in the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively weak.     Bank economists have forecast the economy will either stagnate or contract slightly in the first quarter. Official first-quarter figures are due in early June.  \n',27
'The outlook for the West German economy is relatively bright, with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel University\'s Institute for World Economy said.     The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.     In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany\'s export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark\'s strength against the dollar and other major currencies.     \"The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in all, limited,\" the report said. \"On the contrary, a slight rise in exports can be expected.\"     The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges.     They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year.     West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy, the institute said.     However, it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours.     The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation.     It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession. It said central banks in industrialized countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal Reserve Board\'s expansionary course.     The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S. Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world.     Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home.     The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct.  \n',27
'The DIW economic research institute said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.     The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the other four leading German institutes, said the economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.     The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter of last year.              \n',27
'Extracts from a report by Italy\'s Budget Ministry on the country\'s economic development in 1986 showed gross domestic product (GDP) 2.7 pct higher in real terms than in 1985 but a rise in unemployment.     GDP calculated at 1980 prices rose to 434,682 billion lire last year from 423,064 billion in 1985. On a current prices basis, GDP was up 11 pct, totalling 894,362 billion lire in 1986 against 805,754 billion in 1985.      But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise in unemployment to 11.1 pct last year from 10.3 pct in 1985, the ministry said.     The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of the dollar during 1986 had favoured oil-importing countries such as Italy.     These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 6.3 pct in 1986, down from 9.3 pct in 1985.     They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance.     On the basis of data recently recalculated by the national statistics institute Istat, Italy had a trade deficit in 1986 of 3,722 billion lire, the report said. This slightly revises a previous deficit figure of 3,717 billion issued by Istat and compares with a negative balance of 23,085 billion for 1985.  \n',27
'Italy\'s gross domestic product (GDP) will grow three pct in real terms this year and 2.7 pct in 1988, said economic information company Data Resources Europe Inc (DRI).     Michel Girardin, DRI Europe\'s senior economist, said at a conference that Italian GDP growth this year \"will be mainly driven by consumption and especially investment.\"     Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next year will shift from domestic demand to exports as a result of expected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies.     Italy\'s budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7 pct in real terms in 1986.     DRI forecast that inflation, which was an average 6.3 pct in 1986, will be under five pct this year and that interest rates should drop two pct.     Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct against the dollar this year following last year\'s 22 pct appreciation. An expected German mark appreciation against the dollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of its value relative to the German currency, he said.     DRI estimates that foreign demand for Italian products should grow by a 3.2 pct this year following last year\'s 6.2 pct increase.  \n',27
'The worst may be just about over for Japan\'s battered economy but economists said they do not expect a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists polled bys said the economy\'s 18 month-old slowdown is likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. \"The economy will bottom out in the middle of the year,\" said Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido.     Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi agreed. \"It (the bottom) is in the offing,\" he said.     But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct, from two pct in the current year, he said.     Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst are increasing.     The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward the end of last year.     Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks, several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery.     Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3 pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey released last week showed that the decline in Japanese corporate earnings may be nearing its end.     And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said.     Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels.     The yen\'s 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market.     \"The important thing is the exchange rate,\" Taketomi said.     If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs of that yet, economists said.     A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to recover, economists said.     Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some loosening of the government\'s tight fiscal policy said Haruo Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.     The next reading of the economy\'s health should come early next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter, 1986.     Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.     But a senior government official said the fourth quarter figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.     To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.      The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of 1986, the official said.     Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also distorted by the government\'s sale of gold coins in the second half of 1986.     Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year bonuses, they said.     As the government had to buy back some of the coins from retailers because they were unsold, the government\'s contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been boosted, economists said.     Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last year was good.     The senior government official said the fourth quarter performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than generally expected, while that of the external sector was better.  \n',27
'The government will find it very difficult to achieve its new gross national product (GNP) forecast of three pct growth in the fiscal year ending March 31, Economic Planning Agency officials said.

'Japan\'s leading economic organisations urged the Government to prepare drastic pump-priming measures even at the cost of shelving Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s planned tax reforms, officials involved said.     Officials of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) said in a meeting with government officials the Government should issue construction bonds as an emergency measure to prop up the economy.     Keidanren suggested that proceeds from sales of stocks in the newly-privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp should also be used to stimulate the economy.     Keidanren Chairman Eishiro Saito said the dollar\'s fall below 150 yen would create huge unemployment and bankruptcies that could shake the foundation of the Japanese economy.     The Keidanren meeting coincided with a written request for drastic reflationary measures sent to the Government by the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.     Both organisations called for stepped-up Bank of Japan intervention to stabilise exchange rates.     Chamber head Noboru Gotoh told a press conference the awaited economic package should be powerful enough to push up Japan\'s Gross National Product (GNP) by about two pct.     Gotoh said the Government could cope with the present critical economic condition even if it put off its plan to stop the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.     The plan to reduce the fiscal budget is a pillar of Nakasone\'s fiscal reconstruction program.   \n',27
'Kenya\'s economy will continue to expand this year and the government will do more to encourage investment by foreign firms and the local private sector, Planning Minister Robert Ouko said.     He told a news conference that the government would soon create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment applications by local and foreign investors.     Praising the role of multinational companies and local entrepreneurs in Kenya\'s economy, the minister promised to maintain a close working contact with the private sector.     The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in 1985, Ouko said. This was owing to high prices for the country\'s coffee exports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes, he added.     \"Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices, Kenya\'s economy is still expected to improve in 1987,\" the planning minister said.     Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises announced in February, the minister added.     Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the long rainy season, which is due to start about now.     Ouko said the production of Kenya\'s main cash crops increased during the second half of last year.     Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period, he said.  \n',27
'Malaysia\'s Central Bank, Bank Negara, said the economic outlook for 1987 is good in view of a marked improvement in commodity and oil prices in the later months of last year.     It said in its latest quarterly review that real gross domestic product averaged an annual growth of 1.1 pct over the first nine months of last year compared with a decline of 0.1 pct in the corresponding period in 1985.     Growth was generated mainly by the manufacturing sector, it added.  \n',27
'The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd (DBS) said Malaysia\'s real gross domestic product growth (gdp) in 1987 could be 1.5 to two pct, above a budget target of one pct.     It said in a report that because of an economic recovery and higher foreign exchange reserves, the Malaysian ringgit is unlikely to face devaluation in the near future.     The report was presented at a two-day investment conference organised by the DBS, one of Singapore\'s four major banks.     The report said rising commodity prices and the continued expansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorous fiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds for cautious optimism about the Malaysian economy.     It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60 and 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of the year.     But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia\'s external debt remains worrying and should be controlled. It said Malaysia\'s external debt totals 48 to 49 billion Malaysian dlrs and its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct.  \n',27
'Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 1987 is expected to grow by between 1.5 and two pct, up from one pct in 1986, the central bank said.     The forecast compares with the one pct GDP growth forecast made by the Treasury last October.     Bank Negara also said in its annual report that gross national product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct, after declining 7.3 pct in 1986.     It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since last November had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil and commodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports.     Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipated rise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustain their average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added.     Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil will average 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palm oil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a rise of 12 pct in manufacturing exports.     It said Malaysia\'s international terms of trade will turn around to rise by two pct in 1987 after declining 12 pct in 1986 and five pct in 1985.     \"In 1987, income will be higher, private consumer spending is likely to recover and expand... The budget will remain under strict control... The resource gap in the government\'s finances on current account will be bridged over the near term,\" Bank Governor Jaafar Hussein said in the report.     The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1.19 billion ringgit in 1986 or 1.8 pct of GNP from 1.79 billion or 2.5 pct of the GNP the previous year.     The bank forecasts the inflation rate will increase by 1.5 pct, after its 0.7 pct rise in 1986.  \n',27
'The U.S. economy in March improved at a faster rate than in February, with the National Association of Purchasing Management\'s composite index rising to 53.9 pct from 51.9 pct, the NAPM said.     The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct. The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national product growth of about three pct.     An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy.     The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all of the indicators in the index except inventories, which declined slightly.     New orders rose sharply in March, with production also higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since August 1984.     Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM\'s business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc PBI said \"the economy ended the first quarter with a healthy, if not substantial improvement.\"     Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in March assures a good beginning for the second quarter.     Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at 2.5 pct.     The estimated average price increase anticipated by members for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as being significant.     The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.     The monthly report is based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies.  \n',27
'European Community finance ministers discussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too pessimistic.     The Commission, the EC\'s executive authority, two weeks ago cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3 per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn.     It said economic prospects had been less promising over the past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the dollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which would restrain Community exports.     But diplomats said several member states, led by West Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy, especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise currencies around current levels.     \"Many delegations feel the (Commission\'s) report is rather too pessimistic,\" said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired the meeting.     The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for West Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear it feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe.     But two top German officials, State Secretaries Otto Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need at the moment for action to bolster the EC\'s biggest economy.     The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France, while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commission\'s view that Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth. \n',27
'There is no question of stimulating consumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other reflationary policies to boost the French economy, sources close to finance minister Edouard Balladur said.     Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques Chirac\'s spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministers were agreed on the desirability of \"relaunching\" the economy.     This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a reflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruled out any such move.     The sources today said the government\'s policy remained one of \"recovery,\" or sound finances and greater efficiency.     They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion franc revenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation program will go to providing public companies with fresh capital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go toward paying off national debt.     Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30 billion would be distributed between repayment of national internal debt and public companies in similar proportions, they added.     The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when the country\'s internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct this year from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as fast as gross domestic product.     Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this year from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line with earlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.     The sources said that with France\'s economic targets for 1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, the government had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at an artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies.  \n',27
'Australia faces a major medium term adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest annual review of the Australian economy.     It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4 pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external debt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD countries.     A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth and external competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall had sharply deteriorated since June 1985.     A major shift of real resources to the external sector -- about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to grow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said.     Success depended on the setting of right policies including tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour.     Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in trade volumes.     It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored, the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of GDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by mid-1988.     Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain the competitive edge created by the Australian dollar\'s depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in order to encourage business investment.     The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing industries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to correct its external imbalances.     It added Australia should reduce protection levels in manufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would no doubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry.  \n',27
'President Alan Garcia said he sought to deepen Peru\'s hard-line foreign debt stance, possibly by limiting repayments to the World Bank.     In a televised address tonight, he criticised the World Bank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amount the bank is willing to make in new loans. \"We will deepen our policy on the foreign debt,\" he said.     Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of export earnings, effectively suspending most remittances due foreign private banks and many governments. It has generally been current for most of Garcia\'s 20 months in office on payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.     But tonight Garcia said: \"We have met our aim of limiting the payment of the debt and will limit it also even though organisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us to buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types of public works and not others, and to pay much more in dollars than that which they are willing to newly lend us.\"     The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank about 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country\'s 14 billion dlr debt.     Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin America because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic product (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line on debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year.     He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage to 1,260 intis per month, benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage workers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln.     Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants and 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but not covered by collective bargaining agreements.     He also said the price of petrol, frozen since August 1, 1985, would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis per U.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of the year. He did not say when this increase would be effective.     Taxes on petrol are the government\'s leading revenue earner, traditionally accounting for about one-third of taxes. Sales taxes on autos, liquour and cigarettes would also go up, he said, without specifying the amount.     Garcia announced the government would encourage Peruvians to repatriate their savings deposited abroad by paying a 15 pct premium above the market exchange rate.     The inti\'s official buy-sell rate against the dollar is 14.85/92 and the free rate is about 21.70/80.     To encourage private investment, he said the government would set up a special fund with which it would match every two intis of private investment with one inti from the government.     He also said his dismissal of Peruvian Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Luis Abram Cavarellino yesterday strengthened the democratic authority of his government.  \n',27
'Portugal\'s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow around four pct this year, the same rate as in 1986, according to a Bank of Portugal forecast.     Total investment this year, the country\'s second as a member of the European Community (EC), will rise nearly 10 pct, again the same rate as last year, the central bank study said.     It added that Portugal\'s current account was forecast to show a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13 billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year.     Last year\'s high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil and raw materials, lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar.     Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this year and exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and 6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said.     The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that the non-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the current government would be maintained, particularly in budget spending and income and in wage policy.     The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based on the assumption that the international economic situation and Portugal\'s world trade relations would remain more or less the same as in 1986.     The central bank said the high rate of investment estimated for 1986 was due to government policies and to increasing optimism among firms whose financial situation had improved since 1985. This tendency was expected to continue this year, especially in the construction and public works sectors.     Financial aid from the EC had also helped to boost investment last year, the bank said.  \n',27
'President Reagan said the 1.1 pct U.S. economic growth rate during the final quarter of 1986 \"wasn\'t all that bad.\"     The Commerce Department said the rate of growth of the Gross National Product in the October-December period was only slightly less than a preliminary estimate of 1.3 pct made earlier.     At the same time, it said inflation, as measured by the GNP price deflator, rose by 0.7 pct during the period.     Asked his reaction to the GNP report during a White House photo session, Reagan replied, \"It wasn\'t all that bad.\"  \n',27
'Singapore\'s gross domestic product will grow six pct in the first quarter and five pct in the second quarter this year, with further growth expected in the second half, Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong told parliament.     The figures compared with 3.4 pct contraction and 1.2 pct growth respectively for the first and second quarters of 1986.     The estimates were based on a tentative leading indicator incorporating new business orders, company inventories and share prices used by his ministry, Lee said, without giving further details of the new indicator.     Singapore\'s economy grew 1.9 pct last year, after shrinking 1.8 pct in 1985. The government has forecast growth rate of three to four pct for 1987.  \n',27
'The South African Reserve Bank, confirming previous estimates, said real gross domestic product in the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.7 pct versus 4.6 pct in the third quarter and 1.3 pct in the 1985 final quarter.     The bank, in its latest quarterly review, said the nominal growth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a 1.5 pct contraction in 1985.     But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade is taken into account, the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 1.5 pct compared with a decrease of 0.5 pct in 1985.     GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by an economy but omits income from abroad.  GNP includes such payments or outflows.     The bank also said there were indications the country\'s economic recovery was becoming more broadly based.     With the exception of commerce all major sectors of the economy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domestic production.     The bank said major increases in foreign reserves were recorded in January, February and the first half of March 1987. Reserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February.     Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70 billion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the total annual value of import payments.     The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion rand in 1986 versus 5.90 mln the previous year.     The bank said continuing strength of the current account has allowed foreign reserves to be \"rebuilt to more comfortable levels.\"     \"This has strengthened the authorities\' hands in lending support to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were to be called for,\" the bank said.  \n',27
'South Korea plans to increase the size of its budget in 1988 by 11 to 12 pct from this year\'s 15,596 billion won, Economic Planning Board officials said.     The proposed boost is based on a government forecast that gross national product (gnp) will grow by more than 7.5 pct and the gnp deflator by 3.5 pct in 1988, against targets of 8.0 pct and 3.5 pct respectively this year, they said.     Details of the 1988 budget, in which spending will match revenue, have yet to be worked out, the officials said.     The balanced budget in 1986 totalled 13,800.5 billion won.  \n',27
'South Korea\'s gross national product (gnp) is forecast to grow by nine pct in 1987, surpassing the government\'s original forecast of eight pct and against a 12.5 pct rise in 1986, an Economic Planning Board report said.     The report reviewing the country\'s economy in the first three months of this year said year-on-year gnp was provisionally estimated to have grown by about 12 pct in the period, against a 10.5 pct growth in the same 1986 period.     Board officials said the gnp rise in the January-March period is due largely to increased exports, which totalled 9.34 billion dlrs against 6.9 billion a year earlier.  \n',27
'Spain has revised some of its main economic targets for 1987 after studying the performance of the economy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in its monthly bulletin.     Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against a previous target of 3.5 pct.     Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the central bank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing at an annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to four pct if the government were to meet its five pct inflation target this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.     The forecast for private consumption growth remains unchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revised upwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.     Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected to increase by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.     Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from 5.2 pct due to the peseta\'s continuing strength against the dollar and slack external demand.     Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spending has lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from an earlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.     The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast to five pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga\'s doubts last week on whether this target could be maintained if wage settlements continue to rise above the government\'s recommended five pct ceiling.     Unions and employers dispute the average wage increases agreed so far this year. Trade unions calculate wage settlements have produced average rises of 7.3 pct against 5.5 pct estimated by the employers\' federation CEOE.  \n',27
'Sweden\'s Gross National Product rose 1.3 pct last year against 2.3 pct in 1985, mainly due to a lower than forecast growth in exports and a sharp fall in total investments, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported.

Total investments fell 0.7 pct against a rise of 6.3 pct in 1985. The Finance Ministry had forecast a rise of 0.3 pct in 1986.

'Turkey\'s Gross National Product grew an estimated 8.0 pct in 1986 at fixed 1968 prices, compared with 5.1 pct in 1985, the State Statistics Institute said.     Reporting full-year data, it also said Gross Domestic Product rose 8.3 pct compared with 5.1 pct in 1985. An earlier estimate from nine-month data put full-year GNP and GDP growth both at 7.9 pct.     The government\'s GNP growth target for 1987 is five pct, the same level it had set for 1986.     The institute estimated per capita GNP for 1986 at 1,116.6 dlrs, up from 1,045.3 dlrs in 1985.     Officials blame the high 1986 GNP growth on a surge in domestic demand stemming partly from poorly controlled municipal expenditures in the early part of the year.     Industry grew at 11.1 pct in real terms in 1986 compared with 6.6 pct in 1985 while agriculture expanded 7.4 pct compared with 2.8 pct.  \n',27
'Britain\'s gross domestic product (GDP) on the average basis of output, expenditure and income rose by 2.6 pct in 1986 after a 3.4 pct increase a year earlier, Central Statistical Office (CSO) preliminary figures show.     In the fourth quarter, GDP rose 0.7 pct over the previous quarter and was up 3.3 pct on the same 1985 quarter.     The average estimate index, seasonally-adjusted and based 1980, was set at 114.3 in the fourth quarter of 1986 against 113.5 in the previous quarter and 110.7 in the final quarter of 1985.     The CSO said the average GDP estimate index for 1986 as a whole was 113.1, up 2.6 pct from 110.2 for 1985.     On the output measure, GDP rose an upward revised seasonally adjusted 0.3 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 to 114.9 on the output index from 114.5 in the previous quarter, giving a 3.2 pct rise over the fourth 1985 quarter, the CSO figures show.     On income-based GDP, the index in the fourth quarter rose by 0.7 pct from the third quarter and was up 3.8 pct on the year-ago quarter.     The indices stood at 115.3, 114.4 and 111.0 respectively.     Expenditure-based GDP rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from the third quarter and was up 2.9 pct from the same 1985 quarter.     The CSO set the expenditure index at 112.9 from 111.6 in the third quarter of 1986 and 109.8 in the final 1985 quarter.     The year-on-year rise for expenditure GDP was 2.3 pct with the expenditure index for the whole of 1986 set at 111.9 against 109.4 a year earlier.     For income GDP, the year-on-year rise was 2.6 pct against against three pct a year earlier. The ouptut GDP measure rose 2.8 pct year-on-year, down from 3.8 pct in 1985.     The government usually considers the output measure the most reliable way of measuring short-term GDP changes.     It is based on output data for production industry and partial information for the rest of the economy.     The government had forecast that average measure GDP would rise 2.5 pct in calendar 1986 after 3.3 pct in 1985. The budget unveiled on Tuesday foresaw GDP growth in 1987 of three pct.     The GDP deflator, based on expenditure at market prices, rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter from the third, to give a 2.4 pct rise over fourth quarter 1985. Year-on-year, the deflator rose 3.7 pct.  \n',27
'Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987.     He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986.     Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this year, Lawson said.     \"As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year,\" he added.     Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0 billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP.     The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg.     On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987/88.     No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate, he said. \"But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course will the exchange rate,\" the Chancellor told Parliament.     Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 \"is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular.\"     On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987.     He said \"it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the public finances in a very strong position.\"     Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future.     \"We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term Financial Strategy\'s) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0 pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead,\" Lawson said.     \"Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course remains a major objective of government policy.\"     \"But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.\"     Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book.     On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies\' capital gains will be charged at the \"appropriate corporation tax rate.\"     He said that under the new proposed system, companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments against tax on capital gains.     \"Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988/89,\" Lawson said.     Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax, \"with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.\"     \"I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and File.\"     This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection, and would not come into force until the early 1990s.     Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their (PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred.     Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field.     On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers.     Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received.     Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21,300 stg.     New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added.     The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125,000 stg.     Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment. The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but \"genuine trading companies\" will not be affected.     He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans, also from April 1.     \"In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,\" he said.     The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct.     Lawson reiterated the government\'s aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added \"given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.\"     Small companies\' corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct, he said.     On the Lloyd\'s insurance market, Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd\'s syndicates, bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders.     The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyd\'s about the details of the legislation, he said.     \"The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyd\'s account which closes on December 31 this year,\" Lawson said.

'Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said a 0.7 pct rise in February\'s index of leading indicators pointed to stronger economic growth in the first half of 1987.     In a statement commenting on the rise last month after a 0.5 pct January decline, Baldrige noted the leading index was rising at an 8.0 pct annual rate in the six months to the end of February.     \"Based on past relationships, that gain is consistent with stepped up growth in real GNP during the first half of 1987,\" Baldrige said.  \n',27
'Senior U.S. Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets.     Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration\'s opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth.     By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.     Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments.     He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely.     Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988.     Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks pretty good to me. We\'ve had two very strong employment reports.\"     He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding, \"It looks like they\'re on track.\"     While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit, Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.     The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives, he said.     \"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform,\" Sprinkel said. \"In 1986, this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family.\"     Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit.     In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.     Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.     \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years,\" Sprinkel said.     \"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,\" he added.     However, the Congressional Budget Office\'s Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.     \"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit) are unpleasant,\" he said.     Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the \"biggest sustained inflation in our nation\'s history,\" which helped foster widespread distrust of government.     \"The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level,\" Penner said.     \"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot.\"     Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.     He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed.     \"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there\'s no ... Way to enforce it,\" Penner said.     Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets.     \"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved more than two billion dlrs,\" Penner said.  \n',27
'The U.S. Gross National Product, after removing the impact of inflation, increased at a revised annual rate of 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said.     That was down from an earlier preliminary 1.3 pct rise estimated a month ago and down from the 2.1 pct rise in the fourth quarter of 1985.     The final fourth quarter revision, however, left unchanged the previous estimate of a 2.5 pct increase in GNP for all of 1986 over 1985.     The revised estimate for fourth quarter GNP partly reflected a downward revision in inventories to a total decrease of 28.5 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, the department said.     The revisions also indicated personal consumption spending decreased 2.2 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter after an increase of 39.6 billion dlrs in the third quarter.     Exports of goods and services rose 15.3 billion dlrs after a decline of 9.4 billion dlrs in the third quarter. Imports decreased 700 mln dlrs in the final quarter, in contrast to an increase of 20.9 billion dlrs in the third quarter.  \n',27
'president jaime lusinchi defended the 20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling accord his government recently signed, saying it will open new credit flows and bring needed foreign investment to venezuela.     In his annual state of the nation speech, lusinchi also said venezuela supports other latin american debtors, despite having reached a rescheduling accord on its own.     In the 90-minute speech to the congress, lusinchi summed up the achievements of his administration, which took office in february 1984. He pointed to the 3.3 pct growth in non-oil gdp in 1986 and to a \"moderate\" 12 pct inflation rate.     Lusinchi said the 20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling signed feb. 27 put an end to a process which had been \'the calvary of our nation over the post four years.\'     In the refinancing accord, he said, venezuela managed to achieve \'the most inmportant thing, which is the reopening of financial flows from abroad, essential for the financing of development and the (financing) of trade and investment.\'     Once all the details of the agreement are finalized, he said, venezuela will seek new financing for the imported components of new development projects.     \"our intention is not to continue being net exporters of capital, but to protect our balance of payments with a flow of capital towards venezuela,\" he said.     Under the agreement signed february 27, venezuela extended payments on the debt from 12 to 14 years, while the interest rate was lowered from 1 y 1/8 to 7/8 of a pct over libor.

The report, published today by the economic monthly, The Peru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcia\'s government in stimulating output last year to achieve a growth in gross domestic product of over eight pct \"represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long.\"     Government officials had no immediate comment on the report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment program and greater emphasis on the preservation of Peru\'s export potential.     The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation program was encountering rising difficulties.     \"An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls, appears not improbable,\" it added.     The world bank report said the government\'s policies had reduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption at the apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of the currency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses, and sharply diminished creditworthiness.     It said unless the government took action quickly to fix a competitive exchange rate and control the public sector deficit, \"the higher the probability will be that the government will eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment of domestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still further controls on imports in order to stem inflation and support the balance of payments.\"     It said the bank would place more emphasis on the preservation of peru\'s export potential, external links and overall economic efficiency.     The government\'s incentive policies towards the mining and petroleum sectors, among its main traditional exports, suggested that it did not accord high priority to their economic viability, it added.  \n',27
'Zimbabwe\'s real gross domestic product increased 0.2 pct in 1986, according to preliminary figures published by the Central Statistical Office (CSO). This contrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985.     The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth was a drop in the real value of agricultural output. This declined 12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previous year. Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturing production increased 1.4 pct.     The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 12.7 pct to 8.2 billion Zimbabwe dlrs, but inflation, measured by the GDP deflator, was estimated at 12.2 pct, so there was virtually no growth in real output during 1986.  \n',27

He said he was happy with \"a good result\" for February but stressed a need for continued \"vigilance\" against inflation.

'A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy.     But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct in 1986, is uncertain.     Forced last month to cut the government\'s 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out.     The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year.     France\'s economic performance, led by a mixed cast of right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed reviews from non-partisan analysts.     For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government\'s outstanding achievement has been to launch \"a veritable intellectual revolution\" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control.     \"The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad -- but set in their context of structural reforms, they are excellent,\" Develle said.     But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief architect of the government\'s free market policies, may be pursuing a mirage.     \"The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological\" said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval. \"Personally I think it\'s an illusion. Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system, from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.\"     Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard. Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks and industries to private investors.     Since December, nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas PARI.PA and glass maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA SGEP.PA, the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five-year privatisation plan.     Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since December.     At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.     The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or less.     \"But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945,\" commented Develle of Paribas.     Other achievements include a major reduction in the state\'s foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1 billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and down from 153.3 billion in 1985.     But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second since Chirac took power.     A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted.     Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology sectors, French industrial goods were \"increasingly ill-adapted to demand\" and over-priced, the report said.     French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed with the report. \"One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,\" he said.     And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment, the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7 million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.     The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.     French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last year\'s oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan, they say. ... \n',27
'Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of last week\'s earthquake which killed at least 300 people.     Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said in a televised address that the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet, would be reduced.     He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of petrol would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct. Petrol supplies would also be limited.     Information Ministry officials said the price freeze was aimed at protecting poor Ecuadoreans from a wave of specualtion. Violators would be severely punished, according to the price freeze order, signed by five cabinet ministers.     The items for which prices were frozen included rice, sugar, cooking oil, potatoes, salt, wheat flour, cigarettes, soft drinks, school supplies and several kinds of vegetables.

'France\'s right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year.     Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a 2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.     But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.     And bank economists contacted bys said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988.     \"The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,\" said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. \"We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year.\"     \"The big question is whether the government\'s policy of wage moderation will be maintained,\" he added.     The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity.     But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices.     Calling the government\'s policies \"unbalanced and unjust,\" he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training     Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of France\'s unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority.     But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.     \"Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that,\" commented Michel Develle, economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas.     Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he said.     Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.     \"But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed,\" he commented.     Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living costs.     But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.     Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long as the government kept wages under control.     Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute, INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better, he added.     Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit, several analysts said.     So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth, they said.      \n',27

The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986 cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.     The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the first part of 1987.

He said one potential channel for renewed inflationary pressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in the exchange markets, which would push import prices up sharply.     He said participants in financial markets and business remain skeptical of prospects for lasting price stability.     \"Should the skepticism about our ability to resist inflation be reinforced by bad policy, the consequences for interest rates, for exchange rates, and for the economy generally would clearly be undesirable...recognition of that danger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation of monetary policy,\" the Fed chairman said.

The consumer price index (base 1976) rose to 761.3 from 753.7 in January and compared with 695.4 in February 1986.     This gave a year-on-year February inflation rate of 9.5 pct against 9.8 pct in January and 12.6 pct in February 1986.     Measured as an annual average rate, inflation in February was 11.1 pct compared with 11.4 pct in January.  The government forecasts annual average inflation of about eight pct this year.  \n',27
'South African year-on-year consumer price inflation rose slightly to 16.3 pct in February after falling sharply to 16.1 pct in January from 18.1 pct in December, Central Statistics Office figures show.     The monthly rise in the all items index (base 1980) was 1.09 pct to 251.0 in February after a 1.4 pct increase to 248.3 in January.     A year ago the index stood at 215.8 and year on year consumer price inflation at 18.05 pct.  \n',27
'Spain\'s consumer price index rose 0.4 pct in February after increases of 0.7 pct the previous month and 0.4 pct in February last year, National Statistics Institute figures show.

'Sweden\'s rate of inflation during January has been revised downwards after a fault was made in calculating the figures, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.     The January rise in consumer prices was 1.0 pct instead of the previously announced 1.3 pct, the bureau said, without explaining how the error arose.     Consumer prices in February rose 0.3 pct compared with 0.1 pct in February last year, the bureau said. The total inflation rate so far this year is therefore 1.3 pct, allowing for January\'s revised figures, it added.     Year-on-year inflation rose to 3.4 pct in February, against a revised 3.2 pct in January and a year-on-year rate of 5.3 pct in February 1986, the bureau said.     The slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a government imposed price freeze which came into force on February 4, the bureau added.  \n',27
'Swiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987 and 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domestic economy, the Centre for Economic Research of the Federal Institute of Technology said in its spring review.     It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988 compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helped to keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct.     The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss economy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the more difficult international economic climate facing export industry.     The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in Swiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5 pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7 pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review.     Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the motor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986.     Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from 2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent years. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct.     The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has firmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure on Swiss exporters.     It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more modest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct.     Industrial production will grow by 1.6 pct in 1987 and 1.2 pct in 1988 compared with 4.2 pct in 1986.  \n',27
'Swiss consumer prices rose one pct in the year to March, the same rise as in the year to February, and against 0.9 pct in the year to March 1986, the Federal Statistics Office said.     In March alone, prices rose 0.1 pct after a 0.3 pct rise in February.     The March index, base 1982, was 109.7 against 109.5 in February.     The Statistics Office said the March increase reflected rises in certain sectors such as food, clothing and household goods and falls in transport, heating and lighting.     Both home produced and imported goods rose by 0.1 pct during the month. But over the year as a whole, domestically generated inflation reached 2.5 pct, offset by a 2.8 pct drop in imports.  \n',27
'Switzerland\'s economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said.     This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said.     The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.     The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year\'s sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.     But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area.     Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986.     The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years.     But \"given Switzerland\'s large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances,\" the OECD said.     Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted.     In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall GDP, it added.     The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said.     As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986.     But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange.     The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.     Particularly for the banks, \"recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position,\" it said.  \n',27
'Inflation in Turkey was 3.7 pct in March compared with 1.7 pct in February and 1.3 pct in March 1986, the State Statistics Institute said.     The annual rate rose to 34.7 pct in March compared with 31.7 pct in February and 34.2 pct in March 1986. The government\'s target is to reduce inflation this year to an annual 20 pct.

'The Retail Price Index (RPI), Britain\'s measure of inflation, rose 0.4 pct in February on a revised basis, to give a year-on-year rise of 3.9 pct, the Employment Department said.     In January, the index rose 0.4 pct for a 3.9 pct year-on-year rise on both the previous base and the new index.     The February RPI was set at 100.4, base January 1987. In February 1986, the RPI rose 0.4 pct, giving a 5.1 pct year-on-year increase on the old basis.     The inflation data compares with market forecasts for a rise of 0.4 - 0.5 pct in February and a yearly rise of about four pct, economists said.     The Employment Department said the rise in the index between January and February was mainly the result of higher prices for petrol, fresh vegetables, cars and car maintenance.  \n',27
'The U.K. Government tomorrow will release the first of its Retail Price Index (RPI) figures calculated on a revised group of components and rebased on January 1987, as previously announced, the Employment Department said.     The index, Britain\'s measure of inflation, is for February. Earlier data will not be revised as there are no equivalent figures including the new components, a spokesman said.     Previously, the RPI base was January, 1974.     Market forecasts centre on a 0.4-0.5 pct monthly rise in February and a year on year rate about 4.0 pct. The government forecasts annual inflation will be 4.0 pct at the end of 1987.  \n',27
'U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI-U), rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain, the Labor Department said.     The CPI for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) rose to 329.0 in February, the department said.     Prices for petroleum-based energy rose sharply for a second consecutive month during February but by less than in January, the department said.     Energy prices rose 1.9 pct last month after a 3.0 pct rise in January, accounting for one-third of the overall CPI rise.     For the 12 months ended in February, the CPI rose an unadjusted 2.1 pct.     Transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct increase in January. Smaller price rises for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges were responsible for the moderation.     Gasoline prices rose 4.2 pct last month after increasing 6.6 pct in January, but were still 18 pct below levels of a year ago, the department said.     Housing prices rose 0.4 pct in February after a 0.5 pct January increase, largely due to a rise in fuel oil prices.     Fuel oil prices were up 4.4 pct in February after increasing 9.8 pct in January, but were still 15 pct below price levels of February 1986.     Food prices rose 0.2 pct last month after a 0.5 pct January increase. Grocery store food prices were up 0.4 pct, the same as in January, but meat, poultry, fish and eggs cost less for a third consecutive month, the department said.     Medical care rose 0.3 pct in February to a level 7.1 pct above one year ago, because of higher costs for prescription and non-prescription drugs and medical supplies, the department said.     The index for apparel and upkeep rose 0.7 pct in February after a 0.4 pct increase in January. The department said the introduction of higher priced spring merchandise, particularly men\'s clothing, was responsible for the advance.     Prices for other goods and services rose 0.7 pct in February following a 1.1 pct increase in January. Tobacco prices, up 0.9 pct after a 2.0 pct January increase, accounted for 30 pct of the index rise, the department said.  \n',27
'Consumer energy costs rose 1.9 pct in February following a sharp rise last month, the Labor Department said.     The February increase in the overall energy costs, including petroleum, coal and natural gas, followed a 0.2 pct drop in December and a 3.0 pct rise in January, it said.     Energy prices were 12.2 pct below year-ago levels.     The department\'s Consumer Price Index showed that the cost of gasoline rose in February by 4.2 pct, after a 6.6 pct rise in January.     Gasoline prices were nonetheless 18.0 pct below their levels as of February 1986.     Also, the category including fuel oil, coal and bottled gas rose in February by 3.8 pct, putting it 14.9 pct under the year-ago figure.     The index also showed that natural gas and electricity were unchanged last month, but down 3.5 pct from the February 1986 figure, the department said.     The index has been updated  o reflect 1982-84 consumption patterns; previously, the index was based on 1972-73 patterns.  \n',27
'Latest consumer price data indicate U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be above last year\'s pace, economists said.     \"Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time last year, but it\'s not building up a large head of steam,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.     U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price index for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices, which fired January\'s data with a three pct rise, advanced a more moderate 1.9 pct last month.     The CPI came within the range of economists\' expectations and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.     Among the key components of the report, transportation prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and declines in new car prices and finance charges.     \"There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.     Economists said the latest CPI supports existing expectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.     The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986. Without last year\'s energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.     Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a result of the dollar\'s drop as well as the volatile energy component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become factored into the wider economic picture.     \"As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct inflation,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.  \n',27

'Momentum in th U.S. economy may be picking up given solid across-the board increases in the February U.S. employment report, economists said.     U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February, twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a 319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 448,000 increase.     \"Even if you look at January and February together, this is still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in the market,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.     Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much larger gains in February U.S. production and income than previously forecast.     The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from 34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose 0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since November 1966, the Commerce Department said.     \"The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7 pct,\" said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4 pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.     Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour in February from 8.83 dlrs in January.     \"Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means we\'ll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis the wage and salary disbursement,\" he said.     Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.     He said the February employment gains are consistent with his firm\'s first quarter U.S. real gross national product growth forecast of 3.7 pct.     Economists agreed that the employment data were negative for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy and no easing in the Federal Reserve\'s monetary policy. But most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.     \"This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider easing,\" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.     \"It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,\" he said. \"If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so, but it\'s most likely they\'ll sit and wait.\"     \"The data have not been uniform,\" Stone added. \"Durable goods were weak in January and now employment is strong.\"     In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct, followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S. retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap widened to 14.8 billion dlrs.     \"Things just aren\'t adding up,\" said Steve Slifer of Lehman Goverment Securities Inc. \"Consumer spending, capital spending, goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first quarter GNP growth of one pct,\" he said.     \"The employment and production data point to a big inventory build-up, but that\'s what we thought in the fourth quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.\"     Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000 in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery industries returning to work.     Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains have resulted from an improving trade outlook.     Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S. trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve in the first quarter.     \"Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter, but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show that trade is improving,\" Benderley said.     \"The economy is moving between extremes,\" he said. \"Some reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.\"     A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater part of February\'s employment gain. Retail services employment rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in January, previously reported at 166,000.     Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 142,000 gain.     The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at 6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since March 1980, the Commerce Department noted.     \"The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,\" Carson said. \"This takes away the Fed\'s flexibility to ease, but there\'s no reason to tighten. It\'s way too early for that.\"         \n',27

'The government announced a three billion franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation among political and economic analysts that it is positioning itself for a period of economic reflation.     The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe Seguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc contingency fund announced on February 25.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a reflationary program.     Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third of French unemployed, government figures show.     The main measures of the employment program give employers financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term unemployed return to the labour market.     Training subsidies and exemptions from social security contributions are the main incentives for employers.     \"Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour market and that\'s why the proposals...Are costly,\" an aide to Seguin said.     The analysts said speculation the government is considering a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.     He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out economic stimulation despite the government\'s revision of its 1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.     Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin\'s remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate the economy through a boost to consumer spending although government policy allowed for increased industrial investment from the proceeds of France\'s five-year privatisation plan.     The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt and providing state enterprises with fresh capital.     Some political analysts said Baudouin\'s comments possibly reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on social issues ahead of next year\'s presidential elections.      Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with labour.      Officials said that after the success of the privatisation of Cie de Saint Gobain SGEP.PA and Cie Financiere de Paribas PARI.PA the government had decided to speed up its five-year privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in 1988.     The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted revenue to boost industrial and research investment and spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway network.    The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by improving the competitiveness of French industry.     The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of State.  \n',27
'The 1992 deadline for abolishing economic barriers within the European Community should help French economic growth and create jobs, president of the French employers\' federation CNPF Francois Perigot said.     \"Having a market at our disposal which is as homogeneous and accessible as that of Europe is an incredible piece of luck,\" he told Le Figaro in an interview.     He said that the majority of French business leaders were enthusiastic about the abolition of barriers and saw it as an opportunity rather than a danger for their companies.     \"It can permit us to return to a growth rate which is much better than we could achieve in isolation.

Prime Minister Jacques Chirac told a television interviewer, \"As soon as the law is approved, and it will be in a matter of weeks, all workers made redundant will have the right to social benefits.\"     The money, which will be used to alleviate unemployment through retraining or project finance, will come from a 7.5 billion franc government fund set up last month to finance spending on special areas of concern.     Apart from unemployment, these include relief to farmers hit by European Community cost-cutting measures.     French unemployment has risen by more than 40 pct from 1.8 mln when socialist President Francois Mitterrand took office in 1981.  \n',27
'West German unemployment, unadjusted for seasonal factors, fell to 2.41 mln in March from 2.49 mln in February, the Federal Labour Office said.     The total represents 9.6 pct of the workforce compared with 10.0 pct in February.     The seasonally adjusted jobless total rose, however, in March to 2.23 mln from 2.18 mln in February, it added.     In March last year the unadjusted unemployment total stood at 2.45 mln and represented 9.8 pct of the workforce. Seasonally adjusted unemployment was 2.29 mln.     The Federal Labour Office said the number of workers on short time rose by 80,629 to 462,802 and the number of vacancies increased by 15,263 to 180,047.     Labour Office President Heinrich Franke, announcing the figures, said the hesitant decline in the unadjusted jobless total reflected continuing bad weather, slack activity in the capital goods sector and structural changes in the coal and steel industry.     In a separate statement, the Federal Statistics Office said the rise in the overall number of people in employment had slowed in February.     The Office said that, according to estimates for February, 25.7 mln people were in work, a rise of around 240,000 or 0.9 pct compared with the same month in 1986.     It noted that in January the year-on-year rise was 250,000 or 1.0 pct and the number in work stood at 25.78 mln. The decline in February compared with January reflected seasonal factors, it added.  \n',27
'Japan\'s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 2.9 pct in February from the record 3.0 pct in January, the government\'s Management and Coordination Agency said.     The January level was the worst since the Goverment started compiling unemployment statistics under the current system in 1953.     Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.     Unadjusted February unemployment totalled 1.86 mln people, up from 1.82 mln in January and 1.64 mln a year earlier.     Male unemployment in February remained at 2.9 pct, equal to the second-highest level set in January and December. Record male unemployment of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986.     Female unemployment rose to a record 3.1 pct in February from the previous record 3.0 pct marked in January 1987 and in April, August, September and December last year.     \"Japan\'s employment condition was still severe in February as the non-rounded rate of unemployment in February fell only 0.03 percentage points to 2.93 pct from 2.96 pct in January,\" an agency official said.     Employment in manufacturing industries fell 430,000 from a year earlier to 14.22 mln people in February due to the yen\'s continued appreciation, while employment in non-manufacturing industries rose 380,000 to 12.11 mln.     In manufacturing industries, employment in the textile industry fell 180,000 to 1.94 mln in February, while in ordinary and precision machinery industries it fell 160,000 to 1.50 mln.  \n',27

Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.     Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people, up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier.     Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct, equal to the second-worst level set last December. Record male unemployement of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986.     Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct, equal to the record level marked in April, August, September and December last year.     January\'s record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly in export-related firms, due to the yen\'s continuing appreciation against the dollar, officials said.     Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from a year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the textile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06 mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders, down 170,000.  \n',27
'Japan\'s unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January\'s three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.     December\'s 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government\'s Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953.     \"There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment,\" said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.     The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions.     \"At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving,\" a Labour Ministry official said.     Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.     Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.     The yen\'s surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said.     Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd\'s economics department.     However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years.  \n',27
'Treasurer Paul Keating forecast economic growth at slightly under two pct in the financial year ending June this year, down from the 2.25 pct forecast contained in the 1986/87 budget delivered last August.

Despite the figures, the budget forecast of about 1.75 pct annual growth in employment would be met, Keating said.     Unemployment is currently at 8.2 pct of the workforce.     \"This government is dragging Australia through a trading holocaust the kind of which we have not seen since the Second World War,\" Keating said.     \"We are not pushing this place into a recession.

'A new method of calculating Sweden\'s unemployment figures reduced the number of jobless by a sixth, a spokesman for the Central Bureau of Statistics (SCB) said, reporting a substantial drop in the past year.     According to the revised data there were 94,000 jobless in February representing 2.2 pct of the workforce against 120,000 or 2.8 pct of the workforce in February 1986.     SCB official Olle Wessberg said the new figures were based on a more extensive survey of the unemployed which brought Sweden into line with the practises recommended by the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation.     Wessberg said the new method cut the number of unemployed by about 16 pct. \"The way we are now collecting data is far more accurate and we are asking many more questions to find out whether the jobless want work, whether they are able to work and whether they have actually looked for work,\" he tolds.     The new method was first used for the January figures, which showed unemployment dropping to 2.1 pct of the workforce from 2.7 pct (old style) in December, but Wessberg said the change had apparently not been noticed by the press.     Recalculated according to the new method, unemployment in February 1986 would have stood at 2.2 pct, the SCB said.  \n',27

In January, seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by a revised 1,100 to 11.3 pct, it said. Initially the January position was reported as flat.     The unadjusted jobless total, including school leavers, fell to 3.23 mln, or 11.7 pct, from 3.30 mln, 11.9 pct, in January.     February was the seventh successive month that seasonally adjusted unemployment registered a fall.     It was at a peak of 11.7 pct last summer.     Lord Young, the Employment Minister, said there appeared little doubt the monthly fall, which has been running at about 20,000, will continue.

The number of non-farm payroll jobs rose 164,000 last month after rising a revised 236,000 in February. That was down from the previously reported 337,000 rise in February.     The March unemployment rate was the lowest since March, 1980. It had remained unchanged at 6.7 pct for three straight months before the March decline.

Construction employment also lowered the number of jobs in the goods-producing sector, falling by 45,000 after seasonal adjustment, the department said.     Mining employment was little changed in March and has not experienced any substantial erosion since the rapid job losses in oil and gas drilling in the first two-thirds of 1986.

'Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said the central bank was worried that money supply was growing too fast, reflecting excessive internal demand in the Spanish economy, but added that he was confident recent measures would succeed in restricting money growth.     In testimony to the economic commission of Congress, Rubio said the main measure of money supply, the broad-based Liquid Assets in Public Hands, grew at an estimated annualised rate of 17 pct in March, the same as in February.     The bank\'s target range for growth in this measure in 1987 is 6.5 to 9.5 pct, compared with 11.4 pct last year.     Rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range.     He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was due to a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pct real drop in the contribution of the external sector.     The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but a drop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negative component of the external sector trimmed to 1.5 pct, he said.  \n',27

'Bundesbank council member Lothar Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates.     Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy.     The article followed international press speculation that the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy.     Mueller, a member of the Bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria, noted that the Bundesbank\'s decision in January to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting.     \"Simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy,\" he explained.     Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation. The Bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down.     Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials, also encouraged investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller said.     The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path, he said.     \"Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this quiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months,\" he added.     \"All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite suppositions to the contrary,\" Mueller said.     \"Keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates, especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than growth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non-banks,\" Mueller said.     Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy.     Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate.     In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S. Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said.     But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank.     Even interest rates are not in the centre of the Bundesbank\'s considerations, but reflect competition and other market conditions, Mueller said.     A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock, the Bundesbank\'s main money supply indicator.     This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity of industry and households which cannot be directly reached with the Bundesbank\'s instruments, Mueller said.     The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the harder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been the case recently, because non-banks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports.     \"If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows,\" he said.     Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high.     In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter.     The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said.     But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities. \"Monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy -- nothing else,\" he said.  \n',27

In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC said that \"somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets.\"     The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president favored some tightening of reserve conditions.     He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November through January and the firm federal funds rate that had prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He also cited the recent declines in the dollar\'s value.     Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed that prompt restraints might avert the need for more substantial tightening later.     Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC minutes showed, \"the members generally felt that policy implementation should be especially alert to the potential need for some firming of reserve conditions.\"     In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in line with current expectations and there were concurrent indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the background of stronger economic data.     One indication of potential price pressure might be a further tendency for the dollar to weaken.     The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer, preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing during the weeks ahead. However, \"most of the members did not want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the conditions for such a move as likely to emerge.\"     The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the dollar\'s value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any significant effect on the Fed\'s economic projections. In addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be made in reducing the federal budget deficit.  \n',27
'U.S. bank reserve, monetary and discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve today clearly indicate that policy is \"on hold\" and may not be changed for weeks or even months, economists said.     \"The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy,\" said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co.     \"These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change,\" said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc.     Fed data released today were all in line with economists\' expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks.     The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln dlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that.     It said that banks\' net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously.     Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6 billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs.     Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3 pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actual positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3.     February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and 20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target.     \"In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money growth,\" said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc.     Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in March after February\'s anemic growth rates. However, they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness.     Commenting on February\'s decline in the key M-2 aggregate, Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February\'s weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2 and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March.     Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the Fed.     Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves.     Given the economy\'s fragility in many sectors, the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next changes policy.     \"Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six pct,\" said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week.     The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added reserves directly through two-day System repurchases.     Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate be largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs.  \n',27
'Federal Reserve data released today indicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks and that none is likely at next week\'s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, economists said.     \"The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of reserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since the beginning of this year,\" said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.     \"These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not change policy,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.     \"The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There\'s no real reason for it to change policy,\" said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.     Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.     All of the economists agreed that the Fed\'s major concern now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was heavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering interest rates further.     Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with expectations and similar to the data for most of this year.     The Fed said that banks\' net free reserves averaged 603 mln dlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.     In the single week to Wednesday, banks\' borrowings at the discount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement period. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to 6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.     The Fed\'s failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.     The Fed\'s absence may be explained by the lack of any pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.     Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week borrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.     Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for two-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of around 6.10 pct.     It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said Wells Fargo\'s Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to 6-1/4 pct band.     Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need are anticipated for the statement period that began today.  More     Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.     To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar coupon \"pass\" may be required later.     There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.  \n',27
'Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.     \"The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed,\" said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.     Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed\'s policy \"has been unchanged up to today.\"     Although Volcker\'s statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today\'s data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.     This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed\'s decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added.     Today\'s data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.     \"The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday,\" said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. \"But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous.\"     \"The Fed couldn\'t have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections,\" added Security Pacific\'s Bannon.     A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.     Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed\'s discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists\' forecasts of about 200 mln.     For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period.     \"There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings,\" said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.     Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said.     \"For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,\" said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. \"I expect it to continue in that vein.\"     \"Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs,\" added First Chicago\'s Johnson. Banks\' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.     After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16.     Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar\'s progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.     \"The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar\'s effect on Fed policy,\" said First Chicago\'s Johnson. \"Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won\'t pull back from easing.\"  \n',27
'Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the U.S. banking system is flush with reserves going into a period of traditional tightness and that overall monetary policy is on hold, economists said.     \"There is ample liquidity.... The Fed is not going to shift gears at the present time or for at least another month,\" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.     \"Technical and seasonal considerations aside, there is nothing for the (credit) market to get excited about,\" added Robert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc.     Adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed\'s discount window averaged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bank statement period ending next Wednesday, compared with 233 mln and 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods.     Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revision in banks\' net free reserves in the two-week period to March 11 to a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln.     Finally, a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14 money center banks were absent from the Fed\'s discount window for the third week running, with the latest week\'s borrowing split between the large regional and the smaller banks.     While modest open market intervention was apparently enough to defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the latest statement period, economists predicted that the Fed would have to be more aggressive in coming weeks.     The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectly on four of the five trading days via system and customer repurchase agreements.     \"Fed funds will be coming under relatively intense pressure,\" said Salomon\'s di Clemente, noting the approaching month- and quarter-end and the round of holidays and tax dates in April.     \"The Fed is faced with a large seasonal adding requirement,\" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc, who expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a coupon purchase in early April.     Economists were also heartened by further signs of a deceleration in money supply growth, not only in the largely discredited M-1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M-2 and M-3 aggregates.     M-1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine, compared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise. Weekly M-2 and M-3 components also hinted at slower overall growth.     \"The M-1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect we are on our way to another moderate set of M-2 and M-3 figures for March,\" said Salomon\'s di Clemente. Merrill\'s McCarthy said they could even come in below the bottom of their respective target ranges.     In February, M-2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upper limit and M-3 was 20.8 billion beneath.     Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnson\'s encouraging remarks on inflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas, some economists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lend support to calls for further accommodation here.     \"Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards in rates before anything else,\" said Salomon\'s di Clemente, adding that the key swing factor will continue to be the strength of the U.S. economy.     Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economy\'s health would remain the main influence on policy but, contrary to di Clemente, he said that recent signs of faster growth and inflation could lead to higher rates first.     Drexel\'s Ramirez did not commit herself either way, adding that the next major move may have to wait until April 14 when February\'s U.S. trade data are due for release.  \n',27
'The Federal Reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to supply temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase agreements, economists said.     They said the Fed is expected to execute anywhere from 1.5-2.0 billion dlrs of customer repos to offset seasonal pressures on bank reserves.     Federal funds, which averaged 6.20 pct yesterday, opened at 6-1/8 pct and remained there in early trading.      \n',27
'French money supply, measured in terms of M-3, rose a provisional one pct in January after falling 0.7 pct in December, the Bank of France said.     M-3 is the main money supply aggregate used by the French monetary authorities. It has been joined as a second main money supply aggregate for 1987 by M-2, which rose a provisional 1.2 pct in January after falling a confirmed 0.9 pct in December.     Calculated on a three-month moving average basis, M-3 rose 4.4 pct year-on-year in the quarter based on December after rising 5.4 pct in the quarter centred on September.     The M-2 aggregate, centred on a three-month moving average, rose year-on-year by four pct, within a 1987 target range of four to six pct.     M-1 rose 2.5 pct after a 1.1 pct fall in December. M-1 measures notes and coins in circulation plus sight deposits.     M-2 adds in short-term bank deposits and M-3 adds in other short-term deposits.     The central bank\'s widest measure of liquidity, L, rose 1.5 pct in January after one pct fall in December. The bank said the money supply growth reflected a net increase of sight deposits and renewed interest in money market instruments.  \n',27
'West Germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks on the February capital account, combining long and short term capital flows, compared with a net inflow of 11.91 billion marks in January, the Bundesbank said.

'Cash in circulation in West Germany rose by 2.8 billion marks in the last week of February to 121.5 billion, a gain of 8.3 pct over the same month last year, the Bundesbank said.     Cash in circulation is one of two components of the West German money supply which the German central bank is targeting to grow between three and six pct this year.     Gross currency reserves in the week rose by 200 mln marks to 109.5 billion. Foreign liabilities fell 100 mln to 22.9 billion, giving a net currency reserves increase of 300 mln to 86.6 billion.     Commercial bank minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank fell 300 mln marks to 51.9 billion marks at the end of February, averaging 51.2 billion over the month.     The rediscount debt of the banking system fell 800 mln marks to 55.2 billion marks, the Bundesbank said.     Banks made heavy use of the Lombard emergency funding facility to meet month-end payments and borrowed 3.1 billion marks, a rise of 2.9 billion over the week before.     The net position of public authorities at the Bundesbank declined 6.7 billion marks in the last week of February.     The federal government drew down 3.8 billion marks of its Bundesbank cash deposits, which had stood at 4.1 billion in the third week of February, and also borrowed a 1.8 billion in credit from the central bank.     Federal states\' deposits fell 1.5 billion marks to 1.3 billion and their cash credits dropped 400 mln to 300 mln.     The Bundesbank balance sheet total rose around 5.44 billion to 222.22 billion marks.  \n',27
'West German central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct reported in January, provisional data from the Bundesbank showed.     The figure was thus outside the three to six pct range set by the Bundesbank for 1987.     In absolute terms, the measure rose to 223.2 billion marks in February from 221.8 billion in the prior month.     The data showed that the stock grew at an annualized 8.6 pct over the six months to February, slower than the 9.4 pct rise in the same period to January.     Of the two components comprising central bank money stock, cash in circulation rose to 111.7 billion marks in February from 110.9 billion in January, the Bundesbank data showed.     This gave an annualized 8.3 pct rise over the six months to February, down from a 10.2 pct increase over the six months to January.     Minimum reserve requirements on domestic liabilities grew to 111.5 billion marks in February from 110.9 billion in January.     This yielded an annualized 8.8 pct rise over the six month to February, up slightly from an 8.6 pct increase over the same period to January.  \n',27
'West German M3 money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 2.6 billion marks in February to 1,035.1 billion, the Bundesbank said.     The rise compares with a revised 14.8 billion mark increase in January and a 2.2 billion rise in February 1986.  \n',27
'West Germany\'s money supply growth slowed in February after January\'s sharp rise but the trend is still definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement.     Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was only moderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits with statutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply, short-term time deposits fell after expanding unusually strongly in January.     In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdings of German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January.     Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct.     In the six months to February, M2, which excludes time deposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cash and sight deposits, rose seven pct.     International transactions of non-banks again led to a significant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said.     Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against foreigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1 billion marks in February, little changed from January\'s rise.     But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of the inflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary effect on money growth, the Bundesbank said.     Outstanding bank credits to companies and private individuals remained virtually unchanged in February.     A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflected the foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise in long-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities.     At the end of February total bank credits to the private sector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level.     The effect of public authority cash movements on the money supply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said.     Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority paper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercial banks and the Bundesbank.     Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money supply growth to a larger extent than in January.     A total of 7.7 billion marks in long-term funds was placed with banks after 6.6 billion the previous month.  \n',27

'India\'s credit policy package for fiscal 1987/88 (April-March) will help ease inflationary pressures and control the growth of overall liqudity, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in a statement.     The package, announced earlier this week, will raise commercial bank statutory liquidity ratios to 37.5 pct from 37 pct, effective April 25, and will increase cash reserve ratios on foreign currency (non-resident) accounts to 9.5 pct from three pct, effective May 23, it said.

'Monetary and credit growth rates in New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels following the Reserve Bank\'s move to tighten liquidity late last year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said.     The monetary and credit growth figures for the December quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short term money market, Russell said in a statement.

The bank official said commercial bank reserves were 22.19 billion pesos at the end of December, when reserves required were 21.59 billion.     She said the surplus of 597 mln pesos, compared with a deficit of 390 mln pesos a month earlier and a deficit of 1.64 billion at the end of 1985, reflected political uncertainty in the last quarter of 1986.

'The Bank of Spain has extended the reserve requirement for banks to their convertible peseta funds in an attempt to curb speculation in short-term capital which is currently fuelling money supply growth.     In a statement issued late last night, the central bank said convertible peseta accounts, funds which are not subject to exchange controls, would also be subject to a 19 pct reserve requirement with effect from Friday.     Convertible peseta funds had been previously exempt from reserve requirements.     The measure comes one week after the central bank raised reserve requirements on domestic deposits by one percentage point to 19 pct, also with effect on Friday.     Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- have attracted a large influx of speculative foreign capital which is threatening the government\'s monetary targets.     They say this influx is largely responsible for Spain\'s principal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP), to have grown by an estimated 17 pct annualised rate in February, compared with January\'s 8.3 pct rise and an 11.4 pct rise during the whole of 1986. The target for 1987 is eight pct.     The Bank of Spain today did not provide assistance funds to banks in a move to drain excess liquidity from the money market. Liquidity will be further tightened by the fortnightly Treasury Bill auction tomorrow and Friday\'s hike in reserve requirements, expected to absorb over 200 billion pesetas from the system.     The immediate reaction was a hike in interbank interest rates today to 13.75/14.00 pct from yesterday\'s 13.46 pct average for deposits.     Bank of Spain officials said this was an understandable response \"given that the market is short of funds.\"     But banking sources noted that a continued rise in interest rates would neutralize the central bank\'s attempts to curtail short-term speculation with foreign funds by making the Spanish money markets more attractive.  \n',27
'The Bank of Spain said it raised the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened money supply and inflation targets.     In a statement issued late last night, the central bank said the measure would take effect from March 13.     \"In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the monetary and inflation targets set by the government,\" the statement said.     Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200 billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve requirement allowed by law is 20 pct.     The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the Bank of Spain\'s key overnight call money rate, which now stands at 13.5 pct. At today\'s auction, however, the bank left the rate unchanged.     Spain\'s principal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of 8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of 1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987.     Banking sources said that although the January money supply figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared to have accelerated in February, raising government concern.     Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that prices were under control.     Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from six pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during 1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.  \n',27

'Clearing bank sterling lending to the U.K. Private sector in February is estimated to have risen by an underlying, seasonally-adjusted 1.6 billion stg after a 1.2 billion stg rise in January, the Banking Information Service said.     The unadjusted rise was 1.31 billion stg, compared with an 813 mln stg increase in January.     The Banking Information Service said the adjusted rise of 1.6 billion stg was well above the recent monthly average of about 1.0 billion stg.     Of the increase, 297 mln stg was accounted for by personal lending, which the Banking Information Service said was taken up entirely by lending for home purchases.

Lending to the manufacturing industry was up 370 mln stg, and to leasing companies by 308 mln stg.

'Slower than expected growth in Britain\'s narrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur a further cut in U.K. Interest rates if a surge in sterling\'s value requires such a move, economic analysts said.     M0, the only targeted money supply measure left after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the official target for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budget speech on Tuesday, fell an adjusted 3/4 to one pct in February.     On an annual basis, this put M0 growth at four to 4-1/2 pct, in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct.     \"The M0 data are much better than we expected,\" said Robert Thomas, economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities.     He and other analysts said while the better than expected M0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a new interest rate cut, they removed an obstacle to such a move.     Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despite buoyant retail sales in February, advancing an adjusted 2.2 pct after a fall of the same size in January.     Analysts said the M0 measure, reflecting variations in consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects, was not an adequate indicator to determine interest rates.     \"The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 is important ... In practice, it is likely to be the exchange rate and the election which call the tune,\" Lloyds Merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment.     Richard Jeffrey, economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett, said in a comment: \"It is unlikely that (Lawson) will respond to signals from M0 alone ... Reinforcement from exchange rate trends is necessary before action is taken.\"     \"With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are made in response to signals from this narrow money variable, the City has been forced to take it seriously,\" he added.     Noting this point, Thomas said market fears at the end of last year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared.     This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U.K. Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the pound above unofficial targets, analysts said.     Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed between finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada at their Paris meeting last month, they added.   U.K. Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since the Paris agreement, once on March 11, and again yesterday when foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cut in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget.     They stand at 10 pct now, and foreign exchange dealers and analysts expect them to shed another half-point in the coming week.     Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher than expected increase in February sterling M3, which pushed the annual growth rate to almost 19 pct, well above the previous target of 11 to 15 pct.     Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate the improvement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past few months had been reversed, but firm conclusions could only be drawn after revised data are released on March 31.     Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to watch the sterling M3 target, and Lawson\'s move to scrap it altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its credibility as a key factor in monetary policy.  \n',27
'U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 228 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday March 18, the Federal Reserve said.     Total borrowings in the week rose 83 mln dlrs to 502 mln dlrs, with extended credits up three mln dlrs at 274 mln dlrs. The week was the first half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowing in the prior week averaged 148 mln dlrs.     Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on March 11, the Fed estimated that banks had daily average net free reserves of 759 mln dlrs rather than the 660 mln dlrs first reported.     A Fed spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed\'s reserve projections in the first week of the latest bank statement period.     None of the 14 large money center banks borrowed from the discount window during the week and all of the Wednesday borrowing was made by the smallest banks. For the week as a whole, the borrowing was split roughly evenly between the large regionals and the small banks.     Natural float ranged from a low of near zero on Thursday -- for which the Fed spokesman could give no particular reason -- to a high of nearly 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday.     The Tuesday peak included about 100 mln dlrs of transportation float in mid- and south-Atlantic states. Noting that the weather was \"basically good\" for March, the spokesman said that transportation float averaged under 500 mln dlrs a day for the full week.     Float related as-ofs were a negative 400 mln dlrs on Wenesday due to a number of unrelated cash letter error corrections in five districts.     As-ofs peaked at just over 500 mln dlrs on Tuesday.  \n',27
'U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.     The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131 mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs.     Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.     A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed\'s reserve projections in the week to Wednesday.     He said that natural float had been \"acting a bit strangely\" for this time of year, noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week.     The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.     The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday\'s high float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday\'s float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts.     For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of adjustments were \"small,\" adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country.     The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days.     However, he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact.     During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions.     On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks.     The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole.     For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at the smallest banks.  \n',27

'U.S. money supply growth is slowing down rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the Federal Reserve\'s main monetary aggregates may even have contracted in February.     A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the Fed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid growth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy was justified on account of weakness in the economy.         M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported today, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs. The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.     M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3. With other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit accounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is set for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.     M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of falling interest rates and banking deregulation.     But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is likely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.     \"The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they\'re all sending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows at the Fed,\" McCarthy said.     Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, \"We have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It\'s coming in a lot weaker than I thought.\"         The economists were quick to caution that one month\'s data prove nothing, especially because money growth previously had been so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct rate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.     Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a slowdown in the business expansion.     But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.     McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter progresses. \"Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as they were a month ago,\" he noted.     He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.     Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct or less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national product for the first quarter proved to be weak. \"You\'d certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past.\"     There was certainly nothing in the Fed\'s latest balance sheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under way, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.     Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to solve America\'s most urgent economic problem, its massive trade deficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to close the trade gap, Brusca said \"I\'m not prepared to be all that optimistic about the bond market.\"  \n',27
'Philippines Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community (EC) proposed a levy on vegetable oils.     Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted.     He said the EC not only ignored Manila\'s request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but proposed a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries.     Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers, he noted that \"I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value.\"     He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services.     \"The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed,\" he said.  \n',27

He said trade last year totalled 1.3 billion dlrs versus 700 mln dlrs in 1985.     The accord provided for capital goods trade between the two countries to rise to 2.0 billion dlrs over four years.

'Australia accused the U.S. of increasing protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to Washington\'s special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules on agricultural trade.     Robert Arnott, Australia\'s delegate to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.     \"Australia today said the United States\' goals of reducing U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by actions which in fact increased protection in trade in agriculture,\" the Australian delegation said in a statement.     \"The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture,\" Arnott told the meeting.     Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a justification for \"dubious protective measures\" by the U.S. He listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to close the U.S. sugar market to imports.     He also tolds the waiver allowed Washington to impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic support programs. This covered imports of dairy products, peanuts, cotton and sugar.     Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the GATT, tolds: \"These charges have been made since the very beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural policy, part of our law when we joined the GATT\".     \"We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with their programs. We can negotiate them all,\" Samuels added.     Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September. Bargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking, tourism, insurance) is included for the first time as well as manufactured goods.  \n',27
'The strong contribution of exports to the growth in Australia\'s gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of the data, private economists polled bys said.     Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, after rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a year earlier.     Equally significant was the decline in both private and government spending, they said.     Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth quarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureau figures show. Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and government spending by 0.2.     Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd said the government\'s aim of reducing the current account deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut imports appeared to be working.     However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keep growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports would increase and worsen the balance of payments.     Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the result was positive because growth was export-driven.     But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the growth in exports disclosed in other statistics.     The economists\' comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul Keating in a statement issued in Canberra.     Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a reduction in the current account deficit, notably the decline in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports.     A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter underscored the need to continue restraint in wages, prices and public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia\'s competitiveness, he said.     \"It is clear that through the continued application of that strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth pattern,\" he added.  \n',27
'Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reform it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis.     In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing abilities of a number of developing countries.      He said major countries should be showing leadership on this problem.     \"We will be giving close attention to the processes in the OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) and elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to agricultural trade reform,\" Dawkins said.     The Venice summit is scheduled for June.     He said Australia\'s interests in the Uruguay Round, the eighth under the GATT, are wide ranging. Dawkins said he sees the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore confidence in the multilateral system.     Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, but it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these processes.     \"We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on standstill and rollback are carried into practice.\"     The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years, he said.  \n',27

Under such circumstances, the countries agreed their currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.

'The United States and Japan will soon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors, U.S. Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige said on television.

He added: \"I do not think there will be a trade war at all.\"     On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17, because of Tokyo\'s failure to observe the agreement.     The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as Japan started adhering to the agreement. But they said there was little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the higher tariffs.

Asked after his testimony if this meant the United States would close its markets to Japan if they did not open theirs, Baldrige said, \"I\'m not prepared to say that, but it certainly would be one of the alternatives studied.\"     Baldrige said in his testimony Japan had a closed supercomputer market and a restricted telecommunications market.     \"I can only conclude that the common objective of the Japanese government and industry is to dominate the world electronics market. Given the importance of this market to U.S. industry in general and our defense base in particular, we cannot stand by idly,\" he said.

'Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the United States would go ahead with planned 300 mln dlr sanctions against Japanese semiconductor exports, despite any U.S. Japanese talks to avert the trade curbs.     He said in a speech to an export-import group that he was sure the United States and Japan could work out their dispute over unfair Japanese trade practices in semiconductor trade, but \"I am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out.\"     Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17.     He also said he did not think there would be a trade war with Japan, because Japan had too much value in exports to the United States to risk such a war.     \"Those fears are unfounded,\" he said.     He told reporters later that the sharp drop in the securities market was not due to fears of a trade war, but fear of inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact.     Market reaction was also due, he said, to the drop in the value of the dollar, although trade issues did have some effect.     Baldrige said that observers who were attributing the drop in the market to trade sanctions were \"barking up the wrong tree.\"     He said the market observers will realize this shortly.     Baldrige said his remarks did not mean to suggest anything about the market or the exchange rate of the dollar.  \n',27
'Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the U.S. trade deficit should start to decline soon, possibly in the figures for February or March.     \"We could see the trade deficit start down in February or March,\" Baldrige said in an appearance before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.     He predicted the trade deficit, which was 170 billion dlrs in 1986, would decline by 30 to 40 billion dlrs in 1987 and in 1988.     Baldrige said he was making his prediction without having seen the February trade figures, but he said that the volume of imports has dropped beginning with the fourth quarter of 1986 and will continue to drop in this quarter.     The eventual turnaround in the monthly trade figures will reflect the impact of the decline in the dollar, Baldrige said.     Ealier, Treasury Secretary James Baker told the committee that the trade deficit had levelled off, but Baldrige said he was more optimistic, adding, \"I think we turned the corner in February.\"  \n',27
'Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrialized countries (NICS) to revalue currencies that are tied to the dollar in order to help the United States cut its massive trade deficit.     \"We do need to do something with those currencies or we will be substituting Japanese products for Taiwanese products,\" or those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar, Baldrige told a House banking subcommittee.     The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen and European currencies, but has changed very little against the currencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and Taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar.     As a result, efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over the past year and a half have done little to improve the trade deficits with those countries.     Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that the Treasury Department was attempting to persuade those countries to reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates.   \n',27
'U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade bill this year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompt a trade war.     \"The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as I\'ve ever seen it in six years in Washington,\" Baldrige said in a weekend television interview.     \"I think we\'ll still be able to get a reasonable trade bill out in spite of that because the whole Congress is trying to work together with the administration, but there is a hardening trade attitude,\" he said.     President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation but agreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that opposition Democrats would pass such legislation.     However, Baldrige warned measures that would penalize trading partners such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan for failing to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. could lead to retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto any such bill.     When asked if there is a rising danger of a worldwide trade war, Baldrige said: \"Yes, I don\'t think there\'s any question about that.\"  \n',27

A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President weakened by the Iran scandal.     De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, \"the only way we could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems.\"     He said if a textile bill was enacted, \"we will impose taxes on a lot of American products.\"  He said \"it would be stupid. We have to avoid that.\"     He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted  shipments of Asian textiles.     De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve EC trade issues, saying \"each time we come in contact, it a conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West.\"     He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross the Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.     \"This is not the way to work in a serious way between two big powers,\" De Croo said.      \n',27
'The Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) moved into a narrow trade surplus of 4.7 billion francs in 1986 after a 140.4 billion franc deficit in 1985, figures given by a spokesman for the National Statistics Institute show.     He said imports fell last year to 3,061.8 billion francs from 3,304.1 in 1985 while exports were also lower at 3,066.6 billion francs against 3,163.7 billion.

'inflation plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.     Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country\'s 250 pct inflation rate.     But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.     \"The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was inflation, at least the economy worked,\" a leading bank economist said.     The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and 1985 Brazil\'s annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.     For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged under 150 mln.  \n',27
'Brazilian Science and Technology Minister Renato Archer said Brazil will keep its computer market closed to foreign goods in order to give its own infant industry time to develop.     \"Every country establishes laws to protect its interests. The United States closed their borders at a certain stage to some foreign goods and therefore protected its industrial development. Now it is time for Brazil to do likewise,\" Archer said at the opening of a national software conference.     After several meetings, Brazil and the U.S. Have made no major progress in their computer row, which they have been trying to resolve for the past 18 months.     The Reagan administration has objected to Brazil protecting its computer industry from imports.  \n',27
'Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said his country\'s foreign debt crisis could only be solved by changes in the international financial system.     Speaking to a business conference he said \"It is not Brazil that has to make adjustments with the IMF (International Monetary Fund). It is the international financial community that is taking away resources from the developing countries.\"     \"The crisis is not in Brazil, a country that has had the third biggest trade surplus ...In the past two years Brazil had remitted 24 billion dlrs in debt servicing and received only two billion in fresh funds,\" he added.     Funaro said that during his recent trip to the U.S., Europe and Japan to explain Brazil\'s decision last month to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt, he stressed the country\'s commitment to growth.     \"We need to and will make the effort (to solve the debt problem) but we cannot make an effort that means we stop growing,\" he said, adding that political and not purely commercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis.     Brazil, whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largest in the developing world, has been under pressure from official and private creditors to work out an economic adjustment program with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreign payments problems.     President Jose Sarney\'s government has repeatedly refused to approach the Fund, arguing that an IMF programme would lead to recession. Funaro said that in his talks with creditors he had tried to restore credibility in the country in the hope of finding a lasting solution to the debt problem.     \"We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be one of continuous crisis.\"     To sustain internal growth Brazil would have to import more machinery and equipment this year and export fewer raw materials. The country was thus targetting a fall in this year\'s trade surplus to 8.0 billion dlrs from 1986\'s 9.5 billion.     Domestically, Funaro said economies had led to a reduction in the public sector deficit to 2.7 pct of gross domestic product in 1986, the lowest for many years and that this should fall to 1.5 pct this year.  \n',27
'The trade surplus doubled in february to 261 mln dlrs from January\'s 129 mln, but was  below the 628 mln of February 1986, official figures show.     The director of the Banco do Brasil\'s foreign trade department (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in February confirmed a rising trend in exports, which totalled 1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after excluding coffee and oil derivitives, was only slightly below the same month last year.     Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln in February 1986 because of lower prices, he added.     Fendt said that although the February results were lower than the average expected for the rest of the year, the government\'s target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9.5 billion dlrs.     Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled 22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.     Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with government plans to foster economic growth.     Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above the traditional average for Brazil.     In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oil and wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in the same 1986 period.     This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilian industry to equip to raise production and is perfectly compatible with the government\'s program for economic growth, Fendt added.  \n',27
'Brazil wants to increase its steel exports to the United States, now limited because of tough import restraints set in 1984 by the Reagan administration, a spokeswoman for the Brazilian Steel Institute (IBS) said.     Brazilian and U.S. Trade officials held the first of a three-day meeting today in Brasilia to discuss the issue.     In 1984, after three months of painstaking negotiations, the U.S. Government reached accords with seven steel-exporting nations - Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Spain, South Africa and South Korea - to reduce their shipments to the United States by about 30 pct in 1985.     The 1984 restraints established that for 1987 Brazil\'s steel exports to the U.S. Could not exceed 632,000 tonnes, increasing to 640,000 tonnes in 1988 and 670,000 tonnes in 1989, the last of the five-year deadline set by the agreements.     Brazilian officials are trying to increase Brazil\'s export share of non-flat products to the U.S. Market.

'Britain today called on Japan to increase foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism and the harm it would bring to it and other trading nations.     British Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon said Japan must heed a report issued by a Japanese government advisory body in December calling for faster domestic demand to help cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy.     \"I recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to Japan\'s domestic economy,\" he told a group of Japanese businessmen in London.     \"But these short term difficulties should not be allowed to deflect Japan from the fundamental reforms necessary,\" he said.     \"It is not just a domestic issue for Japan. If import propensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from protectionist lobbies, particularly in the U.S. With whom Japan has so massive a surplus,\" he said.     \"They may well succeed in securing action by governments which would be highly injurious to trading nations like Japan and the U.K.\"     Channon said there had been substantial growth in the volume of trade between Japan and Britain, amounting to 6.2 billion sterling (9.8 billion dlrs) last year.     But he added: \"Regrettably too much of it was in one direction, with the Japanese selling us 3.7 billion sterling (5.8 billion dlrs) more than we sold them.\"  \n',27
'British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard told Japan to resolve the row over the U.K. Firm Cable and Wireless Plc\'s CAWL.L shareholding in a new Japanese telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in trade relations.     In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade imbalance between the two countries.     \"I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister that I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world,\" Howard told reporters.     \"He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the message got home,\" he added.     British frustration over the lopsided trade balance - nearly six billion dlrs in Japan\'s favour last year - has reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howard said.     Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and Wireless from having a major role in the international telephone market in Japan.     \"I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading relations,\" Howard said. \"We simply aren\'t prepared to continue to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a long time.\"     Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable to comment on Howard\'s meeting with their minister.     But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are increasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade.     Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied.     Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the telecommunications issue.     \"There are measures which are under consideration if we continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,\" he added, but gave no details.     He said he had received a reassuring response from the Japanese he has spoken with.     \"But of course we\'ve had reassuring signs from the Japanese for quite some time,\" he added. \"What I\'ve made plain is we expect to see action.\"     Howard ruled out using powers in Britain\'s Financial Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices. Those powers, which allow London to ban foreign financial firms like banks from Britain, are designed to ensure U.K. Firms equal access to overseas financial markets.  \n',27
'A senior British official said that protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the global trading system.     Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers, \"the community would have to retaliate.\"     His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.     Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress.     De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.     Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.     Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.     Channon said Japan\'s trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.     \"The more united pressure there could be, the better,\" he said.     Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes.     He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.     \"But if both sides drew back from the brink that time,\" he said, \"\"it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion.\"     Channon added that \"There is increasing reesentment in Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines.\"     He said other potential conflicts are already in sight - alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils - and \"the commuity and the United States must therefore learn to manage their relations better.\"     He said another bill to let the United States retaliate against a nation if that nation\'s market was not open to U.S. goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.     He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not by the United States, adding \"if the (trade) law is to be interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is to happen to the rest of us?\"      \n',27
'Farm subsidies and protectionist moves threaten healthy trade on both sides of the Atlantic, Michael Jopling, British minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, warned.     \"It would not be sensible to provoke another dispute between Europe and the United States,\" Jopling said in remarks prepared for an evening speech.     \"But some things are clear and they apply on both sides of the Atlantic. We cannot continue to pile up stocks while world demand shrinks,\" he said.     \"Governments must not operate farm policies as if they were purely domestic affairs with no impact on others. They also have to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop a healthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionism and excessive subisdies.     \"And above all, Europe and the United States have too many common interests to make it worthwhile to engage in trade wars and competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting no one.\" He added, \"It is crucial that the United States and the European Community remain friends.\"     Jopling, who is a member of the EC agriculture committee, was in Indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with U.S. officials in Washington later this week.     Jopling also criticized a recent proposal still under consideration by the EC for a tax on vegetable and fish oils.     He said his government would oppose such a move because \"We do not think it is correct that a shortage of funds to support (EC) farmers should be alleviated by raising money at the consumer\'s expense.\"  \n',27

The Department of Trade and Industry said the government was drawing up contingency plans to force Japan into opening up its domestic markets but a spokesman said such moves were very much a last resort.

'Republican members of the House Agriculture Committee said they will propose amendments tomorrow to a pending trade bill increasing funding for the export enhancement program, EEP, and significantly expanding the scope of the program.     At a press conference, Republican lawmakers said they would propose expanding EEP to include all countries \"willing to purchase additional commodities at reasonable prices.\"     In addition, the Congressmen said they would propose extending the life of EEP to five years from the current three years and increasing the EEP funding ceiling to 2.5 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion at present.     The Agriculture committee tomorrow will begin drafting amendments to an omnibus trade bill now before the House.     Responding to the Republican plan, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said they favor a flexible, targeted use of EEP instead of an across-the-board program which they termed too costly.     The Republican Congressmen also said they will offer an amendment to the trade bill instructing the U.S. Agriculture Department to value the bonus commodities used for EEP at the market value, rather than the cost of acquisition.     But Lyng said USDA already plans to change to market value accounting rather than acquisition value, in order to avoid hitting a funding ceiling for eep of 1.5 billion dlrs.     Lyng said under market value accounting only about 700 mln dlrs of EEP commodities have been used to date. Using acquisition value, USDA officials said the value is higher.  \n',27

'Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said he held \"frank\" discussions with the Canadian province premiers on the pace of free trade talks with the United States, but the longstanding issue of provincial ratification remains to be settled.     Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings with the 10 premiers, Mulroney said further discussions would be held in June and September to discuss the role of the provinces in approving any new trade deal.     But he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping talks with the Unites States that got under nearly two years ago.     \"It appears reasonable progress is being made (in the talks),\" Mulroney said.     Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed, \"Things are running pretty quickly now.\"     The talks, launched by Mulroney\'s Progressive Conservative government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the U.S., are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the world\'s largest trading partnership.     But the provinces are expected to play a major role in any new trading arrangement, and some of the provincial leaders complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification formula.     \"It\'s my view that we should be thinking about these things right now, along with the questions of the substance of the agreement,\" commented Ontario Premier David Peterson, who has been highly critical of the talks in the past.     But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreement was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no need for a \"hard and fast formula.\"     Peckford said it appears Canada is prepared to make concessions to the United States on financial services in order to make inroads on other bargaining areas, such as agriculture.     Canadian published reports, quoting government sources, say the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border tariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.     A rough draft of the accord is expected to be presented to the premiers at the June meeting while the finished document is hoped to be presented to Congress in October.     \"It\'s a very tight time frame,\" Ontario\'s Peterson said last night. \"But at this moment it is tough to say what will transpire.\"  \n',27
'Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time.     She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices, Carney said.     Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively.     Carney later tolds the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.     European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the European Community, voiced reservations about some of the principles.     Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way.     \"The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion,\" she said.     However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are, Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade negotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by October, are progressing well.  \n',27
'External Affairs Minister Joe Clark today vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. action against Canadian potash exports, but also warned against raising the alarm too early in the dispute.     In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimously Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million U.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry.     \"We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that Canadian interests are well protected,\" Clark told the House of Commons in the daily question period.     But he said the opposition parties should be careful \"not to raise false alarms too early.\"     The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department\'s trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potash producers from New Mexico, claiming unfair government subsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada\'s shipments.     Canada, the world\'s largest potash producer, exported 9.8 mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a third going to the U.S.     Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer, comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan.     In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the ruling as just another \"trade harrassment\" from the U.S. and criticized Clark\'s assurances the country\'s interests would be protected.     \"We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,\" Axworthy said.     Canada\'s Progressive Conservative government agreed to impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with the U.S.     Axworthy urged the government to present Canada\'s case to world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade.     But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the U.S.     \"What we are seeking to do is put in place a better system,\" Clark said.     Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed confidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problem stems from low international commodity prices and not government subsidies.     \"The reality of the problem and the injury is caused worldwide,\" he said. \"It\'s caused by a downturn in the commodity price for fertilizer, whether it\'s potash fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer or whatever.\"  \n',27
'Trade is the most urgent problem facing U.S.-Canadian relations because of a pressing need to reach a new bilateral pact within the coming months, Joe Clark, Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, said.     Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting for more than a year in an effort to work out an agreement.     \"The most urgent problem now is the trade question because that has to be decided within the next 10 months,\" Clark told the Commonwealth Club of California. \"We have a fast track authority from your Congress for approval or rejection of whatever the negotiators achieve.\"     Clark said that, as a practical matter, an initial agreement must be reached by late September or early October.     He listed environmental questions, particularly acid rain, and defense as the second and third most important bilateral issues facing Ottawa and Washington.     On Wednesday, President Reagan announced that he will seek 2.5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rain problem. Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in advance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.     In a question-and-answer session with the public affairs group, Clark said that the two countries must find better mechanisms for resolving their trade disputes.     \"This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted on corn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were quasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in place now are not working adequately in either of our interests,\" he said.     Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington\'s rules on government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, he said.     \"There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order to secure substantial contracts in the United States, have had to move their head offices out of our country into your country because you have national procurement requirements,\" he said.     In turn, he added, the United States would like to change some of the procurement requirements that exist at the provincial government level in Canada.     Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions.     \"What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, in the first instance, to propose, and then governments and congresses will have judge,\" he said.     In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United States has tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports to its northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan. \"Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last year than you bought from Canada,\" he said.  \n',27
'Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said \"significant progress\" was being made in trade talks with the United States and a profile of a major deal was emerging.     Opening a debate on free trade in the House of Commons, Mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs in Canada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries.     Mulroney, who offered few new details of the talks, said that while the negotiations were risky and difficult, \"a profile of a major trade deal is now emerging.\"   In a 50-minute address, Mulroney made an often passionate defense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areas of the country a major economic boost.     \"Because of our trading patterns over a period of decades, we are in the process of building two Canadas -- one that is rich and promising, one that is under-developed and under-employed,\" said Mulroney.     \"What we want is to make sure Newfoundlanders and British Columbians and Albertans and others, that they get their chance. They must be given the opportunity to trade their way to prosperity.\"     Few detials have been released on the trade talks which were launched nearly two years ago between the two nations that are each others most important trading partners.     Recent published reports in Canada, quoting senior trade sources, said the countries were close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border trariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.     It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks is a Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes, something that would give Canada protection from Washington\'s tough trade remedy laws.     But Mulroney, sharply critical of protectionist sentiment in the U.S, said Canada was a \"fair trader\" and denied the government was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to the American market.     He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides.     \"We recognize a good deal must be a fair deal, one that is fair to both sides,\" Mulroney said.  \n',27
'A group of Canadian lawmakers from Ontario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major trade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress.     At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, an organization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of the Ontario Parliament\'s Select Committee on Economic Affairs, said the exemption would help trade relations.     The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would harm the U.S. economy.     Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any grounds.     Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S. congressmen, \"I can understand (the trade bill).

You do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely consider exempting our country from that bill,\" he added.     Canada is the United States\' largest trading partner, with two-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985, according to the coalition. But the U.S. ran up a 23 billion dlr deficit in manufactured goods that year compared to a 14 billion dlr surplus in services trade with its neighbour.  \n',27
'China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.     But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports.     The official International Business newspaper today published China\'s demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.     \"It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports,\" the editorial said.     \"The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).     \"Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries,\" it added.     The paper also printed an article by China\'s commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that \"all kinds of difficulties and restrictions\" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.     He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.  \n',27
'China\'s trade deficit totalled 700 mln dlrs in the first two months of this year, according to figures released by the State Statistics Bureau.     The New China News Agency quoted the Bureau as saying foreign trade totalled 9.3 billion dlrs in the period, of which exports were worth 4.3 billion dlrs.     The bureau said total trade volume was up 2.5 pct on the same 1986 period, with exports up 18.1 pct, but it gave no other comparative figures.     China\'s 1986 trade deficit totalled 12 billion dlrs, official figures show.  \n',27
'China should tighten imports of ordinary goods and restrict or even forbid import of goods which can be made domestically, Premier Zhao Ziyang said.     He told the National People\'s Congress, China\'s parliament, that the country\'s foreign exchange is limited and must be used where it is most needed.     \"We should expand production of import substitutes and increase their proportion,\" he said.     On exports, China should increase its proportion of manufactured goods, especially textiles, light industrial goods, electronics and machinery, he said.     Zhao said China should lower the cost of exports and control the export of goods that incur too much loss. In 1986 China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs, down from a record 14 billion in 1985.     Zhao said China should work to provide a more favourable investment environment for foreign businessmen. It should use foreign funds for production and construction, with stress on firms making goods for export or import substitutes.     China should also earn more foreign exchange from tourists and contracted labour abroad, he added.  \n',27
'China\'s trade deficit in January fell to 310 mln dlrs from 460 mln in January 1986, the China Daily Business Weekly said.     Quoting customs figures, the paper said exports fell to 1.75 billion dlrs from 1.84 billion and imports fell to 2.06 billion from 2.3 billion.  \n',27
'The value of trade between China and Taiwan via Hong Kong fell 13 pct to 7.45 billion H.K. Dlrs in 1986 from 8.59 billion dlrs in 1985, Hong Kong\'s Census and Statistics Department said.     Taiwan\'s exports to China through Hong Kong fell to 6.33 billion dlrs last year from 7.69 billion in 1985, while China\'s exports rose to 1.12 billion dlrs from 904 mln dlrs.     Economists in Hong Kong tolds that China\'s controls on scarce foreign currency hurt its imports of Taiwanese consumer goods, such as electric fans and television sets.     Herbal medicine and textiles were among China\'s chief exports to Taiwan.     Taiwan does not allow direct trade with China and indirect trade is routed mainly through Hong Kong.  \n',27
'French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on superpower arms control moves and trade issues.     French officials said a major aim of Chirac\'s visit was to present France\'s concern that the United States might ignore European security interests in any accord with Moscow on removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent.     But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats said.     France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets, conventional forces and chemical weapons.     Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position saying: \"Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.\"     Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a dispute between two leading research institutes over patent rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS.     In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).     \"This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,\" Reagan said at the signing ceremony.      He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80 per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation.     The foundation would also raise private funds and would donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less developed countries.      Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House East Room, with Reagan describing France as \"America\'s oldest ally in war and peace.\"      \"I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new diseases and drugs,\" Chirac replied.     But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on over the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise in protectionism in the U.S. Congress.      A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to sell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of lessening surplus stocks.     Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume, during his two-day visit to Washington.     The U.S. official described the idea as a \"grain producers\' OPEC\" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- and said it went against the Reagan administration\'s desire to lessen government intervention in trade.  \n',27
'World Bank President Barber Conable expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread throughout the industrial world.     But in an interview withs, Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war.     Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth.     \"We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn\'t close at the same time,\" he said.     He said the U.S. action against Japan was \"a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy.\"     The interview came just before next week\'s semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.     Referring to Brazil\'s recent interest payments moratorium, Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched.     He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform.     The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment and reducing government\'s role in the economy.     \"We\'re comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect, however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,\" Conable said.     He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time.     He noted, \"the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt.\"     Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October, 1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank.     Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank\'s organization to be completed in the next several weeks.     He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency.     the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency\'s 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities.     \"I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow,\" Conable said.     However, he said \"I don\'t believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I don\'t believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose.\"     He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis.     Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues.     On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that \"I don\'t have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development.\"     He added, \"so I don\'t feel a great calling to personalize the institution.\"     On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank\'s International Development Association was earmarked for Africa.     Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those in the Sub-Sahara, during next week\'s meetings.  \n',27
'Top U.S. and European farm trade and government representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance.     Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production.     \"It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful,\" U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Administrator William Bailey said.     Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment.     The need for urgent reforms is justified by the \"imbalance and tensions of the world economy,\" the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Jean-Claude Paye said.     And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he noted.     Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas.     Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of Cargill (USA), one of the world\'s largest cereal houses.     Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.     However, \"differentiated policy treatment is required\" to take account of large disparities in the situation around the EC, he said.     \"Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the Community,\" he said.  \n',27
'Denmark\'s balance of payments on current account was provisionally put at zero in February, against a 181 mln crown surplus in January and a 1.5 billion deficit in February 1986, the National Statistics Office said.     Exports rose to 13.94 billion crowns in February from 12.53 billion in January, against 14.16 billion in February last year. February imports rose to 13.94 billion from 12.35 billion in January, against 15.67 billion in February 1986.     The February figure provisionally gives a trade surplus for 1987 of 180 mln crowns, against a 3.04 billion deficit in the same 1986 period.  \n',27
'Already strained relations between the U.S. And the European Community (EC) are likely to get worse before they get better, director general of the Dutch Economics Ministry\'s foreign affairs division Frans Engering said.     Speaking at an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in The Hague, Engering noted the developing history of crises over steel, citrus and pasta, and warned of more to come.     \"I consider the strident tone of US declarations on Airbus ill-advised, and the EC fats and oils tax proposal a dangerous provocation,\" he said. \"I feel that we shall probably have to deal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future.\"     Not only is the US Congress clearly very determined to get the American balance of payments into better shape, but the risks of brinkmanship are all the greater because the EC has its own constraints in meeting outside pressure, Engering noted.     \"If we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable that we keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war, then I think the answer is probably yes,\" he said.     In order to reduce these tensions, decision-making in the EC must become less self-centred, and the US Administration will have to exercise the authority to convince Congress and pressure groups of the need for accommodation, he added.  \n',27
'The Netherlands recorded a flat trade balance in January, with both exports and imports totaling 14.2 billion guilders, a modestly lower compared with December but sharply down from January last year, an Economics Ministry spokesman said, quoting official statistics.

'The European Community (EC) and Soviet-led Comecon ended talks here, having made progress on setting up formal trade relations, but no breakthrough because of Comecon\'s refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of the EC, delegates said.     Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of a joint declaration setting up official relations after 30 years of mutual non-recognition. John Maslen, head of the EC delegation, tolds as he emerged from the final session: \"We made some progress, but we have called for another meeting.\"     Officials, who asked not to be named, said the Comecon team had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC.     Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An EC negotiator taking part in the three-day talks said: \"We wanted the territorial clause in, but Comecon said no.\"     A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was made towards clarifying positions, but another meeting would be necessary to complete the work.     Any decision in principle to set up relations would require approval by the Community\'s Council of Ministers and by the executive committee of Comecon.     Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads the East bloc delegation, tolds ahead of today\'s session: \"We have narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but not on all questions.\"     Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the Community, he replied: \"This question is not contained in the draft which our side presented.\"     West German diplomats said they would insist on including the clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement.     The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading blocs here last September and the first-ever direct talks between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic relations in January.     The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite non-recognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a five billion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about half the deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price of Soviet oil imported by the EC.  \n',27

'The European Community (EC) expressed disquiet over protectionist moves in the United States to limit imports of textiles and said it would retaliate immediately if EC exports were hit.     A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq had written to his U.S. Counterpart, special U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, outlining the concerns of the 12-nation Community.     The draft legislation under consideration by Congress would impose permanent quotas on products entering the U.S. and seek to limit any increase to a growth in the overall trade.  \n',27
'The European Community (EC) considers talks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks on other trade reform in the present GATT round, Willy de Clercq, external relations commissioner of the EC, said.     He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to reach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade.     He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That included agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT.     Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT round include reform of trade in merchandise and services.     De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand.     Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter, also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade reform was reached as early as possible.     But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after long and hard negotiations, and the EC did not want changes.     \"We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached, and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one undertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks, no fast track, no slow track. It has just one track, the track - and that\'s all,\" de Clercq said.     \"If you start selecting priorities, your priority is not my priority. We say that agriculture is urgent, but it\'s not the only urgent thing,\" he said.     He said the Punte del Este agreement had taken eight months to prepare and eight days of negotiations.  \n',27
'The U.S. and the European Community could enter into a new trade dispute unless urgent action is taken to explain EC farm policy to the U.S. Congress, French official sources said.     They said Prime Minister Jacques Chirac planned to urge EC Commission president Jacques Delors to send a team of experts to Washington as soon as possible.     Chirac returned to Paris this morning after three days of talks in New York and Washington in which trade and protectionism featured prominently.     At the centre of the new trade tension is an EC Commission proposal to tax vegetable oils, the sources said.  \n',27
'Sir Roy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, said pending U.S. trade legislation is a misguided attempt to deal with the nation\'s trade deficit and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form.     \"To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by legislation is a mistake,\" he told the Foreign Trade Association here.     Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which he warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on a product-for-product basis.     \"Retaliation does not have to be matched product to product,\" Denman said.     He said in the case of textiles import restrictions, however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports.     \"Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on European exports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likely to retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports to Europe,\" Denman said.     He also took exception to U.S. proposals to require countries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. to cut those surpluses or face special tariffs.     \"This would conflict with international obligations, throw a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and could easily boomerang,\" he warned of the tariff proposals.     Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seek reciprocity in specific trade sectors.     \"Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers would simply lead to retaliation from the other party,\" he said, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in another.  \n',27
'The European Community Commission has charged the United States with breaking international trade rules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market and said it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT.     In the latest of a series of trade disputes with Washington, the executive authority alleged that a section of the U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminated against imported products in favour of domestically-produced goods.     The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to rule on whether the section in question, which officials said had proved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules.     Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures if, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed to bring the disputed section into line with international rules.     The executive\'s decision to go to GATT follows a complaint to it by the Dutch company Akzo AKZO.AS, whose \"aramid\" synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market because of charges by the U.S. Firm Dupont that the fibres violate the American company\'s patents.     Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), was discriminatory and incompatible with GATT provisions.     The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the U.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over imported products. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the ITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court.     \"Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourable than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods produced in the United States,\" it said in a statement.  \n',27
'The European Community (EC) has warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S. trading partners.     The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.     A copy of the letter was made available tos.     Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry.     But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices.     Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved.     He said \"If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory, then the United States would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners.\"     Denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws, saying \"in the last resort, any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest.\"     Otherwise, he said, \"the risk would be counter-reaction by trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the United States.\"     Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims.     Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.     \"Changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States alone on the world trading system,\" he said.     House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by President Reagan.     There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the entire trade bill because of the textile amendment.      \n',27
'The European Community (EC) yesterday warned Japan and the United States, its main trading partners, that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC\'s relations with both countries.     EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan\'s continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make a greater effort to open up its markets. They also said they were disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress that would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were prepared to react. The U.S. Administration has already distanced itself from the bill.     EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written to his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, outlining the EC\'s concerns.     The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S. Moves towards protectionism. \"The adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateral relations,\" it said.     Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it said.     In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said they \"deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more.\"     The statement said the EC would continue to insist that Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand.     Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take appropriate action where necessary.     One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. \"It will be back on the table again and again,\" the diplomat said.     De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said, \"There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the Community concerning trade relations with Japan.\"     But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war, and the ministers called for more cooperation with Japan in industry and research.  \n',27
'Japanese microchip makers are being strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan\'s market to foreign chips, industry analysts said.     But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space, they said.     U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.     \"MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) associate vice president Peter Wolffe.     Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject to the pact\'s price controls.     The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.     U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.     But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp said it would cut production in line with MITI\'s request.     \"NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI\'s demands,\" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. \"Once NEC cuts production, it means they all have.\"     Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.     \"The best way to lower cost is to produce more,\" said Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.     Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt Aizawa said.     Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new restrictions, some industry officials said.     \"It\'s like tax avoidance schemes,\" said Steve Donovan, head of MMI Japan K.K. \"As soon as you close one route, another opens.\"     MITI\'s pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier shrugged off MITI guidance.     \"It\'s getting to be like communism,\" said one.     But analysts said output cuts could help by making it easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.     \"They\'re going to have to start running their businesses like businesses,\" Bache\'s Wolffe said.     MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry officials said response has been mixed at best.     \"There has been some change, but it\'s not across the board,\" said one U.S. Spokesman. \"The companies have a varying degree of urgency.\"     The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.     Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.     Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they said.     Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S. Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.     Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S. Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.     \"The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn\'t even have an office here,\" a source close to the industry said. \"You could question just how committed they are.\"     In addition, some industry analysts question the effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third country chipmakers such as those in South Korea.     \"(South) Korea\'s gaining market share,\" said one analyst. \"They\'re the real winners from the agreement.\"  \n',27
'Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago.     Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. Some of them are \"too sophisticated to convert into financial terms,\" one banking source said.     But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate.     They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland\'s economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.     \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said.     The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission.     According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders.     But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation.\"     A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed.     Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.     Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons.  \"Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons,\" said one expert. \"It\'s an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy.\"     \"There\'s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today\'s reality.     Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry.     \"MFN doesn\'t really mean anything, only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now,\" said one Western envoy.     He said Polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland\'s efforts to regain entry.     Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently.     Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\"     While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said \"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won\'t cut any ice. The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity.\"     Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States.     He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States, \"but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners.\"     He stressed that the U.S. \"had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland\'s partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt.\"     Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role.     \"As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations,\" he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.  \n',27
'The U.S. Congress is making Japan, with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around America\'s record trade deficit.     \"Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers to our exports,\" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said.     \"If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,\" the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the trade bill.     Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging bill is being readied for probable House approval next month.     Japan\'s bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.     Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to the dollar\'s decline in world currency markets as a reason to press Japan to buy more U.S. goods.     They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.     In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S. semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for Japan\'s failure to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.     Congress also has been been angered by the administration\'s lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications goods, and financial services.     The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and measures to force the administration take tough action against foreign trade barriers and unfair competition.     Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese products or make them more expensive with higher duties.     The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win temporary relief from surges in imports.     The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.     Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key Democrats to press for passage of the amendment.     The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per cent a year for three years.     \"I\'m tired of going into companies and having managers say to me, \'We\'re not over competing in Japan because we can\'t compete in the marketplace.\' That argument needs to be taken away from American business,\" Gephardt said.     The administration has said it could not support a trade bill containing such a provision.      \n',27
'The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, economists said.     \"The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in 1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be screaming at those countries about their exports,\" said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.     Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S. after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.     Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress, the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.     The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar\'s steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods.     U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan\'s trade surplus this year.     But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.     \"In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing. Now it\'s NIC-bashing,\" said Robert Chandross, of Lloyds Bank PLC.     Asia\'s four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.     The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.     And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6 billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.     Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.     Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.     For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan\'s trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.     The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the area of \"big-ticket\" manufactured goods, notably cars.     Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.     \"The NICs\' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,\" said Bob Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.     The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea\'s computer products exports, 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment.     A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.     While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.     But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.     Morgan expects Taiwan\'s overall trade surplus to grow to 18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and Korea\'s to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.     Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.     \"A lot of Korea and Taiwan\'s exports to the U.S. have been at Japan\'s expense,\" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.     February\'s Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.     But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work with a sizeable lag, economists say.     The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan\'s and Korea\'s currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.     But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.     \"We\'ve not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes,\" said Bethlehem Steel\'s Wendt.     And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.     Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will get given the administration\'s free-trade stance. \"It\'s hard to see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then the question is, will it have teeth?\" one economist said.      \n',27
'Egypt and the Soviet Union are expected to sign an agreement in Moscow next week settling Cairo\'s three billion dlr military debt, Egyptian officials said.     One official, who asked to remain anonymous, tolds a draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future interest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 year repayment term.     Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday.     Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow on Tuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue.     One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate for trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on a rate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar which Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar.     The officials said part of the debt would be paid in exports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture.     Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the door for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built steel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year development plan ending June 30 1992.     Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprint and glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military hardware, the officials said.     An estimated 65 pct of Egypt\'s arsenal is still made up of Soviet-supplied equipment, one official said.     Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977 when then-president Anwar Sadat broke with its long-standing ally and turned to the U.S..  \n',27
'The Japanese ambassador to the U.S. Suggested that Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone make efforts to present \"advanced\' proposals on trade issues when he visits Washington next month.     Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga made the recommendation at a meeting with Nakasone, Kyodo News Service said.     Matsunaga also advised that the prime minister should be prepared to discuss U.S.-Japan economic issues.     Matsunaga cited issues such as a U.S.-Japan micro chip trade pact, foreign access to the Kansai international airport project, and a new international telecommunications firm.     Matsunaga returned on Sunday to report to Japanese leaders on recent U.S. Developments over trade, in preparation for Nakasone\'s visit to Washington, April 29 to May 5.     Kyodo quoted Nakasone as telling reporters after meeting the envoy, \"I entirely accept what ambassador Matsunaga recommended.\" Nakasone did not elaborate.     The U.S.-Japan trade dispute intensified last week when President Ronald Reagan said the U.S. Would impose heavy tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation against alleged Japanese breach of the computer chip trade pact.     Meanwhile, Nakasone\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is to consider measures to boost imports and open up the Japanese market, such as government purchase of supercomputers and expanding foreign access to the Kansai airport project, party sources said.     The LDP international economic affairs council was responding to Nakasone\'s request for measures to reduce Japan\'s increasing trade surpluses with the U.S. And Europe, they said.  \n',27
'Africa may have to follow Brazil in halting foreign debt payments unless industrialised nations are prepared to be more flexible in trade and economic policy, Ethiopian trade minister Tesfay Dinka said.     Growing protectionism and declining commodity prices had caused a major deterioration in the export earnings of all developing countries, he said in an opening speech to a meeting of African trade ministers in Addis Ababa.     Unless there was an early improvement in developing countries\' terms of trade \"the only choice is to follow the route that Brazil appears to have taken,\" Tesfay said.    The two-day meeting of delegates from 50 African states was called to work out a consensus ahead of the Group of 77 ministerial meeting in Havana next month, when the developing countries will debate their strategy in economic negotiations with the West.     Tesfay accused the West of intransigence in the negotiation of recent commodity agreements.     The failure of the International Coffee Organisation to agree on the reintroduction of export quotas would mean \"several African countries will not have the foreign exchange to import essential items,\" he said.     Coffee accounts for 60 pct of Ethiopian exports and the recent fall in world coffee prices has sharply reduced the country\'s foreign exchange earnings.     Adebayo Adedeji, the executive secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, told the meeting that there was an increasing net outflow of resources from Africa.     He blamed this on high interest rates, debt servicing and the repatriation of profits by foreign investors.     Africa paid 13 billion dlrs to service its total foreign debt last year and by 1990 annual service payments are expected to rise to between 16 and 24 billion, Adedeji said.     He accused industrialised countries of failing to provide more resources to implement the U.N. Program for Africa\'s economic recovery and development, despite Africa\'s willingness to raise two thirds of the capital from domestic sources.     The U.N. Program, approved last year, calls for 128 billion dlrs of economic investment in Africa over five years.     Western donors were asked to contribute 46 billion dlrs, with the rest being raised from local resources, but Adedeji said the donors had not responded as hoped.    In view of this poor response, he said \"it is possible that by the year 2,000 nearly all African countries, except a few, will be categorised as least developed countries.\"     At present, 27 of Africa\'s 50-odd states are officially listed in this category.  \n',27
'Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest trade row between the United States and Japan.     Japan\'s huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe, as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold.     The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said.     But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting with the U.S. To do something about Japan\'s huge trade surplus.     \"The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the U.S.,\" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy Research Centre in London. \"Basically, their policies are pretty much the same.\"     But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically, Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said.     \"In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,\" he added. \"In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich.\"     Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington\'s tendency to impose so-called \"countervailing duties\" - an import tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair.     In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said.     In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade.     But the European Community has challenged the agreement as a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) practices that discriminates against its microchip producers.     \"It follows that they\'re not likely to rally to the side of the United States in defence of the agreement,\" said Wolf.     Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest of Europe told correspondents they would let the EC take the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row.     A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels tolds there has been no change in the Community\'s position since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances.     In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign ministers deplored Japan\'s continued trade imbalance and appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets.     EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC.     Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a trade war, they said.     Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits, cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to try to improve the situation, the diplomats said.     In Britain, where the government is angered over the difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said last week that retaliatory action is being considered.     But government officials said last night, \"We are not talking about days or weeks. This is going to take time.\"     They said the government would consider its options at a cabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions were expected. The main thing the British would threaten the Japan with is denial of access to London\'s booming financial markets, government officials said.  \n',27
'China and the European Community (EC) signed an agreement on the establishment of an EC office here.     Chinese vice-foreign minister Zhou Nan and the EC\'s external relations commissioner, Willy De Clercq, signed the accord. EC sources said the office was likely to open in the second half of this year.     In 1986 the EC was China\'s third largest trading partner, with Chinese imports from the EC worth 5.7 billion dlrs and exports worth 2.6 billion dlrs.     De Clercq told the official China Daily that more joint ventures should be set up in China as a way of reducing China\'s trade deficit with the EC.     The EC\'s affairs in China are currently looked after by whichever country holds the group\'s six-monthly rotating presidency, now held by the Belgians until the Danes take over in July.  \n',27
'The Reagan administration wants to encourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not believe Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said.     \"It seems to me that more trade between us is better than less trade,\" he told a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations.     To that end, the administration in January allowed foreign policy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the Soviet Union to lapse, he said.     Also, Washington and its allies are reviewing remaining export controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibited items and speeding up the licensing process, he said.     Whitehead said, however, the prefential treatment that comes with most-favored-nation status is out for the moment.     U.S. law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countries that restrict emigration and other rights.     \"What we have seen so far (in improved rights under Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev) are promising trends,\" he said.     But, he added: \"We don\'t know if they will continue, we don\'t know how significant they will be.\"  \n',27
'A member of the Federal Reserve Board, Robert Heller, said he wanted to see stronger Japanese demand for American goods.     \"What I was advocating here was more Japanese purchases of American goods,\" Heller said in response to a question about the dollar\'s weakness in currency markets.     He told a Heritage Foundation forum, \"I\'d be very happy to see that.\"     In his formal remarks, Heller said he supported the idea of using commodity prices as an indicator for monetary policy.

Unadjusted, the February deficit was 2.4 billion francs and the two-month cumulative deficit 8.1 billion, the ministry said in a statement.     The Ministry said February exports totalled 73.8 billion francs, an 8.9 pct increase on January, while imports totalled 74.3 billion francs, an increase of 5.8 pct.     Farm and food trade showed a two billion franc surplus after a surplus of 2.4 billion in January.

'The ruling GATT Council deferred a decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.     David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.     The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips, officially known as semiconductors.     The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.     The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.     Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland, Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC complaint during the heated Council debate.     Japan\'s delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were unfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks.  \n',27

He told an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade the widening gap between industrialized and developing countries and an unfair international economic system were major obstacles to growth in developing countries.     \"I wish to emphasize that the growth in the volume of the external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the developed market economy countries,\" Mamman said.

'A successful new GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.     Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, tolds bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.     \"That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round,\" he said. \"The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.\"     The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time.     The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said.     \"Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that\'s the basic objective of the new GATT round,\" he said.     But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.     \"It\'s a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,\" he said.     \"They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future,\" he said.  \n',27
'The ruling GATT Council set up a formal dispute panel to examine a U.S. Complaint that a Canadian law prohibiting export of unprocessed herring and salmon was discriminatory.     David Wood, official spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing the decision was taken after bilateral consultations failed to resolve the row.     U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels charged during the Council debate that Canada was trying to preserve domestic jobs by insisting that herring and salmon be processed at home.     Robert White, Canada\'s deputy chief of delegation, replied the law was in line with GATT rules, and was for conservations reasons. But he agreed to setting up the dispute panel.  \n',27
'Long term pressure by trade ministers is necessary if the current Uruguay round of talks on the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) is to succeed, New Zealand\'s Overseas Trade minister Mike Moore said.     Moore told the opening meeting of trade ministers from 22 nations gathered for informal talks on the GATT that ministers \"need opportunities to keep in touch and to consider how the political problems inherent in an exercise like this one can be faced and resolved.\"     Moore said the Taupo meeting is one of a series of such international gatherings, which includes the OECD ministerial meeting in May and the G-7 meeting in Venice in June, enabling ministers to maintain contact.     World trade conditions are getting better not worse, he said.     He said New Zealand is \"moving rapidly and of our own initiative in the direction of liberalisation, and I warn you we shall be looking for partners.\"  \n',27
'The U.S. Will pursue its complaint that European governments unfairly subsidise the Airbus Industrie aircraft consortium in proceedings at the GATT civil aircraft committee, a GATT spokesman said today.     The U.S. Presented its case for the first time to the aircraft committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) during a special two-day session ending today. GATT rules cover some 80 pct of world commerce.     The 20-member committee agreed to open debate on the U.S. Complaint, starting with informal consultations and then holding a special session in July, trade officials said.     \"The tension has eased,\" the permanent trade ambassador of the 12-member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters. \"The U.S. Has decided to go through proper channels.\"     U.S. Trade officials again made clear their anger over what they call unfair government support for Airbus, voiced during a visit to European capitals in February.     In a letter calling for the special committee meeting, Washington charged France, West Germany, the U.K., Spain and the EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus.     The U.S. Charges that the Europeans are violating rules laid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.     Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines during the special session and asked the committee to confirm its view.     Official sources in the delegations said the U.S. Views would be considered during the informal consultations but the Europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against American civil aircraft practices.     Some delegates said the U.S. Position appeared to give such broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil aircraft accord needed re-negotiating. All these matters would be considered during the informal meetings.  \n',27
'The United States\' emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country\'s real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.      By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual report.     The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt, it said.     GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years.     GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit.     Raising U.S. Trade barriers \"would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however, increase inflation and reduce world trade,\" it said.     \"The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain,\" the report said.     GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism.     The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.     The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.     \"Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year,\" the report said.     GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar.     \"Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in turn, would adversely affect world trade.\"     But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States, despite the dollar\'s depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive.     It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad.     World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986, about half of the rate of the previous year.     Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct, continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT said.     Developing countries\' exports declined significantly, while their imports increased moderately, although full statistics are not available yet, GATT said.     The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia, Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports.  \n',27
'Soviet-West German trade is expected to develop favourably due to Moscow\'s increasing openness to East-West economic relations, Dresdner Bank AG\'s Moscow representative Michael Stein said.     He told a bank presentation the Soviet Union was last year hit by the fall in world oil prices, which cut export revenue from oil-related products and natural gas, and its overseas buying power was also adversely affected by the lower dollar.    Dresdner Bank economist Alfred Apholte said the Soviet Union\'s large currency and gold reserves had softened the impact of the dollar weakening and oil price drop.  \n',27

'Hong Kong recorded a 3.51 billion H.K. Dlr deficit in February after a 2.54 billion dlr surplus in January as imports climbed and exports slid, the Census and Statistics Department said.

Imports rose to 24.12 billion dlrs, up 2.6 pct from January\'s 23.52 billion dlrs and 42 pct above the 16.98 billion dlrs recorded in February 1986.     Total exports for the month fell 20.9 pct to 20.61 billion dlrs from 26.06 billion in January.

'National Bank of Hungary first vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year\'s severe trade deficit with the West.     Fekete tolds in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade.     \"It is useful to have a devaluation,\" he said. \"There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports.\"     The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today. Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow.     He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5.5 pct in 1986).     This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s, he added.     Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year.     But the country\'s hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3 mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.     Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.     One Western commercial attache here said: \"Devaluation of itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods.\"     Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry.     It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market.     Hungary\'s net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen.     He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation.     \"I am for credits to invest for that purpose,\" he said. \"I am against credits for consumption.\" He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.    Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he considered rates to be low.     Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints.  \n',27
'Amid new concerns about inflation, interest rate increases and trade confrontations, finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss a deteriorating global debt and economic situation.     The meetings, under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further, upsetting bond and stock markets.     Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new assistance.     Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works.     The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil, which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans.     Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to the very poorest states.     The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers in detail during next week\'s meetings and will undoubtedly be embraced by the developing countries.     \"There\'s interest on the part of some countries for looking at the support of the special problems of the very poorest countries, because their position is so extreme,\" a Reagan administration official said.     He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue.     The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor countries grow out of their problems.     The largest industrial countries have been attempting to coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other problems.     At the same time, the industrial countries see little evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct.     The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself,  continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other industrial countries to stimulate their economies.     These issues directly affect the debt problem and the ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their difficulties.     In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit, running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others to import more from developing countries.     The discussions, from April six to 10, will be wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the impact of development loans on the environment, according to monetary sources.     The talks will include an examination of trade protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on microchip products from Japan, the sources said.     The move accelerated the dollar\'s decline as financial markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing.     There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair market value and has kept its own market closed to imports, further undermining the international trading system.     At the same time, the ministers will discuss the fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export mainstay of many developing countries.     The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris, where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further.     The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for further debate on economic policy coordination.     As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America said it would reduce its federal budget deficit.     Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and economic policy changes in debtor nations.     Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more account of the environment when making loan for dams and other projects.     The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization plan for the Bank, now being prepared.  \n',27
'India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange.     Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources tolds.     Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).     \"The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading.     One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. But countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India\'s total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said.

Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86.     Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country\'s large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.     The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year.     But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.     One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering.     The MMTC\'s recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.     \"MMTC\'s recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India,\" a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible.     \"We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India,\" the trade official said.     Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said.     Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.  \n',27

'Indonesia cannot spend its way out of recession and has very limited economic options due to lower world oil prices, Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar was quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency.     \"If Indonesia spurs its economic growth too much, such as through expansionary monetary and budgetary policies, it might create negative effects not only on price increases, but also on the balance of payments,\" he told bankers and businessmen in the North Sumatran city of Medan.     Antara quoted him as saying Indonesia is relying on its export drive to help narrow its trade deficit.     Antara reported that Siregar said the government wanted to help boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries, which are centered in Sumatra.     \"I see Sumatra has great potential, as in the plantation sector in which family units are employed in great number,\" he said, according to the agency.     Indonesia relied on oil and gas exports for 70 pct of its export revenue until last year\'s fall in crude prices.

'World Bank President Barber Conable linked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World\'s sixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade and dismantle protectionist barriers.     \"We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the adjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulation of the economy,\" Conable told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Jakarta.     Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia\'s hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency.     The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted.     But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes.     \"The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government. We are not here to dictate to them,\" he stated.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly hit by last year\'s slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half.     Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto.     He voiced support for measures already taken, including September\'s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports.     \"The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today\'s world,\" he said.     The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year.     The World Bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce Indonesia\'s protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics and cement, western bankers and diplomats said.     The government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also considering selling off loss-making state companies.     Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find funds to cover its share of development projects, which otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed.

'Japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17, industry analysts said.     The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks, the analysts said.     \"Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of the Japanese semiconductor industry,\" analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said.     But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far, and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run.     Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs.     \"We\'ve seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, and it has virtually dried up for EPROMS,\" said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers.     \"Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching,\" Kurlack added.     Industry analysts said Japan\'s Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year\'s semiconductor accord with the U.S.     The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the U.S. market.     But some analysts said Japan\'s attempt to mollify the U.S. was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S.     As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.     \"The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from Washington, but at the same time they\'re demonstating their muscle,\" analyst Peck said.     The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to benefit U.S. chip makers.     \"I think this could be a very important factor for U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,\" industry analyst Elliot Levine of Ladenburg Thalmann Co said.     But analyst Peck said, \"it will take a few weeks to see whether Japan has genuinely cut production.\"     He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI\'s request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in plant and equipment.   \n',27
'Japan denied breaking a pact with the U.S. On semiconductor trade but said prices set out in the pact were too high and acknowledged difficulties in implementing the accord.     \"We are faithfully abiding by the ... Agreement but of course there are some problems,\" a spokesman for the International Trade and Industry Ministry tolds.     He said the high semiconductor prices recommended by the agreement were leaving Japanese manufacturers piling up stocks of unsellable products. \"We are aiming to reduce production in Japan but of course this takes time,\" he said.     The spokesman said some Japanese companies were selling chips in Europe and Asia below stipulated prices, but added: \"It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem.\"     The eight month old pact aims to stop Japan selling large quantities of chips at knock-down prices to the United States and other countries and to increase U.S. Semiconductor sales in Japan.     The U.S. Senate Finance Committee this week called on President Reagan in a non-binding resolution to retaliate against Japan for violating the agreement.  \n',27
'Agriculture Ministry officials said they are not considering cuts in import duties on chocolate to help ease friction with the United States over agricultural trade.     Japan has already lowered the duties sharply and we must consider domestic market conditions, an official said.     Duties on chocolate were cut to 20 pct from 31.9 pct in April 1983.     Washington has been demanding a cut to seven pct, equivalent to its own duties, ministry sources said.     Japanese chocolate imports rose to 8,285 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 5,908 in 1985, official statistics show.     However, the ministry sources added it is possible the government may make further cuts in response to strong U.S. And European demand.     \"Due to concern about the farm trade row with the U.S., Top-level government officials may press the ministry to cut the duties,\" one said.     But he said it would be difficult for Japan to resolve its overall trade row with Washington and reduce its trade surplus, which reached 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986.     Agricultural trade issues between Japan and the U.S. Include Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products.  \n',27
'Japan\'s current account surplus rose to 7.38 billion dlrs in February from 3.89 billion a year ago and from 4.95 billion in January, the Finance Ministry said.     The trade surplus rose to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 4.77 billion a year earlier and 5.70 billion in January.     The long-term capital account deficit widened to 11.40 billion dlrs from 8.06 billion a year ago, but it narrowed from 12.32 billion in January, the Ministry said.     Japan\'s February exports rose to 16.74 billion dlrs from 14.89 billion in February 1986 and from 14.65 billion in January, the Ministry said. Imports fell to 8.61 billion from 10.12 billion a year earlier and 8.94 billion in January.     The invisible trade deficit fell to 617 mln dlrs in February from 693 mln a year earlier, but was up from a 527 mln deficit in January.     Figures do not tally exactly because of rounding.     Transfer payments narrowed to a 140 mln dlr deficit last month from a 185 mln deficit a year earlier and a 225 mln deficit in January.     The basic balance of payments deficit in February fell to 4.02 billion dlrs from 4.17 billion in February 1986 and 7.37 billion in January. Short-term capital account payments swung to a 1.28 billion dlr deficit in February from a 1.60 billion surplus a year earlier and a 1.44 billion dlr surplus in January.     Errors and omissions were 2.65 billion dlrs in surplus, compared with a 1.27 billion surplus a year earlier and a 1.10 billion deficit in January. The overall balance of payments deficit rose to 2.65 billion dlrs from 1.30 billion a year earlier but was down from 7.04 billion in January.  \n',27
'Japan\'s customs-cleared trade surplus in the first 20 days of February jumped to 3.58 billion dlrs from 1.94 billion a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said.     The February interim surplus was sharply up from a 965.04 mln dlr surplus in the same January period.     FOB exports rose 14.6 pct from a year earlier in the first 20 days of February to 10.91 billion, while CIF imports fell 3.2 pct to 7.33 billion.     The average dollar/yen rates were 152.32 for exports and 152.31 for imports against 196.61 for exports and 196.27 for imports a year earlier.  \n',27
'The Japanese government appears to have little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.     The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In retaliation for Japan\'s alleged failure to keep a pact on the microchip trade signed last September.     A Foreign Ministry official tolds \"Japan has done what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait for those steps to take effect.\"     The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S. Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.      Analysts noted Japan\'s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in third countries at non-regulated prices.     \"I\'m not sure MITI can do much more than it has,\" said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.     A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.     Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in imports was not likely.     Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be levied on consumer electronics products rather than on microchips themselves.     \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time, there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,\" said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.     \"The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be delayed for another year,\" he said.     Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.     \"The American approach is full of contradictions,\" Jardine Fleming\'s Edwards said.     \"If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that hurts the final market,\" Edwards said.     But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S. Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also frustration with Japan\'s vast trade surplus. Some analysts argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.     Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd, said \"The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic economy and move away from an export-dependent economy.\"  \n',27
'Japan has launched a last-ditch effort to salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States - sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further.     \"We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,\" Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters.     \"If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will create very serious problems.\"     The Reagan Administration\'s Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors.     Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory action.     In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.     Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year.     He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so-called grey market.     \"We have almost no grey market,\" he said. \"Supply is diminishing.\"     To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI called in the president of Japan\'s largest semiconductor maker, NEC Corp NIPN.T last week, he said. It is also issuing specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary of Texas Instruments Inc.     Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for U.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers.     The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are expected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker Micron Technology Inc DRAM.O of cut-price Japanese sales in Hong Kong.     Yamamoto admitted that Oki Electric Industry Co\'s Hong Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices.     \"If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We will present our rebuttal,\" he said.     The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI\'s advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said.     He also called the case \"strange,\" but he stopped short of endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been trapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micron publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.  \n',27
'Japan is becoming dangerously isolated again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth, officials and businessmen from around the world said.     As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen, making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.     The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.     The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation\'s lifestyle. There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation.\"     Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.     The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact.     British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture.     On Friday, European currency dealers said European central banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.     Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community. \"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report,\" he said.     \"We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demand...Would take time,\" Saito said.     Saito\'s words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I only know that your government, under the leadership of Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\"     And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And we hope to see changes occur in the near future,\" visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.     Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa\'s report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.     Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem.     \"We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,\" said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.     \"The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour,\" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers.     Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.     Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue.     He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and steel industries.     A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy. Europeans are confused about this, underlined by von Moltke\'s reference to the \"leadership\" of the Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last September\'s government programme of new economic measures. \"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report,\" the ambassador said.  \n',27
'Japan\'s customs-cleared trade surplus fell to 1.89 billion dlrs in the first 10 days of March from a 1.91 billion surplus a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said.      The March interim surplus compared with a 1.70 billion dlr surplus in the same February period.      FOB exports in the first 10 days of March rose 5.8 pct from a year earlier to 5.50 billion dlrs and CIF imports rose 9.7 pct to 3.61 billion.      The average yen/dollar rate used for the statistics was 153.67 yen against 181.23 a year earlier.  \n',27
'The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness.     A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters.     Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate, but those without it will not automatically be denied licences, he said.     But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak.     U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement.     Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement.     The MITI spokesman said, \"If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure.\"     MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.     But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. \"As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money,\" a Hitachi Ltd HIT.T spokesman said.  \n',27
'Japan has agreed to drop barriers to American-caught herring and pollock, opening the way for shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced.     Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo.     He said the Commerce Department estimated U.S. shipments of processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later years.     There was no immediate assessment of the value of current U.S. shipments, but officials said the pact would lift quotas to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms.     At the same time, Yeutter said Washington was temporarily suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the two fish.     He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year after an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement.  \n',27
'Japan has assured a meeting of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic demand and restructure its economy.     Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that, in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September, a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the 1987/88 budget is approved.     Hata, speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting, said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy, but did not elaborate.     Hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever, reflecting financial deficits, payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries.  \n',27
'Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, is still under way and will be completed sometime next month.     The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far, and they said Japan would comment on the final results.     A report from Washington yesterday said the study has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies. The study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries.     Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said. OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid-May.     One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy, and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said.     \"The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country, such as geography,\" the source said.     He said it is highly likely that the final study will show Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world.     \"This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan\'s farm market further, but this would have little impact on Japan\'s agriculture policy,\" he said, without giving further details.     A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations like the United States and the European Community, but Japan is a major importer, he said.  \n',27
'Japanese officials sought to convince the U.S. That a U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead of an April 1 deadline set by the U.S. For them to prove their case.     \"We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact,\" Osamu Watanabe, Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry\'s (MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division, told foreign reporters.     \"The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place,\" he said.     U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States.     The agreement, signed last September, aimed at halting predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S. Semiconductor firms\' access to the Japanese market.     The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said.     Yukio Honda, director of MITI\'s Industrial Electronics Division, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries.     MITI\'s call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non-regulated grey market, Honda said.     \"The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, but in contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices,\" Honda said.     MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor exports to the United States, he added.     The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said.     Despite businessmen\'s ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls, regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results, Watanabe said. \"I am optimistic,\" he added.  \n',27
'The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its semiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said.     The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price Japanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to take retaliatory action after April 1.     The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus.     MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has been pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export.     Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to reduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request, they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks of the first quarter.     If that reduced production level were maintained through to the end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct below that of the first three months of the year.     MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second quarter cutback.     One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there are picking up.     MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attempts to ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact.  \n',27
'Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips from next month in line with government attempts to ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.     The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the sanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the plans, analysts said.     The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of products and are in retaliation for Japan\'s alleged failure to honour a semiconductor trade pact.     In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory pricing and open Japan\'s market to foreign products.     But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop the tariffs if Japan shows a \"clear indication\" that it will open its markets to U.S. Goods.     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the second quarter, following a call to reduce production by more than 20 pct the previous quarter.     MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports.     Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to cancel the tariffs ahead of next month\'s meeting between Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan.     \"The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword and shown that it can and will do business,\" said analyst Nick Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo.     But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can cut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal of the sanctions -- is more difficult.     \"The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC\'s (integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumer products. They\'re well supplied here,\" said Richard May, senior analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo.     The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC\'s, but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end production skills, the analysts said.     \"The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on semiconductors in return for free access to other areas,\" said Edwards.     A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd HIT.T, said the firm\'s reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory (256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI\'s efforts to ward off the trade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of the company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM\'s, he said.     Company officials unveiled the following plans -     - NEC Corp NESI.T, Japan\'s largest chipmaker, plans to slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last quarter.      In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chip imports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip consumption the year before.     - Hitachi Ltd\'s HIT.T April output of 256K DRAM\'s will fall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. The company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific target. Imports are currently very low.     - Toshiba Corp TSBA.T will reduce April 256K DRAM production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is considering ways to boost imports, a company official said.     Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sell the U.S. Firm\'s chips in Japan. The firms are planning a joint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern Japan.     - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim second quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln chips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased imports but an official said \"boosting imports will be difficult as it depends on sales demand.\"     - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord with MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels.     - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce April production by 10 pct from March\'s 3.2 mln. Oki is studying ways to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning April 1 from the previous year\'s total of more than five billion yen, a company official said.  \n',27
'Japan\'s economic policies face fierce international attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its trade surplus, international monetary sources said.     At a meeting this week in Paris, senior government officials from major nations are considering an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) staff report that forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus, they said.     Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the yen\'s sharp rise against the dollar, they still tend to surge when growth picks up, according to the OECD.     As a solution, the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect its export-driven economy, boosting domestic demand and imports by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy, they said.     That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret meetings of the International Monetary Fund\'s executive board.     The monetary sources said Japan\'s policy was criticized when the board met to consider the country\'s economy under the annual consultations it holds with each of its members.     The United States, which until recently has been reluctant to criticize Japan\'s fiscal stance, joined in the attack, he said.     The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese government\'s forecast of 3.5 pct economic growth in the fiscal year beginning April 1. Most independent forecasters, including the IMF, believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below three pct, monetary sources said.     The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic pressure to boost an economy hard-hit by the yen\'s rise. The yen\'s climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge American market.     Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus, which last year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs.     Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said recently. The yen closed here today at 151.53 to the dollar. Most Japanese politicians, including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, are clearly hoping the yen will weaken, government officials said.     At a meeting in Paris last month, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the United States and West Germany, agreed to cooperate to hold currencies at around current levels.     Officials said that wording represented a compromise. Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few months, before it weakens later in the year.     Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value for the dollar, perhaps by substituting the word \"recent\" for \"current,\" while the United States wanted it to more clearly point to the dollar\'s weaker levels now, perhaps by use of the word \"present,\" they said.     In the months leading up the February 22 agreement, the dollar dropped some 10 yen.     The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the market that recent U.S. Action to prevent the dollar from rising above 1.87 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for the U.S. Currency.     Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts, which it says do not take account of the structural changes in the Japanese economy that will be triggered by the strong yen.     Officials said there are already signs of that. More and more companies have announced plans to move production facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad, they said.  \n',27
'Japan is sending a three-man team to Washington to try to halt threatened trade sanctions that officials warn could spark a wave of anti-U.S. Sentiment here.     The team will lay the groundwork for high-level emergency talks next week aimed at defusing an increasingly bitter row over trade in computer microchips, officials said.     \"The sanctions are against the free trade system,\" Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) director general Noboru Hatakeyama told reporters, adding: \"If these measures are taken, the atmosphere in Japan against the United States would become not so good as before.\"     Other officials were more blunt. \"The U.S. Action will have a significant impact on the growing anti-U.S. Feeling (here),\" another MITI official said.     A senior Foreign Ministry official, who declined to be identified, tolds the U.S. Threats have undercut those in the government who argue for conciliation.     \"There is a very strong argument in Japan that since the United States is imposing tariffs unilaterally, why should we bother doing anything,\" he said. \"Anything we do, we will be bashed.\"     The senior official sounded pessimistic about the likelihood of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defusing U.S. Anger over Japanese trade practices when he visits Washington on April 29.     \"I don\'t think trade friction will be solved all of a sudden (by the visit),\" he said.     Nakasone is widely expected to present a package of measures to President Reagan to help contain U.S. Frustration over Japan\'s large trade surplus.     But the senior official played down those expectations.  \n',27
'Japan\'s Minister of International Trade and Industry, Hajime Tamura, will meet representatives from 151 of the nation\'s largest companies next week and appeal to them to do their best to increase imports, ministry officials said.     The meeting was unveiled as part of a plan to boost imports and help head off protectionist legislation in the U.S.     Senior officials from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry told reporters that such personal appeals appeared to have paid off in the past, as Japanese imports of manufactured goods have climbed.     Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips next month in an attempt to help ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.     The officials also said they expect the government\'s new trade insurance law to boost imports and encourage Japanese companies to set up production facilities overseas.     Under the new law, the government will insure Japanese companies who pre-pay for imports against loss arising from everything from war to bankruptcy of the foreign firm they are dealing with. MITI estimated that it would help solve Japan\'s trade problem to the tune of about $10 billion dlrs a year.  \n',27
'Japanese computer chip makers reacted angrily to news the United States plans to take retaliatory action against them for allegedly failing to live up to an agreement on trade in computer microchips.     Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) Chairman Shoichi Saba stated: \"EIAJ believes that it is premature and even irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of the agreement and our efforts to comply with it only six months after concluding the agreement.\"     \"We urge U.S. Governmental authorities to reconsider the decision made, to evaluate fairly the results of Japanese efforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement, and to resist emotional biases,\" he said.     Yesterday, Washington announced plans to slap as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation for what is sees as Japan\'s failure to comply with the terms of the pact.     The agreement, struck late last year after months of heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips on world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.     To salvage the pact, Tokyo has instructed its chip makers to slash production and has helped establish a multi-lateral organisation designed to promote chip imports.     Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged three mln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation and expressed regret that no American company has seen fit to join.     \"This suggests that American semiconductor manufacturers may not be really interested in participating in the Japanese market,\" he said.  \n',27
'Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other.     The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz\'s one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.     Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.     \"We appreciate their frustration,\" a senior Japanese government official said. \"But we are also frustrated.\"     The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said.     He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress.     \"It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments,\" a senior U.S. Official replied.     The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan\'s favour.     On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers.     The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow\'s topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.     These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.     Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.     Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports.     Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. \"It condemns Japan without due process,\" one Japanese official said.     That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.     Japan is also not totally happy with the administration\'s trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said.     Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them.     \"We have no leverage,\" one official admitted.     As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers.     The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market.     The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said.  \n',27
'Jordan and Sudan signed a barter trade agreement under which they will exchange 100 mln dlrs\' worth of goods a year, Sudanese officials said.

'Treasurer Paul Keating forecast economic growth at slightly under two pct in the financial year ending June this year, down from the 2.25 pct forecast contained in the 1986/87 budget delivered last August.     Australia\'s terms of trade also fell, by 18 pct, over the past two years, he told Parliament. Terms of trade are the difference between import and export price indexes.     Despite the figures, the budget forecast of about 1.75 pct annual growth in employment would be met, Keating said.     Unemployment is currently at 8.2 pct of the workforce.     \"This government is dragging Australia through a trading holocaust the kind of which we have not seen since the Second World War,\" Keating said.     \"We are not pushing this place into a recession. We are not only holding our gains on unemployment, we are bringing unemployment down,\" he said, adding that the government had help the country avoid recession.  \n',27
'Australian Treasurer Paul Keating said he expects the country\'s 1986/87 current account deficit to be one billion dlrs lower than the 14.7 billion forecast in the August budget. Keating told a financiers\' dinner that February\'s 750 mln dlr deficit, against January\'s 1.23 billion, was \"in the groove\" of the government\'s expectations.     \"We will probably bring the current account this year under 14 billion, I think, which will probably be about a billion dollars less than we forecast in the budget,\" Keating said. \"I am sure we will see a lower current account deficit for next year ... And a fall as proportion of GDP.\"     Australia posted a 13.82 billion dlr current account deficit in 1985/86 and Keating said the latest monthly figures showed an encouraging trend.     Keating said the government would maintain responsible economic management regardless of whether it was drawn into an election, because it would take time to stabilise Australia\'s 80 billion dlr foreign debt.     \"We have to build the import competing sector back,\" he said. \"We are now trying to rebuild our capital structure. We are trying to rebuild the culture of productivity and manufacturing.\"     Keating said the foundation for a transition of the economy had been laid with the floating of the Australian dollar and continued with wage restraint and deregulation.     The Government would follow with spending cuts in its economic statement on May 14, he said.  \n',27
'The House Ways and Means Committee completed action on legislation to toughen U.S. trade laws, chairman Dan Rostenkowski said.     The committee\'s consideration of one of the most controversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surplus countries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States, was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, its sponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said.     Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, tolds he was not certain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposal would take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10 pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries such as Japan.     The Ways and Means Committess\' trade bill forces President Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate international trade agreements but it allows him to wave retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S. economy.     The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions to grant domestic industries import relief.     It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade practices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These powers are currently held by President Reagan.     The administration has strongly objected to this transfer of authority from Reagan to Yeutter.     The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiate multilateral trade agreements. The bill will be wrapped into other trade legislation and voted on in the House in April.  \n',27
'South Korea will further open its market to help cut its trade surplus with the U.S. And to fight off pressure to revalue the won against the dollar, a government spokesman said.     The spokesman said Korean trade minister Rha Woong-Bae\'s stand in Washington yesterday against pressure from industrial nations to revalue the won underlined the government\'s determination to stand firm.     Rha told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \"Demands that Korea carry out a drastic and sudden currency revaluation of five or 10 pct are, I believe, extremely ill-advised.\"     Deputy prime minister Kim Mahn-Je told a meeting of local businessmen \"The government\'s policy on the question of revaluing the won is to maintain a steadfast position.\"     Kim said South Korea was ready to move slowly to raise the won\'s value because of its heavy foreign debt which stood at 44.5 billion dlrs at the end of 1986.     Six industrialised nations agreed in Paris last month that newly industrialising countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, should allow their currencies to appreciate.     But local businessmen have said won/dollar parity has already reached \"a crisis level.\"     An official of the Korea Traders\' Association (KTA) said if the won strengthened another five pct, this would mean the loss of profitability for nearly half of all South Korean exporters.     \"We are determined not to go the way of Latin American debtor nations which have suspended interest payments of their debts,\" the spokesman said. \"The only way to keep our good record is to maintain our exports.+     The trade minister said yesterday should Seoul revalue the won suddenly Korea would run \"a tremendous trade deficit and could degenerate into a country, like many other developing countries, which is reneging on its international obligations.\"     The spokesman said South Korea had been gradually appreciating its currency, ruling out a major revaluation. So far this year, the won has gone up by 0.8 pct against the dollar after a 3.34 pct revaluation in 1986.     He said South Korea was selecting \"many\" of 122 items on which Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. No further details were given.     Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158 items, including sensitive agricultural products and large cars, effective from July.     South Korea posted its first ever current account surplus last year, due largely to a trade surplus with the U.S. Of 7.1 billion dlrs, against a 4.3 billion deficit in 1985. It earlier forecast that its current account surplus could reach eight billion dlrs this year.     But the government official said the surplus would be held at around five billion dlrs to avoid further pressure by industrialised nations to push up the value of its currency.  \n',27
'South Korean Foreign Trade Minister Rah Woon Bae said his country\'s firms have agreed to buy 1.8 billion dlrs worth of U.S. goods during his two-week buying trip to the United States.     Rah said most of the purchases represented shifts from Japanese firms to U.S. firms as part of South Korea\'s effort to reduce its seven billion dlr trade surplus with the United States.     South Korea has a five billion dlr trade deficit with Japan.  \n',27
'A panel of four leading economists told a congressional hearing today that foreign economies will need to expand to avoid recession as the U.S. trade deficit declines.     C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury Department official, and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the major exporting countries risk recession if they do not expand because U.S. demand for imports is expected to fall.     \"They need to beef up domestic demand as their trade surplus falls,\" or unemployment will keep growing, Bergsten said.     Bergsten predicted the U.S. trade deficit, which hit 169 billion dlrs last year, will fall 30-40 billion dlrs a year for the next two years as a result of the dollar\'s 35-40 pct decline since September 1985.     The government should intervene to push the dollar down further if the previous declines do not lead to an improvement in the trade picture, if the U.S. budget deficit is not reduced and if foreign expansion does not occur, he added.     Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate for the huge interest payments required on U.S. foreign debt. The Paris agreement between the major industrialized countries provided only for a pause in its decline, he said.     Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., said the U.S. trade deficit problem is a problem of lagging growth in industrial economies, prolonged currency misalignment, debt problems of the developing countries, and unbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries.     John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, suggested foreign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack from the U.S. trade deficit fall.  \n',27
'Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said he was considering amending the Senate Finance Committee\'s trade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan for soybeans, corn and wheat.     Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there was great reluctance among members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to reopen the 1985 farm bill, and that a marketing loan might have a better chance in the Finance panel.     The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which in effect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at the world price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in U.S. cotton exports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports.     Pryor serves on both the Senate Finance and Agriculture Committees.  \n',27
'Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford said he did not believe that West Germany and Japan have yet carried out their international responsibilities.     \"I do not believe they have up to this time,\" Mulford told a Senate banking subcommittee.     He said that for the U.S. trade deficit to continue improving in the next two years, \"We need more policy actions\" across the entire front of U.S. trade relations, including Canada and the newly-industrialized countries (NICS).     In particular, he said, efforts by South Korea and Taiwan to strengthen their currencies were still disappointing.     Mulford also said that OECD nations need to grow an average three pct to help resolve the international debt crisis.     He noted that Japanese and European imports from Latin nations were significantly smaller than imports into the U.S.     He stressed both Germany and Japan must continue to take economic and structural measures to ensure stronger sustained economic growth.  \n',27
'Preliminary trade figures for February show an excess of exports over imports of 119.1 mln N.Z. Dlrs, a Statistics Department statement said.

Exports rose to 998.4 mln dlrs, from 889.2 mln (revised from 889.5) in January and 903.2 in February 1986. Imports dropped to an estimated 879.4 mln dlrs from 892.5 (revised from 891.2) in January and 939.3 in February 1986.

'Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S. Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim.     Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S. President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said.     News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier.     It also came one day after the Reagan Administration\'s Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips.     Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one designed to pep up Japan\'s sagging economy and imports in the short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth.     But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day.     Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.     But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.     Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own measures.     He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the government\'s plans, without losing face in parliament over the budget, political analysts said.     Officials working on the government\'s short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.     They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first half, probably over 80 pct.     Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit.     To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japan\'s longer-term economic plans.     A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.     Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawa\'s report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy, officials said.     While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible, they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee\'s recommendations.     A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japan\'s total output, or gross national product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct of gnp.     The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993, from 150 now.  \n',27
'Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone intervened to try to resolve Japan\'s escalating dispute with the U.S. Over semiconductor trade, government officials said.     At today\'s Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan\'s unfair trade practices in semiconductors.     Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration\'s Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S.     That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.     Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action.     Yesterday, Tamura\'s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan\'s case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output.     In his letter, the contents of which were released today, Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets.     In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets.  \n',27

'Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in Japan\'s increasingly bitter row with the United States over trade in computer microchips.     \"Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected,\" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying.     While expressing regret over America\'s decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute.     Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.     Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.

'Ministers from more than 20 nations were told by New Zealand that the next international negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this century and the cost of failure could not be measured.     Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     \"We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system,\" he said.     \"We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all,\" Moore said.    \"The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000,\" he added.     The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the \"Uruguay round\" talks last September. The talks are  also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice.     The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round.     The southerners\' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met.     The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected.     Moore said one aim was to \"instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.\"     Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits, as well as preventing \"bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.\"     The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.     The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals:     -- an end to agricultural subsidies;     -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations;     -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and copyrights;     -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT\'s 92 member states.

'Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said current data does not give a clear sign that the deterioration in the U.S. trade balance has yet been reversed.     \"The data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence that the deterioration in the trade balance has yet been reversed,\" Volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a luncheon for community leaders here.     However, Volcker said there are encouraging signs, particularly the rising volume of exports over the past year, achieved despite relatively slow growth abroad.     Volcker warned it is not sustainable from an economic perspective to pile up foreign debt while failing to make the investment needed to generate growth and earn the money to service the debt.     He said the process of restoring external balance to the U.S. economy requires dealing with the budget deficit. He said needed economic adjustment will require a relative shift of financial and real resources into internationally competitive industry. \"More of our growth will need to be reflected in net exports and business investment and less in consumption,\" Volcker said.  \n',27
'Firms need not be pessimistic about export prospects even though foreign markets have become more difficult because of the mark\'s strength the Economics Ministry said.      The ministry\'s parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georg von Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports could start rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing the lower export trend which emerged in mid-1986.     But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be no need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of exports did not affect currently good domestic demand.     Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. \"This is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for stimulative steps,\" he said.     The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to work actively to promote free world trade, he added.     Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good export opportunities. Price alone was not the only factor in international competitiveness, he said, adding German firms have a reputation for high quality standards, prompt delivery times and good service.     Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficult position on its trade figures.  It faced international pressure to reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worried about the effect of the mark\'s strength on the country\'s exporters.     Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas, tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to a record 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise was due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the decline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports have in fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.  \n',27
'Norway\'s parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.     The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway\'s minority Labour government, gives domestic companies until late September to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and Namibia.     \"The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an isolated measure, but as a step in an international process,\" Norway\'s foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament.     Government officials said they hope the move will intensify international pressure against the Pretoria regime\'s apartheid policies. Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to halt all trade with South Africa by October.     Norway\'s boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an important exception for ships whose final destination is decided while they are at sea.     Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading, making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships\' final port at the start of a voyage.     Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued oil shipments to South Africa. They called for stricter sanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa.     Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said.     The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure.     \"Many would say that the law has already had its effect because of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and Norway,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust tolds.     \"Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring its relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law.     \"No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on international trade with South Africa, but it is an important political statement by the Norwegian government,\" he said.     The Oslo government said it will review the effects of the ban on Norwegian industry after two years and may propose amendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law.     Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly to high-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it ferro-alloys and light metals industries.     Metals manufacturers estimate some 2,000 jobs could be affected by the boycott is suitable replacements for these ores are not found.     The legislation now goes on to the upper house for formal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said.  \n',27
'Norway\'s trade deficit widened in February to 957 mln crowns from 80 mln crowns in January and 492 mln crowns in February last year, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.

'The western industrialised nations have agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to subsidise export credits in so-called \"mixed credits,\" the OECD said.     The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for credits covering exports to the world\'s least developed nations.     Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD, which hosted the reform negotiations, said.     Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by July next year.     The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.     OECD officials said the agreement was based on a provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.     By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too costly for frequent use.     \"A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been closed today,\" a senior U.S. Official here commented.  \n',27
'The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.     The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December.     It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year.     The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.     It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.     It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.     It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.     The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged.     It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year\'s 18.4 pct drop.     The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.     \"This is not a crash scenario but the dollar\'s steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing,\" the EIU said.     \"Talking will not stop the dollar\'s slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter U.S. Fiscal policy,\" it said.     It said the key to the dollar\'s fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.     \"Thus far they have been willing,\" the EIC said, adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would collapse.     To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis, it said.     On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look \"increasingly sick.\"     Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said.     The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December, the EIU said.     On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while Japan\'s exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar.     It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.     However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984, the EIU said.     After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.     It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6 pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986.  \n',27

'Philippine Secretary of Trade and Industry Jose Concepcion, who two days ago expressed doubts about agreements produced at international conferences, said he was pleased with the latest gathering here.     Concepcion tolds in an interview that the informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.     \"Also, the role of the developing countries has been emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich countries,\" he added in an interview withs.     \"In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be of more benefit to the developed countries,\" he said.     Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the Uruguay round was meant to be a \"shining act of faith\" in the world trade system.     Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery to make it more responsive.     He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but faced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very high duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South Korea as examples.     He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New Zealand, which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines, to encourage it to switch imports from other countries. He noted that New Zealand bought its bananas from Ecuador.  \n',27
'Philippines Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community (EC) imposed a levy on vegetable oils.     Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted.     He said the EC not only ignored Manila\'s request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but introduced a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries.     Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers, he noted that \"I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value.\"     He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services.     \"The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed,\" he said.  \n',27

'President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States, White House officials said.     There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States, but officials said the move could come today or early next week.     Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan include tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors.     The sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal computers, television receivers and laser-printers, with the aim of penalizing Japan\'s major electronic firms, including NEC Corp, Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Fujitsu Ltd.     They said Reaan could also delay invoking sanctions for a week or two, giving Japan a final opportunity to end the dumping practice, but added that negotiators had already held extensive talks with the Japanese to no avail.  \n',27
'House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.     In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.     But he warned that his \"conciliatory message\" on the trade bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn other countries their access to the American market would be curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.     \"Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,\" Rostenkowski said.     \"It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the American market,\" he added.     However, he said there would likely be changes in the market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.  \n',27
'House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan\'s support.     He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget.     However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year\'s tax reform bill unchanged.     There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the 1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.     Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his 1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax increases.     On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry for special protection.     \"To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,\" he said.     This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was proposed again this year.  \n',27

The current mission is not involved in that area but there are plans to buy \"substantial amounts of cotton\" from the U.S.     He noted his country \"is clearly not as open as the American market.

'Japan has complained to the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that South Korea\'s five-year plan to cut its trade deficit with Japan breaks GATT rules, Trade Ministry officials here said.     They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month alleging South Korea\'s plan to import less from Japan and more from the U.S. And elsewhere was tantamount to creating non-tariff trade barriers.     South Korea unveiled the plan in November. It said it hoped to narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by 1991.     South Korea\'s trade deficit with Japan was a record 5.45 billion dlrs in 1986, and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period.     The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to import Japanese goods, and to exporters to sell more to Japan.     The officials said they believed the Japanese action, one step short of filing a suit, was designed to bring South Korea to the negotiating table and stop the plan.     The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import restrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean goods to help reduce the trade deficit.  \n',27

He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng.     He said Doumeng\'s Interagra company was preparing proposals for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of goods.     Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union\'s food production capacity.  \n',27
'China\'s application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is seen as a test case by the Soviet Union, which will probably demand to follow China, a top European Community official said.     Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of the European Communities, told a news conference that China\'s application would involve long and difficult negotiations.     China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and in February presented a memorandum backing its application, which De Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then be presented to China.     \"After China, other important state-trading countries including the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession. China\'s application could be considered a test case,\" he said.     He said the EC strongly backed China\'s application, but others among GATT\'s 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.     Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economy entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and the expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy without trade discrimination, de Clercq added.     De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two current Socialist GATT members.     On China\'s import potential, he said a foreign exchange shortage would force China to import less this year and next than in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipment and capital.     During his visit, De Clercq has met top Chinese leaders and today signed an agreement to open a European Community Commission office in Peking.  \n',27
'Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European Community levels, director-general of the INFE export institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.     \"The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now,\" he said.      \"This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy, which have a similar productive structure,\" he said.     The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain\'s presence in international trade fairs.     Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted.     Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20 billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the government\'s development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant.     The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.     Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand, which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.     He added that 80 pct of Spain\'s exports went to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries.     The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.     \"The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of EC competition,\" he said.     He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while turning their backs on foreign markets.     \"They have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation,\" he said. \"Foreign companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and it is it vital to secure a market share abroad.\"  \n',27
'Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president\'s council of economic advisors, said stronger domestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to help stimulate U.S. exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines.     \"Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of U.S. export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation,\" he told the Futures Industry Association.     Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war period.     \"Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery,\" he said.     Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners, he said recent figures showed Japan\'s economy grew by about 0.5 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, \"Not enough to sustain employment growth.\"     However, Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies, including tax reform. \"I suspect there will be further moves,\" he said.     Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U.S. government spending and for resistance to tax increases.     \"Reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform,\" he said, adding that \"a vote to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax reform.\"     Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored U.S. cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the U.S. trade balance appeared to have abated.     However, he said that \"sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable,\" as it risks inflation in the United States and recession abroad.     \"I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987,\" he said. Improvements in the U.S. trade balance, he said, will come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and present \"serious adjustment problems for U.S. trading partners.\"     Western Europe, where manufactures output and employment have been weak, promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the U.S. trade balance, Sprinkel said.     He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them.  \n',27
'A free trade pact between the United States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially, according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics.     The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada\'s gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S. export\'s by about seven pct.     He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.     The United States and Canada - the world\'s two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150 billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They are aiming for a pact by next October.     Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of Maryland, said an agreement should include:     - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased in over a five to 10-year period;     - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries, replacing current \"Buy America\" and \"Buy Canada\" provisions with a \"Buy North America\" provision;     - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance and transportation;     - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers;     - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.      Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to 2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.     The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.     He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage.     Wonnacott said \"bilateral free trade would contribute to the efficiency of the North American economies and to their competitiveness in facing overseas producers.     He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass production.     Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to Canada proportionately, he said, because of the already large U.S. gross national product.     Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areas as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write new and more liberal global trading regulations.  \n',27
'Sweden announced its promised program of unilateral economic sanctions against South Africa and gave firms an October deadline to cut trading links.     Foreign Trade Minister Anita Gradin said a trade boycott of South Africa and neighbouring Namibia would take effect from July 1, followed by a three-month period of grace to give companies time to wind down their operations.     From October 1, no direct trade would be allowed in either direction, with certain exceptions covering medical supplies and printed matter, Gradin told a news conference.     She said exceptions would also be granted in cases where a Swedish trade boycott would benefit South African firms and disadvantage South Africa\'s black-ruled neighbours, the front-line states.     Gradin cautioned that legislation upon which the boycott would be based was not impossible to get round. She said a parliamentary committee would investigate ways of closing some of the bigger loopholes, including indirect trade with South Africa via Swedish subsidiaries in third countries.  \n',27

He said the deficit on invisible trade narrowed to 740 mln U.S. Dlrs from 1.97 billion.

'Taiwan said it would soon relax import controls on some 400 foreign items, including stationery and books, in a further effort to allow trading partners, especially the U.S., Greater access to its markets.     Taiwan announced the easing of import curbs on some 600 farm and industrial products last month, a Council for Economic Planning and Development spokesman tolds.     He said the new move was intended to balance trade between Taiwan and its trading partners. The island\'s trade surplus reached a record 15.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year, up from 10.62 billion in 1985.     In January, Taiwan cut import tariffs on some 1,700 foreign products and allowed imports of U.S. Wine, beer and cigarettes.     \"We hope the measures will help reduce our trade surplus this year, especially with that of the U.S.,\" the spokesman said.

The Federation groups all of Taiwan\'s major industrial associations. Last year its members purchased about 4.5 billion U.S. Dlrs worth of industrial products from Japan and about 1.8 billion from the U.S.     The spokesman said Federation members were now discussing the volume of business they could transfer to America.     He said they had drawn up a list of about 80 industrial products they would be shopping for in the U.S. During the buying mission in September, but he could give no figure on how much would be spent.

'Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S., A senior economic planner said.     Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development, tolds Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second half of this year.     Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.     \"We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially,\" he said.     The United States, Taiwan\'s main trading partner, has said the island\'s import tariffs, still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as too selective.      Taiwan\'s trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.     Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan\'s position in talks with Washington over export quotas, particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are among the island\'s main export-earners.     A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of Taiwan textiles.     Under the accord, Taiwan\'s textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988.

'Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Is expected to nearly double to 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1987 and rise to 400 mln dlrs a year by 1991, a five-year forecast by the Economic Ministry showed.     Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Last year totalled 46 mln dlrs, the ministry document said. The investment was mainly in electronics, trading, food and service industries.     Lee Ming-Yi, deputy director of the ministry\'s Industrial Development and Investment Centre, said the forecast rise is due to planned government incentives and growing willingness among Taiwanese to invest abroad.     Lee tolds the incentives, to be introduced in May or June, include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation requirements for businesses seeking to invest in the U.S. To 10 mln Taiwan dlrs from 20 mln.     He said the moves to encourage investment in the U.S. Are part of Taiwan\'s efforts to cut its trade surplus with Washington, which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986 from 1985\'s 10.2 billion.

'Canada\'s decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policy study group said      \"It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period, when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world,\" the Washington-based Atlantic Council said.     U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries, the world\'s biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually.     The council\'s study said the trade talks, with a deadline of October for an agreement, are the biggest issue in U.S.-Canadian relations.    The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties.     The council said \"in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population.\"     But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world.     The council said that in the talks, Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against  allegedly subsidized exports.     A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized.     The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending curbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and the so-called \"cultural industries\" - publishing, broadcasting and films.     It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense cooperation, \"acid rain\" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage.  \n',27
'Tense trade relations with the U.S. And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed European Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here tomorrow.     EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the EC Executive Commission\'s proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations.     The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform package, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this month, of the EC\'s Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as the root cause of the EC\'s persistent financial problems and of tensions with major trading partners.     The proposal is described by its promoters as a stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut cereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward tax.     They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by a fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two billion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm costs.     It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as well as foreign exporters, led by the United States.     The diplomats said the protests had been received from most corners of the developing and developed world, ranging from Senegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Iceland and Norway.     The proposal had little chance of approval by EC governments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as Britain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.     Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and Greece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to the list of products affected.     But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S. And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote anti-EC action, and the foreign ministers\' debate should demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument.     The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the U.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a bill that would curb EC textile exports.     The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, if enacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation.  \n',27

'Japan is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale trade war, government officials said.     \"We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won\'t have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States,\" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said.      On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo\'s alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.     That agreement, reached last year after heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.     Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s planned trip to Washington at the end of April.     While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip\'s success, they said.     \"The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,\" one official tolds. \"We would very much like to do something to respond to that.\"     In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government.     Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute, trade analysts said.     They said that it was an open secret that Japan\'s largest chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact, included enforced production cuts.     The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action.     \"Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the U.S./Japan agreement,\" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan.     He accused the U.S. of being \"irrational.\" He said the U.S. action had made the bilateral chip pact \"meaningless.\"     Saba\'s comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations.     Japan is expected to send a high-level official to Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to go ahead with the tariffs on April 17.     Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry plans to step up purchases of U.S. chips and to propose a joint investigation into U.S. allegations of chip dumping.  \n',27
'Japan is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale trade war, government officials said.     \"We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won\'t have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States,\" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said.      On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo\'s alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.     That agreement, reached last year after heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.     Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s planned trip to Washington at the end of April.     While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip\'s success, they said.     \"The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,\" one official tolds. \"We would very much like to do something to respond to that.\"     In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government.     Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute, trade analysts said.     They said that it was an open secret that Japan\'s largest chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact, included enforced production cuts.

'The House Ways and Means Committee is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws.     The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign unfair trade practices against other domestic industries.     The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge.     The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be approved.      In investigations involving a processed agricultural product, trade associations of processors or producers would have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair duties.      The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture, seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and non-tariff barriers.      President Reagan\'s authority to negotiate a new GATT agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended through January 3, 1991.     The bill extends Reagan\'s authority to negotiate an international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.     It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur before Octoer 1, 1991.     Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be processed within three years after import and exported within five years.     Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from imports.  \n',27
'Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen\'s renewed rapid rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States, political analysts said.     Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), they said.     \"The close relationship between Nakasone and President Reagan was an important element of Nakasone\'s power base,\" Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida tolds. \"So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages Nakasone.\"     Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax.     \"Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from Nakasone,\" Uchida said. \"His position within the LDP itself is not so strongly established today.\"     Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support eroded, the analysts said.     The yen\'s rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in retaliation for Japan\'s alleged violation of a microchip trade pact are now giving Nakasone\'s critics fresh ammunition, the analysts said.     \"Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and Nakasone hasn\'t worked effectively,\" Rei Shiratori, director of the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said.     This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone\'s credibility, Shiratori tolds.     The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen\'s rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said.     \"If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to resign early,\" Shiratori said.     But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29, some analysts said.     However, \"unless the Japanese political system can move more quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very hostile audience,\" said Merrill Lynch Securities economist William Sterling.     \"If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the final nail in his coffin,\" he said.     Reagan\'s own weakened domestic position, and growing Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts said.     But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid Nakasone, they said.     \"One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave,\" Sterling said.  \n',27
'U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April.     In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices.     The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year\'s record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.     Generally, the bill\'s provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws.     The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products in the United States at prices below cost of production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence.     In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.     Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products.     But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties Reagan\'s hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers.     Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee\'s bill was not one \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\" but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse.     The goal of trade legislation was \"to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements,\" he said.     In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.     It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy.     Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.     Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill\'s provisions, but he added, \"Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well.\"     The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S.     The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation.     Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.     AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress.     But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by saying, \"I\'m not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland. I\'m trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president.\"     Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year.     House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.  \n',27

'Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said it is in Japan\'s national interest to make greater efforts to reduce its trade surplus.     He told business executives the most important issues for the world economy are the correction of international trade imbalances and a solution to the world debt problem.     To this end, Japan and the U.S. Must make medium- and long-term efforts to alter economic structures which have expanded the trade gap between the two nations. World economic growth and therefore an expansion of debtor countries\' export markets are needed to solve the debt issue, he added.  \n',27
'Japan today announced another mammoth monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action.     \"The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not moving more quickly,\" Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economist Eric Rasmussen said.     The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus soared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion in January and 4.77 billion a year ago.     The current account surplus, which includes trade in services as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs last month from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago.     After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figures look a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the trade surplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs from a record 9.58 billion in January.     \"In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off further protectionism or further yen strength,\" said William Stirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.     A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on world markets while making imports into the country cheaper.     \"On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making some progress on getting exports down,\" Jardine\'s Rasmussen said.     But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the Japanese economy remains sluggish, he said.     Finance Ministry officials blamed last month\'s slower import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked off stocks they had built up in January.     The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of exports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increase in January.     This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen against the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact on exports, they said.     But economists warned that may not be soon enough for Japan\'s trading partners.  \n',27
'The threatened trade war between the United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin.     But they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip, or whether this week\'s falling share prices mark the start of a \"bear\" market.     \"It\'s the billion dollar question,\" said Richard O\'Brien, economist at American Express International Bank in London.     Japan\'s trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods, may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit.    And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S. Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O\'Brien said. The subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets.     \"A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,\" said O\'Brien. \"Now, it is much less certain.\"     Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O\'Brien.     Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith Barney Harris Upham said  \"We\'re still in a bull market,\" adding that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and \"The bear usually strikes slowly.\"     Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in London, said the huge sums of money going through the world financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.     Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it\'s very difficult to see where else they can put their money than in U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market, according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd\'s bond operation in London.     He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now to the French franc and West German mark.     In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and the dollar\'s slide will mean for securities markets.  \n',27

'Britain and West Germany told their European Community partners they would strongly oppose major elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses.     At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for a full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led protests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said.     West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, will advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance other proposals that could hit German farmers, they added.     They said West Germany\'s objections were put in a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, the president of the EC\'s Executive Commission which had put forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC cash crisis.     Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) - a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports.     Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German farmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult to export to weaker currency states, which means virtually all other 11 EC states, diplomats said.     Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it could seriously damage EC trade relations.     The diplomats said the United States had been the most outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing it as a breach of the EC\'s obligations under the world trade body GATT.     But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC, such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, Iceland and Norway, they added.     Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that could spark a damaging trade war with the U.S.     Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today, diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear that neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this month, they added.  \n',27
'Export Credits Guarantee Department has named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay\'s Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17 years, to the post of executive director, a department spokesman said.     Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.     A drop in the ECGD\'s business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years.     Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern, adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services.     The department\'s annual report for the year ended March 31, 1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.     Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.     The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis, he said. \"Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at.\"     \"You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,\" Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients.     He noted that certain countries have already been removed from the list.  \n',27
'Britain had a visible trade deficit of 2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official statistics show.     Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third quarter shortfall of 930 mln.     For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3 billion stg, sharply up from 1985\'s 2.2. Billion shortfall and a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.     Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday.     The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to 1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion.     In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.     The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO said.     However, 1986\'s surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade increased by 2.1 billion.     The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.     The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions, particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to substantial revisions as later information becomes available.  \n',27
'Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the U.K. Was growing more impatient with Japanese trade barriers and warned that it would soon have new powers against countries not offering reciprocal access to their markets.

'The release of U.K. February trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.     Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply narrower than January\'s 527 mln deficit.     \"The figures are unreservedly good,\" Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.     Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from yesterday\'s close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.     The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling, which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.     But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.     There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\'s forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.     Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.     Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.     However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the Chancellor\'s Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture on imported goods.     However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.     He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry.     The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if January\'s bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres, Harwood said.     U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2 point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries about the figures evaporated.     Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1.5960.     However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.     Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government\'s support was slipping.     The Marplan poll, published in \"Today,\" showed Conservative support had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31 pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party, whose own support fell from 38 pct.     The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent, political observers said.     Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn that today\'s improved sentiment could be dented if support for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.     This upsetting of the markets\' political perceptions, which are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data, Harwood said. \"The news did come as a very, very substantial relief,\" he said.     However, on the interest rate front, economists caution that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed.  \n',27
'Britain\'s visible trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department said.     The current account balance of payments in February showed a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January.     Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln surplus, the same as in January.     Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January.     Trade Department officials said the improvement in Britain\'s current account contrasted with most private forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been expected.     The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January reduced exports that month and that there had been an element of catching up in the February figures.     The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from 114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5.     The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751 mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425 mln from 352 mln.  \n',27
'The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said.     The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by Congress.     Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito.     Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S. Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.     He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three, the spokesman said.     Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S. Complaints about Japan\'s agricultural policy.  \n',27
'The United States has appealed for stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to enforce world trade rules.     The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by the 93-nation body to promote fair trade.     Today\'s meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers 13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and services will take four years to negotiate.     Smith called for boosting GATT\'s links with financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round.     \"The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the world trading system and the global economy,\" Smith said.     \"Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak, or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy.\"     He also also urged that member states be accountable to each other for their trade policies.     Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European Community (EC) officials, tolds the committee wanted to stress GATT\'s importance and did not discuss specifics.     \"We are interested in more periodic ministerial involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings,\" he said.     GATT\'s ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the 12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute panel be set up to review the agreement.     President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay trade round to promote freer trade, has said Washington will impose tariffs against Japanese electronic goods.     He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets to U.S. Exports.  \n',27
'The Semiconductor Industry Association urged the U.S. government to impose trade sanctions against Japan for violating the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement.     In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as of April 1 and continue until the U.S. is satisfied there is full compliance with the agreement.     The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor exports is not what is required.     \"America\'s interests require that agreements be honored and that U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to deliver on its commitments,\" the trade group said.     The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled for Thursday.     The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to foreign-based manufacturers.  \n',27
'The U.S. House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open foreign markets to more U.S. goods.     The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means Committee next week, but major changes are not expected, congressional sources said.     \"This product could very well be toughening our trade policy and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this frightening word \'protectionism\',\" Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.     The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.     But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.     Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House approved his idea to force an annual 10 pct trade surplus cut by those countries.  \n',27
'The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now kept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a threat to U.S. national security.     The Democratic-controlled committee said the administration\'s export control policies, which restrict shipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year\'s record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit.     The committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries.     Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic Policy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year.     \"This is Congress\' number one opportunity to attack the trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more,\" the Washington Democrat said.     The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls.     Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments.     It would also give the Commerce Department primary authority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit the Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing requests to export highly-sensitive technology.  \n',27
'House trade lawmakers took their first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on controversial plans to protect American industries.     Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United States.     The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year\'s effort to force President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs.     Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific trade penalties.     The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it.     Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking his party\'s 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods.     This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances.     \"My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the trade deficit down,\" he told reporters.     The trade law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more competitive.     House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill.     \"I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective bill,\" he told reporters.     The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and to improve education and worker training.     The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S. industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining, safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the country\'s economic development.     They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and whether an injured industry deserves import relief.     They agreed to make it easier for a company to get temporary relief from import competition but agreed the industry should provide a plan to become competitive.     The administration has not announced its support but Yeutter said yesterday, \"I am cautiously optimistic,\" that the Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill.  \n',27
'A key House panel voted to greatly ease government controls on exports as several House committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes.     The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no longer considered important to U.S. military security.     Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S. companies could not sell abroad.     The issue has been the subject of administration debate. The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current controls should be retained but better administered.     Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices.     Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full House in late April.     Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling interest in Schlumberger Ltd\'s Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to expand Reagan\'s authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies.     Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests.     \"We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security,\" subcommittee chairman James Florio, a New Jersey Democrat said.     The subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive government procurement practices.     The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction.     At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese product--digital audio recorders.     Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S. telecommunications products.      Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S. companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and patent laws.                                            \n',27
'The U.S. Is willing to drop tariffs on Japanese electronic imports if Japan shows it will abide by an agreemement opening its markets to American goods, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a TV interview.     \"But there has to be a clear indication that they are willing to act,\" he said.     Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused by the U.S. Tariffs and the yen\'s rise against the dollar are problems \"they have brought on themselves.\"     The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today.     \"Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economic turmoil in Japan,\" he said. \"My only response is that we have gone through about five years with the dollar going in just the opposite direction. Although I can sympathise, it\'s occurred for only a few weeks or months in Japan.\"     The tarriffs, announced on Friday by President Reagan, will affect about 300 million dlrs worth of products, only a tiny fraction of Japan\'s total exports to the U.S.     Even so, Reagan\'s decision \"doesn\'t give us any joy. We don\'t want to take retaliatory action here if we don\'t have to,\" Yeutter said.     Yeutter said the meetings scheduled next month in Washington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will include \"some difficult items on the agenda.\"     Japan has failed to implement two parts of a three-part semiconductor agreement, Yeutter said.     Japan has stopped dumping chips in the U.S. But it has failed to open its domestic markets to U.S.-made chips and has failed to end predatory pricing in Third World countries, undercutting U.S. Products, he said.  \n',27
'Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said he sees \"growing but incomplete evidence that (U.S.) export volumes are finally strengthening.\"     In remarks prepared for a speech today in Los Angeles, Sprinkel said the decline in the dollar\'s value since 1985 had \"largely\" restored U.S. cost competitiveness in world markets and appeared to signal an end to U.S. trade imbalances.     \"I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to U.S. growth in 1987,\" he said.  \n',27
'Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost will visit Tokyo next week for meetings with high-level officials that will include talks on the growing trade row over Japanese semiconductor electronics products.     He is the first high-level U.S. official to visit Japan since President Reagan announced last week plans to impose tariffs worth up to 30 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods on April 17 in retaliation for Tokyo\'s alleged failure to live up to a pact on microchip trade signed last September.     Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the trip is set for April 6 to 8.     U.S.-Japanese talks of this kind are regularly held each year at this time, she told reporters.     The Armacost discussions with Deputy Foreign Minister Ryohei Murata and other senior Japanese officials will focus on U.S.-Japanese foreign aid programs and political security issues of mutual concern, she added.     \"Although an exchange of views on bilateral relations is expected, the talks are not directly related to U.S.-Japanese trade relations,\" she insisted.     But, in response to questions, Oakley acknowledged that trade will be discussed.    Japan\'s 58.6 billion dlrs trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress, which is concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. Trade deficit in 1986.  \n',27
'The dollar will decline over the next two to three years, but this is unlikely to result in a complete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, said Anthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.     In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon said without elaboration that he expects a \"significant decline in the dollar,\" within the next three years.     \"The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficit will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,\" he said.     Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited several factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit.     For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.     In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes.     Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but said it could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil prices are stable and commodity values remain low.  \n',27
'The U.S. Expects more harmonious talks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac\'s first official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes between the two countries begin to fade.     \"The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade war didn\'t happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation on terrorism,\" one U.S. Official tolds.     \"It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect, more harmonious than usual.\"     Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the United States.     During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in Libya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S. Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a circuitous route. That angered Washington.     The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong enough action against terrorism. \"Now they are. We\'re pleased and they are pleased that we are pleased,\" one said.     More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European Community  threatened to become a trade war.     In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.     Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad, supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases in northern Chad.     A French official added: \"There is also a common interest in getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the world by opening up its markets.\"     Although relations have improved markedly between the two countries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the Community\'s common agricultural policy (CAP).     To Washington, as one official put it, \"CAP is the root of all evil\" in international food trade because it subsidises farmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world prices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.  \n',27
'The Senate\'s Democratic and  Republican leaders praised President Reagan for retaliating against Japan for violating a semiconducter accord but dashed cold water on ideas it was the first shot in a trade war.     Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd and Republican leader Bob Dole both told the Senate Reagan\'s decision was long overdue and urged Japan to open its markets to U.S. goods and stop dumping on world markets.     Each noted in separate speeches that they saw no trade war over the issue, despite concerns in financial markets.     \"That fear has no basis in fact,\" Byrd said.  \n',27
'The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee approved a bill that would establish farm trade and aid missions to promote the use of U.S. food aid, donation, credit and export subsidy programs by overseas customers.     The bill, approved by voice vote, would establish trade missions made up of representatives of the Departments of Agriculture and State, the Agency for International Development, the Overseas Private Investment Corp, market development cooperatives and private voluntary organizations.     At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one year after enactment of the bill. The missions would promote U.S. programs, including PL480, Section 416 donations, Export Enhancement Program, the dairy export incentive program, and export credit guarantee programs (GSM-102, GSM-103).     The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill, offered by Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), that would have required the U.S. Agriculture Department to donate at least one mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries.     Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750,000 tonnes of surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 food donation program.     The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up to 50 mln dlrs per year, Senate staff said.     The committee also dropped a provision identifying which countries would be the focus of the trade missions\' activities.     Under the bill adopted by the committee, countries \"friendly to the United States\" would be eligible to host the trade missions.     Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico, the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Nigeria, Peru, Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco.     The bill also would require the Foreign Agricultural Service, FAS, to have at least 850 full-time employees during fiscal years 1987-89. As of February 28, FAS had 790 full-time employees, a FAS spokesman said.  \n',27
'The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee may take up a bill tomorrow that would strengthen the activities of U.S. agricultural trade teams in selected developing countries, committee staff said.     The measure, sponsored by committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), would establish trade teams of between six and nine persons drawn from federal agencies and private voluntary organizations, staff said.     The trade missions would seek to generate interest in the U.S. government\'s food donation and commercial programs -- PL480, Section 416, export credit and export enhancement -- and upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional or commercial benefits to interested countries.     The trade teams would be made up of representatives of the U.S. Agriculture Department, State Department, the Agency for International Development and private voluntary organizations such as U.S. Wheat Associates.     The bill would require teams within six months to visit seven countries: Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria.     Within one year after passage of the measure, another eight countries would have to be visited: Peru, Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco. Other countries could be added to the list.     Senate staff members said the bill, still in the drafting stages, had broad support and was expected to be approved by the committee tomorrow.  \n',27
'The chairman of the U.S. Senate committee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concerned about a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted by the Canadian House of Commons last week.     The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading agreement with the United States while protecting Canadian political sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketing systems, the auto industry and Canada\'s cultural identity.     Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free trade agreement between the two countries, which are each other\'s largest trading partners.     \"We need a truly free trade agreement, which means both countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually beneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement,\" the Texas Democrat said in a statement.     \"I do not question Canada\'s right to protect its political sovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrases mean the government of Canada means to take important economic issues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeply concerned,\" he added.     Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways while the United States uses only six trade restriction methods. He said if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries get rid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fair and might not win Senate approval.     \"I am deeply concerned that when the President visits Prime Minister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented with this kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear -- as I did when I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficial agreement will be successful,\" Bentsen said.     Reagan and Mulroney are scheduled to meet April 5-6 in Ottawa.     Bentsen urged Mulroney to withdraw a proposal that would ban imports of independently produced films into Canada by non-Canadians, which the senator called a protectionist measure.  \n',27
'The United States will likely impose sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators said today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige.     Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision would be taken until a final determination is made on whether Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they said they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties.     President Reagan\'s trade policy advisory group, of which Baldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday.     \"I am confident we will see action taken,\" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, told reporters.     \"I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more than sanctions,\" Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said.     The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department officials to discuss Japan\'s alleged violations of a September 1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United States and other countries.     They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for continuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100 mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said.     Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen. Pete Wilson told reporters, \"The clear import of what he said is that there will be.\"     \"Japan can\'t just say they will comply. We think sanctions must be applied,\" for past violations of the agreement, the California Republican said.     The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips which are used in high technology products ranging from radios to defence missile guidance systems.     Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige told them the administration had not made a final determination that Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below the cost of production in the United States or other countries.     But McClure said senators told him, \"There is no doubt dumping is going on,\" based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the Japanese products.     The two countries signed a pact last September in which Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United States and other countries below production costs and to allow the U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market.     In return, the United States waived its right to impose import duties on the Japanese microchips.     Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact and have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to save the pact.     Japan has frequently been the target of congressional discouragement over last year\'s record 169-billion-dlr trade deficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United States last year and had large surpluses with other countries.     The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution calling for action against Japan for violations of the pact since September. The resolution will be introduced in the House next week by Rep. Bob Matsui, a California Democrat.  \n',27
'Leading U.S. farm state senators are seeking to insert into the Senate\'s omnibus trade bill a provision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s export enhancement program, EEP, to include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, including the Soviet Union, Senate staff said.     Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies to recoup export markets lost to competing nations\' unfair trading practices.     Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be eligible for the subsidies, sources said.     The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), David Pryor (D-Ark.), John Melcher (D-Mont.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) -- also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork producers and processors from Canadian imports.     The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), would clarify the definition of \"industry\" in determining whether or not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers.     Grassley\'s bill stems from a 1985 decision by the International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live swine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harming U.S. producers.

Speaking to reporters prior to testifying at a House Agriculture Committee hearing, Yeutter said it is \"difficult to comprehend\" that a trade decision affecting only 300 mln dlrs in goods caused the stock market collapse yesterday.     \"I have a hunch a lot of other things were involved in that (stock market fall), including simple profit-taking,\" Yeutter said.     Yeutter said Japan would be sending a senior official from its trade ministry to Washington next week for talks on the computer chip dispute.     \"We will be glad to have him here, but that\'s not going to affect a decision that\'s already been made,\" Yeutter said.     The decision announced last week would apply higher tariffs on a range of Japanese products in retaliation for the alleged failure of Tokyo to honor an agreement with the U.S. on semiconductor trade.  \n',27
'U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to reduce its large trade surplus with the United States.     \"Our central message to Japan this week was that while we have made progress in some areas, much needs to be done,\" he told a press conference after three days of talks.     \"What we need is a resolution of trade issues, we need visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more imports and we need greater domestic-led growth.\"     Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year, Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce its trade surplus, which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986.     He named several areas of particular concern to Washington -- computer microchips, supercomputers, Kansai airport, agricultural products and car telephones.     He warned that the U.S./Japan agreement governing trade in semiconductors was in jeopardy. Despite the pact, Japanese producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other than the United States while U.S. Penetration of the Japanese market has not increased, he said.  \n',27
'A high level U.S. trade official said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor electronics products.     Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliate against U.S. exports, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce Smart replied, \"That would be the height of foolishness.\"     In addition, he doubted Japan could show enough progress in meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual imposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17.     Japan\'s 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986.     President Reagan\'s sanctions decision won praise today from the two Democratic leaders of Congress.     \"I think it\'s about time,\" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House session, \"It just shows we were right all along when we said something needs doing.\"     Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing that last Friday\'s U.S. trade action would help U.S. negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts.     Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up Japan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Last year, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States in these products.     Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987.     \"It\'s amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. I hope it will persuade them we\'re serious,\" Smart said of the White House trade sanctions.     The United States has tried to convince Japanese car companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers.     \"All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading them we can do better than our reputation seems to be,\" he said.     Measured per car, each American-made car contained about 700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car contained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said.  \n',27
'U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said an agreement has been reached by members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to control the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promote trade.     He said in a statement the agreement culminates the Reagan administration\'s effot to negotiate a virtual end to export credit subsidies.     The practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed credits to promote exports has cost the United States lost jobs and lost exports, the Treasury said.     The agreement to be implemented in two stages by July, 1988 would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries and place limits on permitted aid by developing countries.     It would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor countries, the Treasury said.     Baker said the agreement imposes particular sacrifices on Japan and praised Japan\'s willingness to accept the pact as a demonstration of the Japanese government\'s willingness to take concrete steps to resolve important trade issues.  \n',27
'U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said that he opposes a Federal tax increase to help reduce the budget deficit and favors spending cuts instead.     \"I don\'t think it\'s (a tax increase) is a very good idea and I\'m quite confident that President Reagan doesn\'t think it\'s a very good idea,\" Baker said in an interview on Cable News Network\'s \"Moneyline\" television program.     He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP which is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker said spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.     Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes.     \"The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate approach to take,\" the Treasury Secretary said. He said the United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in the world and new taxes would impair efficiency.     On the international front, Baker said banks must do more lending to developing countries. He was questioned about this after the Standard and Poor\'s Corp downgrading today of the debt of six major money center bank holding companies, largely because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure.     Baker said that developing countries must adopt free market economic policies such as in the United States. He said capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the economic systems of those countries.     The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker said that developing nations\' \"investment regimes do not support enough equity investment, so you\'ve got to have some debt there.\"     Commenting on the U.S. trade deficit, Baker said \"I think you\'re going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction this year.\"  \n',27
'Leading industrial nations will be reviewing the Paris agreement to stabilize exchange rates, foster increased worldwide growth and reduce trade imbalances but the U.S. thinks the accord has been successful so far, a senior U.S. Treasury official said.     \"The Paris accord will be reviewed at this meeting. It has been successful and continues to be succesfull,\" a senior U.S. Treasury official told reporters.     In a briefing ahead of this week\'s semiannual IMF and World Bank meetings, he also said the U.S. was looking to West Germany and Japan to bolster their economic growth.     The official said both surplus countries, like West Germany and Japan, and deficit countries, like the U.S., agreed to play a role in bringing about more balanced economic growth.     He reaffirmed the U.S. would press ahead with efforts to reduce its budget deficit, resist protectionism and boost U.S. competitiveness.     The official also said that he expected trade issues, like the dispute between the U.S. and Japan over microchips, to be included in the discussions.     The official made no direct comment on the content or schedule of forthcoming Group of Five and Group of Seven discussions. He said that industrial countries are concerned that the large external imbalances remain a threat to the international monetary system.     He added that the meetings will also provide an opportunity to discuss economic policy coordination efforts.     The official said indicators would be used to measure policy objectives of industrial countries and their economic projections.     They would also be used to assess progress of policy goals.     Asked whether the U.S. was proposing a new initiative regarding the indicators, the official said the issue would be reported to the Venice Summit in June. Monetary sources said the U.S. proposal envisages using the indicators to make policy coordination agreements, like the Paris Accord, more binding.  \n',27
'Exports of American wine rose 14.9 per cent last year to a total of 7.2 million gallons, the Wine Institute said.     The San Francisco-based promotional group said 95 per cent of the exported wine was from California and the top three markets were Canada, Japan and Britain.     Japan, which edged out Britain as the leading importer of American wines in 1985, continued in second place.     Canadian imports rose 3.2 per cent to 2.6 million gallons; Japan, 9.9 per cent to 1.2 million gallons, and Britain, 20.2 per cent to 962,360 gallons.     A spokesman for the institute said the declining value of the dollar and strong promotional efforts on the part of the California wine industry contributed significantly to the increased shipments.     The 1986 wine exports were valued at 34.7 mln dlrs, up from 27.6 mln dlrs the previous year.                \n',27
'U.S. and Japanese officials meet tomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor trade and to cut short the 300 mln dlr penalty tariffs President Reagan has ordered imposed on Japanese exports.     But U.S. officials held out little hope that any accord could be reached before the tariffs of 100 per cent - up from about five per cent - are to take effect on April 17.     The Customs Bureau last week started to levy a bond on the Japanese goods that Reagan ordered penalized. The penalties would be retroactive to March 31.     Reagan said on March 27 when ordering the tariffs that he hoped the Japanese would soon end their unfair practices in semiconductor trade and that sanctions could be lifted.     Technical meetings are to be held today and tomorrow, with meetings at a more senior level scheduled for Thursday and Friday. Public hearings on the sanctions are set for April 13.     The Japanese aides here for the technical talks include Shigeru Muraoka, director-general of international trade policy of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), and Masashi Yamamoto, deputy director-general of the information and machinery bureau.     Meeting with them will Glen Fukushima, director of the Japan office of the U.S. Trade Representative\'s Office, and Jim Gradoville, of trade representative\'s office of industry and services.     The two sides in the Thursday and Friday talks will be headed by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and MITI vice minister Makoto Kuroda.      \n',27
'The United States and Japan are not involved in a trade war, despite U.S. sanctions announced last week against Japanese semiconductors, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.     \"In my judgement, we\'re not even close to a trade war,\" Yeutter told a House Agriculture Committee hearing.     Yeutter said if Japan takes action to honor its agreement with the U.S. on semiconductor trade, \"Then the retaliatory response will last a relatively short period.\"     Yeutter said Japan must stop dumping chips in third countries and buy more American computer chips.  \n',27
'The British government may revoke the licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London\'s financial City when they come up for renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up Japan\'s markets to foreign competition, government sources said.     \"We can\'t say \"yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)\" but this is definitely being considered,\" an official said.     His comments came after the government was formally urged today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint retaliatory action with the United States against Japan.     Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese trade practices. \"There\'s a sense of urgency here now, but the emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in Japan,\" another government official tolds.     Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access.     She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said.     The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7 billion stg, official figures show.     A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged the U.K. Government to \"coordinate action with the President of the United States, and through the Department of Trade and Industry, to suspend all further applications from Japanese communications companies for equipment approval by the British Approvals Board for Telecommunications, and all further applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences\" until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called \"restrictive conditions\" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC) (cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in Japan\'s international telecommunications market.     The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section of MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament. Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on the Conservative government to take firm action.     Officials said another option now being considered by the U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese institutions. That could be done under the government\'s proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.     58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.     The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied under legally-binding international trade agreements.     \"The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in investment, banking and insurance,\" one official said.     \"This point has been made to the Japanese at official level a number times,\" the official added.     Britain and France are now working together to urge that the European Community take collective action against Japan, but by working within EC treaties, another official said.     British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio interview that the European Community should build barriers against Japanese imports through certification procedures similar to those facing European exporters in Japan.     \"There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer,\" he said, adding \"(such barriers) can\'t be put in place overnight.\" Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade \"strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness.\"     The situation is only likely to worsen following news that Japan\'s trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.     But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.     Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global business centre, government sources said. Japan\'s four largest securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.     In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.     There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the move could come today or early next week.     Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors.    \n',27
'The U.K. government hopes for a breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies during next week\'s visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard, political sources said.     Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, tolds he will try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit.     Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in solving the row over a U.K. firm\'s bid to win a significant role in Japan\'s telecommunications market, government sources said.     Tensions have risen following Britain\'s decision to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain Japanese financial institutions.     Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc, government officials said.     But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo that Nakasone\'s assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of British anger, they added.  \n',27
'The European Community may decide to increase the cereals co-responsibility levy and extend its scope to cover cereal substitutes if the Commission\'s 1987/88 farm price package is opposed by member states, Edgar Pye, vice-president of the British agricultural merchants\' association UKASTA, said.     At the moment the Commission is proposing the rate of levy remain unchanged at three pct - but Pye, addressing a feed manufacturers\' dinner in Glasgow, said this could change if its controversial plans to cut cereal prices and introduce an oils and fats tax are blocked     Pye said UKASTA would continue to fight the cereals levy \"tooth and nail.\"     However, a test case in the European Court of Justice contesting the legality of the current regulation applying the levy, which is being backed by the EC feed manufacturers\' organisation FEFAC, was not now expected to be heard until the end of 1987, he said.  \n',27
'William Bywater, president of the International Union of Electronic Workers, called on President Reagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices in semiconductor trade.     He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from becoming \"one of the world\'s industrial lightweights.\"     Bywater\'s remarks came as the White House Economic Policy Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged  violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement.     The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to end selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to forego antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.     But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.     Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action, ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to force prices up and end the dumping.     Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the U.S. industory more competitive.     But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to pass and that action was required now to help the depressed electronic industry.     Bywater said, \"I urge the Reagan Administration to take full and severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the retaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).\"  \n',27

'Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in laying the groundwork for economic growth, but a solution to world debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new financing.     \"There is clearly a danger that adequate financing arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a timely way,\" Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee.     The borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with confidence that the necessary funds will be available to them, he said.     Brazil has the potential for becoming a leading world economic power, but it is in a difficult position today, Volcker said.

Exports to developing nations and centrally-planned economies also slackened.     Separately, Commerzbank AG said in a report that the focus of West German exports this year was likely to shift to Europe because of an expected downturn in growth in the dollar area.

'President Reagan has reaffirmed his opposition to protectionism and his chief spokesman said trade sanctions imposed on Japan were unlikely to start a trade war.     \"We don\'t want to go down that road,\" Reagan was quoted as telling Prime Minister Jacques Chirac after the visiting French official expressed concern about the rising tide of protectionist sentiment in the United States.     Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the new sanctions against Japan and said administration officials \"do not believe this will result in a trade war.\"     \"It is the first time that the United States has taken an action of this type and it is significant but it is nothing to be alarmed about,\" the presidential spokesman added.     \"We do not want protectionism ...

'The White House Economic Policy Council decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan for violations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement, industry sources said.     They would give no details, noting that the White House had not commented on the decision. The administration has been under pressure to retaliate.     There was no immediate announcement on the council\'s decision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the senior policy group\'s move on curbs reflected growing American frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices.     U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on the recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aides on the foreign policy implications of retaliation.     The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached last July governing trade in semiconductors.     Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to U.S.-made semiconductors.     In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments.     The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S. Market but has continued in third countries, and that the Japanese market remains closed.     The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese high technology products containing semiconductors.

Conable said additional commercial bank investment would also be to Japan\'s advantage.     It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus into Third World economies -- notably those in South America, China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than those in the developed world, he said.     Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank\'s concessionary lending affiliate, the International Development Association (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand its contribution to another affiliate, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted.     Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structural adjustment loans, designed to encourage developing countries to open their economies more to free competition and trade.     \"Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bank loans) in the near future, though maybe not this year,\" Conable tolds after his speech.

Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Yeutter said \"Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now.     \"Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the trade deficit down.\"     He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits.     Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S. budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser extent, other U.S. securities as well.     \"We\'ll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987, but there\'s still a long way to go,\" Yeutter said.     He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and the establishment of a \"level playing field\" for trade.     The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down.     On the fiscal side, Yeutter said \"the budget deficit is still our biggest problem\" and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit.     In the international area, he said that \"our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth.\" Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said \"Japan is just not doing the job on the import side.\"     Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner.     In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.     \"The market will determine the dollar\'s proper value in the end,\" Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S. trade deficit, \"the dollar will be the equalizer.\"     Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers.     He said \"there\'s relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem.\"     Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said.     \"There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation,\" Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems.  \n',27
'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining U.S.-Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April.     \"We are having high level discussions on them (the issues) within the United States...The relationship on some of those is very strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date,\" he said.     \"I am not sure we can wait until late April,\" he added.     Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT).     He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries.     Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors, Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy U.S. Super-computers and the barring of U.S. Firms from the eight billion U.S. Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka.     The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country.     \"I am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction. The question is how far and how fast,\" Yeutter said.  \n',27
'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).     Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture.     Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.     Yeutter said \"at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.\"     There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and \"a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there,\" Yeutter said.     However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.     \"It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy,\" he said.     He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he said.     Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process, but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.     It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources, he said.     Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations, he said \"one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it\'s going to have to be as part of a larger package.\"  \n',27
'The United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade, especially over semiconductors, Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U.S. Super-computers, and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.     He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks.     European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world\'s three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT.     Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes.     New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts.     Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. \"Countries don\'t get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future.\"     He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. \"That\'s a very healthy development,\" he added.\"If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist.\"     \"Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit,\" Yeutter said.     \"They\'ve also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago.\"     He added, \"Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter.\"  \n',27
'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter stressed the importance of trade negotiations to open foreign markets rather than trade restrictions in a statement to the Senate Finance Committee.     \"In the long term we cannot repeatedly bludgeon other nations into opening their markets with threats of U.S. restrictions. Rather, we must be able to negotiate credibly for global liberalization,\" Yeutter said.     Yeutter did not mention the recent U.S. trade sanctions against Japanese semiconductors in his testimony on the pending trade bill.     Yeutter said the trade bill should increase U.S. competitiveness, aid U.S. trade negotiating leverage, and avoid provoking foreign retaliation.     He urged Congress to reject provisions that would mandate U.S. retaliation against foreign unfair trade practices.     Yeutter emphasized the importance of the new multilateral trade negotiating round and called on Congress to quickly approve an extension of U.S. negotiating authority.     \"We want to open foreign markets and establish and enforce rules of international competition, not foster dependence on protection and subsidies,\" he said.  \n',27

'Australia\'s official reserve assets fell to the equivalent of 8.50 billion U.S. Dlrs in February, from 9.15 billion in January, compared with 9.06 billion a year earlier, the Reserve Bank said.     In Australian dollar terms, reserves fell by 1.24 billion dlrs to 12.60 billion after falling 1.71 billion to 13.85 billion in January and rising 792 mln to 12.92 billion in February 1986.     The bank said that excluding valuation effects, it estimated reserves fell 853 mln dlrs after falling 2.34 billion in January and rising 323 mln a year earlier.     The individual value of reserve assets in Australian dollars at end-February with end-January and year-earlier respectively in brackets were.

'Thailand\'s improving economy will likely cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at end-February, private bankers said.     Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.     Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the Bangkok Bank Ltd, said Thailand\'s strong export performance, its relatively high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market, and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan, contributed to the projected sharp rise.     Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.     A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.     Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.     Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold, special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target is equivalent to five-and-a-half months\' worth of imports.  \n',27
'The Bundesbank\'s gross currency reserves rose 300 mln marks in the last week of March to 104.9 billion marks, the Bundesbank said in a statement.     At the same time its foreign liabilities rose 100 mln to 22.8 billion, producing a rise in net reserves of 200 mln to 82.2 billion on March 31.     The Bundesbank provided banks with liquidity in the fourth March week by disbursing funds in the money market via government-owned banks. Banks took up the Bundesbank\'s standing offer of treasury bills to place excess liquidity.     Banks received more liquidity through routine month-end payments by public authorities as well as expansionary market factors than was lost through the 2.3 billion mark rise in cash in circulation to 122.3 billion, the Bundesbank said.     But banks had to draw heavily on the Lombard emergency financing facility due to month-end tightness, borrowing 5.3 billion marks.     Overall, banks\' holdings at the Bundesbank rose 10.2 billion marks to 58.5 billion at the end of the month, averaging 50.9 billion in the whole of March.     The minimum reserve requirement for March, before deduction of banks\' cash holdings, was set at 61 billion marks.     Public authorities\' net holdings at the Bundesbank fell to 2.2 billion marks in the last March week from 4.4 billion the week before. The federal states\' holdings fell 2.6 billion to 2.4 billion.     The federal government\'s holdings rose 700 mln marks to 5.1 billion.  \n',27
'Burma\'s debt service ratio will have fallen to 48.8 pct in the fiscal year to end-March 1987 from 50 pct in 1985-1986, the official Council of People\'s Inspectors (CPI) reported.     Western diplomats in Rangoon estimate the figure at above 70 pct and say the country can no longer depend on foreign exchange reserves to cover more than a few weeks\' imports.     The CPI, which oversees government spending, said in its latest report to parliament that foreign currency reserves fell to a record low of 407.9 mln kyats in September 1986 from 430.3 mln in March 1986. Earlier figures were not available.     Debt servicing cost Burma 1.62 billion kyats in 1985-1986 while foreign exchange earnings -- export revenues plus loans and aid -- totalled 3.23 billion kyats in the same period, the council said.     Later figures were not available.     Burma, which diplomats here say now has foreign debts of up to 3.4 billion dlrs, has applied to the United Nations to be reclassified as one of the world\'s least developed countries in order to qualify for softer loan and grant aid.  \n',27
'Canadian foreign reserve holdings rose 1.23 billion U.S. dlrs in March to 7.77 billion dlrs, the Finance Department said.

'French official reserves rose 12.73 billion francs to 388.68 billion francs at the end of February from 375.95 billion at the end of January, the Finance Ministry said.     It said in a statement the rise was mainly due to inflows of foreign currency through the exchange stabilisation fund, which resulted in an increase of 12.41 billion francs.

'French official reserves fell 45.06 billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from 421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.     It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the European Monetary System (EMS).     Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs during the month, the ministry said.     This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund, counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).     But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a result of using very short-term financing instruments.     The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the franc.     On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.     The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves to 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74 billion at end December.     Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.     Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billion francs from 75.27 billion at end December.     Claims on the International Monetary Fund fell 219 mln francs to 19.31 billion francs.  \n',27
'French reserves fell in the week ended March 19 following repayment of the bulk of the debt contracted during January with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, the Bank of France said in its weekly statement.     The repayment of capital and interest on this loan, taken out during the strong pressure on the franc which preceded the European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and the subsequent Group of Five meeting in Paris, took place on March 13.     It comprised the repayment of 11.25 billion francs\' worth of European Currency Units (ECUs), 9.72 billion francs\' worth of foreign currency and 1.72 billion francs\' worth of special drawing rights (SDRs), the Bank said.     As a result foreign currency reserves fell to 114.69 billion francs on March 19 from 120.82 billion on March 12, while ECU reserves fell to 62.02 billion francs from 73.23 billion.

'The net position of federal states worsened in the first March week, cutting public authority net holdings at the Bundesbank by 500 mln marks, the central bank said.     States\' cash deposits at the central bank fell to 800 mln and they also drew down 1.2 billion marks in book credit, 900 mln marks more than in the prior week.     By contrast, however, the federal government was able to reduce its credit drawdown at the central bank by 900 mln marks to 900 mln.     Despite the stronger states\' net needs in the week, their cash position and other market dependent influences just about balanced the outflow of liquidity from the money market through an increase in cash in circulation, the Bundesbank said.     Cash in circulation rose by 1.4 billion marks in the week to 122.9 billion.     Liquidity also came in through the maturing of short-term treasury bills bought from the Bundesbank in the prior week.     Gross currency reserves rose in the week by 400 mln marks to 109.9 billion. Foreign liabilities of the Bundesbank were largely unchanged at 22.8 billion marks, giving a rise in net currency reserves of 400 mln to 87.0 billion, it said.

'Additional capital inflows of 1.5 billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico\'s reserves to about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters.     Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has forced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986.     Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of funds available for badly needed investment.     Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months, Gurria noted.     Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on the commercial banks\' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support contingency facility. That money will be available until April 1988 if Mexico\'s export receipts and the price of oil fall below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said today, \"We expect we\'ll never have to use it.\"     Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World Bank.     Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods.     He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month.     Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results.     Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF for the rest of 1987.     Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris Club.     Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella agreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs of official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks.     In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, he said all countries from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development have continued to provide export credit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.  \n',27

The state must set an example by keeping wage increases below the inflation rate, he said.     Consumer prices rose by 16.1 pct in the year to January.  \n',27
'A Bank of Spain spokesman qualified a bank statement announcing an extension of reserve requirements to convertible peseta funds held by banks, saying the move applied only to future rises above current balances.     \"The 19 pct reserve requirement will only be applied to further increases in bank\'s convertible peseta funds,\" the spokesman said. Convertible peseta funds previously were exempt from reserve requirements. The spokesman said the measure was intended to curb an influx of short-term foreign speculative capital which threatened the government\'s money supply growth target.  \n',27
'Increased activity by Switzerland\'s banks pushed net capital exports to a provisional 11.7 billion francs last year from 10.0 billion in 1985, the National Bank said in a pre-publication copy of its annual report.     It also said the current account surplus of the Swiss balance of payments reached a provisional 13.5 billion francs last year, from 12.8 billion in 1985.     The National Bank\'s currency reserves rose by 1.8 billion francs, against a 2.8 billion rise in 1985. However, taking into accounts effects of the shift in exchange rates, reserves actually fell in value by 1.9 billion.     The banks\' net capital exports climbed to 5.4 billion francs, from 5.1 billion in 1985, while capital exports by domestic non-banks fell to 5.0 billion from 9.1 billion.     The National Bank gave the following figures (1985 in brackets)     Current Account +13.5 billion (+12.8 in 1985), made up of:     Goods                     -7.1 (-8.7)     Services                  +10.1 (+9.8)     Factor Income             +12.5 (+13.7)     Transfers                 -2.0 (-2.0)  Capital Account -11.7 billion (-10.0 in 1985) made up of     Direct Investment                          N/A  (-6.3)     Portfolio Investment                       N/A  (-2.8)     Capital Traffic of Banks                  -10.4 (-14.2)     Other Capital Traffic Included             N/A  (+5.6)     Traffic not Included and Statistical Error N/A  (+7.7)     Change in Currency Reserves of the National Bank +1.8 (+2.8)     Interest Income on Foreign Currency        +2.4 (+3.4)     Foreign Currency Transactions              -0.6 (-0.6)  \n',27
'Sight deposits by commercial banks at the Swiss National Bank rose by 3.10 billion Swiss francs to 10.53 billion in the last 10 days of February, the National Bank said.     Foreign exchange reserves fell 3.06 billion francs to 30.64 billion.     Sight deposits are an important measure of Swiss money market liquidity.     The decline in foreign exchange reserves reflected the dismantling of swap arrangements, the National Bank said.

'Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves, swollen by strong trade surpluses to a record 53 billion U.S. Dlrs, are becoming a problem, government officials said.     Official figures show the latest level compares with the previous record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26 billion in late March 1986.     Central bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the increase in reserves was the result of heavy intervention by the bank on the local interbank market. It bought nearly two billion U.S. Dlrs between March 5 and 23, he said.     Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government\'s Council for Economic Planning and Development, tolds the rising reserves were \"a big headache for Taiwan.\"     He said the government expects heavier pressure from the U.S., Where protectionist bills are being proposed against nations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluses with the U.S.     Wang said the government would launch new measures within the next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open the market wider to foreign products, especially those from the U.S.     Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan\'s trade surplus, which rose to 2.73 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier. Nearly 90 pct of the surplus was with the U.S.     Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien agreed with Wang\'s remarks and said efforts to avert U.S. Protectionism were running out of time. \"We must do it quickly or face retaliation from Washington,\" he said.     He said the measures would include removal of trade barriers on insurance and inland services for U.S. Companies.     Chang Chi-cheng said the central bank could not stop buying U.S. Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fear the strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses.     He said the bank is studying revision of the foreign exchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls, but declined to give details.     The Taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985. It opened at 34.38 to the U.S. Dollar today and is expected to rise further to 33 in June and to 32 by end-year, some foreign bankers said.  \n',27
'Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves hit a new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year earlier, the central bank said.     Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase came mainly from the bank\'s purchases of more than one billion U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and March 4.     He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.     Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise, but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.     In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S. Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the U.S. Taiwan\'s 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2 billion, according to official statistics.     Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, tolds the government is planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half of this year.     The reserves could support imports of more than two years for Taiwan, compared with about three months for Japan and the U.S.  \n',27
'State-owned (Taiwan Power co) will boost its domestic borrowings to further cut its foreign debt in line with a government policy to trim the island\'s huge foreign exchange reserves, a company official said.     The company\'s foreign debt, mainly from the Japanese and U.S. Banks, was cut nearly by half to 66.2 billion taiwan dlrs equivalent in calendar 1986 from 124.6 billion in 1985, he said.     Its domestic borrowings however rose to 105.2 billion taiwan dlrs from 80.6 billion in the same period, he added.     Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves now stood at 50 billion U.S. Dlrs, due to its 1986 record trade surplus of 15.6 billion.  \n',27
'Taiwan\'s central bank is considering proposals to ease currency restrictions to reduce foreign exchange reserves of 51 billion U.S. Dlrs, a local newspaper reported today.     The China Times, which has close ties with the government, quoted central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng as saying the government had agreed in principle to liberalise financial restrictions.     The bank was considering proposals to allow firms and individuals to hold foreign exchange and invest in foreign stocks for the first time, Chang was quoted as saying.     All foreign exchange must now be handed to local banks and exchanged for local currency. Firms and individuals may only invest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit.     Central bank and other government officials were not available to comment on the report.     Economists said it was likely that the government would ease foreign exchange controls, but only gradually.     They said vast foreign currency reserves, earned mainly from huge trade surpluses with the United States, made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.     Taiwan\'s trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year compared with 10.2 billion in 1985.     \"The central bank has to go in this direction,\" said Su Han-min, chief economist with the International Commercial Bank of China. \"If they don\'t quicken the pace, Washington could retaliate and really damage Taiwan.\"  \n',27

'Jordan\'s key economic priorities are having a sound national treasury and adequate foreign exchange reserves, Prime Minister Zeid al-Rifa\'i said.     \"First, the national treasury should be in sound shape when dealing with the public and other countries so that its credibility is preserved,\" he said in a television interview Saturday.     \"The second priority is to maintain an acceptable level of foreign exchange reserves to provide (the) stability and confidence needed by the government to meet foreign commitments.\"     Rifa\'i said Jordan\'s outstanding government-guaranteed and commercial loans total 902 mln dinars with a debt service ratio of 14.9 pct.     The figure was sharply lower than the 1.02 billion dinars in outstanding loans at the end of September, according to latest Central Bank figures.     Rifa\'i dismissed the view of some bankers and economists here that the dinar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies, is overvalued.     \"The dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserve its stability,\" he said.     The prime minister said he hoped the next Arab summit would tackle the question of continuing financial aid to Jordan. Under a 10-year agreement reached in 1978, Jordan was to receive a total of 1.25 billion dlrs annually from Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help it resist Israel.     But only Saudi Arabia met its obligations, while the others failed because of falling income due to lower oil prices.  \n',27
'Britain\'s gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 1.785 billion dlrs in March after a 287 mln dlr rise in January, the Treasury said.     This was considerably above market expectations for a 650 mln dlr rise.     The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of borrowings and repayments.     The Treasury declined comment on the figures. Last month it said the Bank of England took the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn.     Actual reserves rose by 1.89 billion dlrs, after rising 305 mln in February, to 22.26 billion. Total reserves were revalued to 27.04 billion dlrs, but would have totalled 24.15 billion under the previous valuation, the Treasury said. Gold reserves were revalued by 895 mln dlrs, while SDRs, ECU and convertible currency holdings were revalued by 1.995 billion.     Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 361 mln dlrs last month, after 36 mln in February. Repayments were 240 mln dlrs after the previous 16 mln. Capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, after February\'s two mln dlrs repayment.  \n',27
'Britain\'s gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a 72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.     The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of borrowings and repayments.     This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.     The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.     Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26 billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.     Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a Treasury spokesman said.     Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January, capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund swap.     The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England\'s market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound today.     A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures, said that the government does not want sterling either to rise too far or to fall substantially from current levels.     He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting.     \n',27

'U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said he and a group of Republican lawmakers are considering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol tax exemption through the year 2000.     Dole, addressing the National Corn Growers Association board, said the proposal was under consideration by a rural task force of Republican members of Congress and governors.     Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives a six cents per gallon exemption from a nine cent federal excise tax. The exemption is to expire the end of 1992.     Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusiness firms including Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and A.E. Staley. The tax exemption has helped bolster ethanol production despite a sharp drop in the prices of competing crude oil.  \n',28
'The European Community (EC) agreed tough new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and buses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vast stretches of the region\'s forests.     Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few years the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the main source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.     The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and for all new vehicles from October 1990.     The EC\'s executive Commission says the emission level of nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year from three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if all heavy vehicles applied to the new standards.     There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use in the EC, according to Commission figures.     The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn requested permission to do so to encourage the use of low-pollution cars, diplomats said.     West Germany will still need ministers\' final approval for such a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when EC environment ministers meet next on May 21.     But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germany did not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wide ban on the sale of regular leaded petrol.     Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomats said. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20 mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no damage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol.     Under EC law, ministers have to give member states special permission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition laws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implement a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol.  \n',28

'The EC Executive Commission has backed a plan to allow member countries to ban regular leaded gasoline in a move designed to encourage use of unleaded fuel.     It said in a statement it backed a proposal to allow EC states to ban sales of regular grade gasoline containing lead at six months notice. The proposal, which needs approval by EC ministers, would not force any member state to impose the ban. \"It\'s an option, not an obligation,\" a spokesman said.

'The Federal Trade Commission said its staff has urged the governor of Georgia to veto a bill that would prohibit petroleum refiners from owning and operating retail gasoline stations.     The proposed legislation is aimed at preventing large oil refiners and marketers from using predatory or monopolistic practices against franchised dealers.     But the FTC said fears of refiner-owned stations as part of a scheme of predatory or monopolistic practices are unfounded. It called the bill anticompetitive and warned that it would force higher gasoline prices for Georgia motorists.  \n',28
'A new grade of unleaded gasoline now being test marketed will increase refining costs when refiners can least afford it, according to officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners Association conference here.     The new grade of unleaded gasoline has an octane level of 89 compared with over 90 for super unleaded and 87 for regular unleaded gasoline.      Amoco Corp AN has test-marketed the new mid-grade gasoline and hopes to sell it on a regular basis in the South, East and Midwest by the beginning of June, according to Paul Collier, executive vice president of marketing.     Phillips Petroleum P expects to begin marketing the new 89 octane unleaded gasoline in May, sources said.     Converting current refinery operations to produce the 89 octane unleaded gsoline could cost hundreds of millions of dollars per refinery but that depends on the present capacity and intensity of the refinery, said Amoco\'s Collier.     But not all oil company\'s welcome the introduction of another grade of unleaded gasoline.     \"Three grades are not warranted,\" said Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum CNP. \"Refiners will have to upgrade again,\" he added.     \"An investment will have to be made,\" said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, an operating subsidiary of DuPont Corp DD in order to upgrade refinery operations.  \n',28

'Energy Secretary John Herrington said he would rule out a tax on gasoline as one option to help avert what his departmet has called the threat of increased reliance on foreign oil in the coming years.     He said at a news conference that any recommendation he would make would have to increase domestic production, not cause widespread economic hardship and have a minimal cost to the U.S. taxpayer.     On the grounds of increasing production, he said, \"I would rule out a gasoline tax.\"     Herrington also repeated he would rule out an oil import fee because of the widespread dislocation it would cause -- the loss of about 400,000 jobs nationwide due to higher oil prices and a drop in the gross national product by about 32 billion dlrs.     He said an increased depletion allowance, to 27.5 pct, on new and enhanced production of oil and natural gas would be a cheap way to spur domestic production.     He estimated this cost at about 200 mln dlrs a year.     Herrington proposed the increased depletion allowance to the White House Tuesday but the White House reaction was cool.     The White House said it would study the proposal, but was generally oppposed to altering the national tax code, just passed last year.

'Abu Dhabi\'s offshore Abu al-Bukhoosh oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last November, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry sources said.     They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (Total) TPN.PA, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.     Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi, last November 25.     The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production platform.     Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq.     Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.     The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations, the sources said.     Facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources said.     Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15 mln bpd production, the sources said.     They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field, part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located only a few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air raid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked.  \n',28

DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry on how to stimulate energy production but there is consensus on removing several government policies that hinder investments in new prospects.     DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished immediately and current proposals for increased environmental regulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not adopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil companies, DiBona said.     \"This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil,\" DiBona said. Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen while consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported oil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said.      \n',28

API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with a drop in natural gas liquids production, which was off 11 pct from February 1986 levels, represented a decline in U.S. production of more than one mln barrels a day.     API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day in February, a 30.3 pct increase from last year\'s level.     So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, which was up 2.9 pct from last year\'s year-to-date level, has slowed in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of 1986.

'Argentine crude oil production was down 10.8 pct in January 1987 to 12.32 mln barrels, from 13.81 mln barrels in January 1986, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales said.     January 1987 natural gas output totalled 1.15 billion cubic metrers, 3.6 pct higher than 1.11 billion cubic metres produced in January 1986, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales added.  \n',28
'Argentina\'s total oil and gas production fell 9.4 pct in February to 2.78 mln cubic metres from January\'s total of 3.11 mln cubic metres, the state oil company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF) reported.     A YPF statement blamed the drop on momentary problems owing to the summer season but gave no further details.     February\'s production figure fell slightly short of YPF\'s target figure of 2.90 mln cubic metres.     Oil production totalled 1.76 mln cubic metres last month and natural gas production 1.02 mln cubic metres, down from 1.95 and 1.15 mln cubic metres in January, respectively.  \n',28
'Continuous rebel raids against oil pipelines and foreign exploration camps endanger Colombia\'s present oil bonanza, Franciso Chona, manager of the state-run oil company Ecopetrol said.     \"It seems the subversion wants to end with our oil bonanza,\" he told reporters.     He was speaking after a meeting with Defense Minister Rafael Samudio, military chiefs and Mines and Energy Minister Guillermo Perry to review the security situation in the light of a recent upsurge of leftist guerrilla attacks in the oil-rich Arauca region, bordering Venezuela.     Ecopetrol chief of security, Retired General Carlos Narvaez, said security measures would be stricter and that the armed forces were closely collaborating but gave no details.     Samudio said new plans had been designed and hoped they would be effective. Samudio stressed that, despite the most recent attacks, which cost more than four mln dlrs in damage, the overall situation had improved compared with last December when initial measures were taken to combat a wave of attacks.     Repeated bombings of a vital pipeline from the Cano Limon oilfield to the Caribbean then led to a loss of 51,000 barrels of crude.  \n',28
'The government\'s over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting Australia\'s economic performance, Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.     Over one-third of Australia\'s indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.     This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the country\'s economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.     Australia\'s medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat, yet the government\'s response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry, Benbow said.     Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from 546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the Bass Strait fields, he said.     Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.     By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said.     Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.     Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years time, he said.     At present world oil prices and the current value of the Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.     Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980\'s, the addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.     For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five years 1980-84 represent about two years\' consumption, he said.     He called on the government to review its tax policies to restore incentive to exploration.  \n',28
'Australia\'s crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.     He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government\'s economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry\'s concerns.     Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation.     Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years.     These include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on \'old\' Bass Strait oil found before September 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last September, he said.     The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and Australia\'s relatively low exploration levels.     \"While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes, which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas,\" Evans said.     He said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.     As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects.     APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.     Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more than anything on the government\'s desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules.  \n',28
'The council of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australia\'s petroleum taxation structure.     The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government\'s position on taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.     As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum.     APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development, the council said.     It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.     Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.     \"The government\'s unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based,\" the APEA council said.     The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry\'s concerns, despite its recognition of the industry\'s problems, the council said.     The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices.  \n',28
'A 10 percentage point reduction in the Australian government\'s maximum crude oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output, resources analyst Ian Story said here.     A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000 BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference.     Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.     Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.     The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd BRKN.S/Exxon Corp XON partnership to shut-in production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue, he said.     He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct.     \"The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs,\" Story said.     Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development, he said.     The government is currently reviewing the oil tax structure.  \n',28
'Strong winds and high seas today closed Alexandria, Egypt\'s biggest port, and an oil pipeline terminal nearby, officials said.

Officials said that five other tankers were waiting outside the terminal for conditions to improve.  \n',28
'The Emirates Industrial Bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues.     A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986.     The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).     The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December\'s OPEC accord to restrain overall group production.     These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.     \"All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,\" the study said.     It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.     The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.     It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states\' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985.     The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it added.  \n',28

'The entire British Petroleum Co PLC refinery at Grangemouth in Scotland has been shut down following the explosion and fire that severely damaged the hydrocracker at the site, a refinery spokesman said.     He said the rest of the 178,500 bpd refinery, including the 19,000 bpd catalytic cracker, was undamaged. The whole refinery was closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen the main units will be taken in the next couple of days, he said.     But there was extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products to gasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months.     The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a result of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product from other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam, a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpd plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant.     He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation.     The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of its capacity since the end of January while an extensive overhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where the hydrocracker is sited, he said.     This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, but this is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident.     Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flare line at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13, but the spokesman said this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident.  \n',28
'The British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L said it had no plans to close its refinery in Gothenburg, despite forecasts by a Swedish finance ministry committee that it might be planning such a move.     The committee said the refinery\'s future looked bleak because the Swedish petroleum industry\'s competitiveness was expected to worsen unless it invested, and because of the effects of a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content.     But BP said the unit, in which Sweden\'s OK Petroleum AB has a 22 pct stake, had performed well both technically and financially up to and including the first quarter of 1987.     Current restrictions on sulphur emissions and known future plans for both Sweden and export markets did not cause it any serious problems, it said in a statement.     The refinery started up in 1967 and has an annual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes.  \n',28
'The British Petroleum BP.L Co Plc\'s refinery at Grangemouth, Scotland, shut down after an explosion and fire in the hydrocracker on March 22, will probably be back in operation towards the week-end, a refinery spokesman said.     He said the refinery will resume at about half its 178,500 barrels per day (bpd) capacity, as work on overhauling the North Side of the complex, which began at the end of January, will not be completed before the end of April.     He said the refinery had been closed for longer than originally expected due to the lengthy safety checks being carried out prior to restarting.     The explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, caused extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 hydrocracker and the spokesman said today this unit would be out of operation for several months. The remainder of the refinery, including the 19,000 catalytic cracker, was undamaged.     He said inquiries into the accident, which happened while the hydrocracker was not in operation, were continuing.     In an earlier incident, two people were killed in an explosion and fire at the refinery on March 13.  \n',28
'The British Petroleum Co PLC (BP.L) oil refinery at Grangemouth, closed after an explosion and fire eight days ago, is expected to partially reopen next week, a refinery spokesman said.

The main units will resume operation next week but the hydrocracker will be closed for an unspecified period. The spokesman said the refinery had been operating at about half its capacity since end-January due to overhaul work on part of the complex. The overhaul is expected to end by late April.  \n',28
'Brazil\'s state-oil company, Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said.     Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil\'s decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month.     The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil consumption in Brazil.     But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment.     Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil\'s terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere.     \"Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia\'s traditional client since 1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much better for us, because with the market prices more or less the same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,\" he said.     Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing from Brazil, he said.     Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras oil stocks are \"reasonably balanced.\"      Saudi Arabia is Brazil\'s second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.     \"If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere,\" Santana added.  \n',28
'The Brazilian state oil company Petrobras has made a second oil discovery in the Amazon region, President Jose Sarney said.     He said the well had an initial flow of 150,000 cubic meters of gas and 220 barrels of oil per day. It is situated 14 kilometres from the first well to be discovered in the region last year, which is currently yielding 500,000 cubic meters of gas and 900 barrels of oil daily.     The wells, the biggest onshore well in the country, are on the banks of the river Uruc in the Amazon basin 3,600 kilometres (2,250 miles) north of Brasilia.  \n',28
'Brazilian crude oil and liquefied natural gas production fell to an average 583,747 barrels per day in February from 596,740 in the same 1986 month, the state oil company Petrobras said.     The drop was due to operating problems in the Campos Basin, the country\'s main producing area, where output was down to 346,011 bpd from 357,420, a Petrobras statement said.     Consumption of oil derivatives totalled 1.14 mln bpd in February, 16.7 pct up on February last year but down from the record 1.22 mln bpd used in October last year. Use of alcohol fuel in February was 208,600 bpd, 42 pct above February, 1986.  \n',28
'Brazil will import 30,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Kuwait, a spokesman for the state oil company Petrobras said.

Last month, Petrobras cancelled a 40-mln dlr oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the official Bank of Brazil.     The Saudis eventually lifted the condition and Brazil decided to reconfirm the purchase.     Brazil currently consumes 1.1 mln barrels of oil per day.  \n',28
'With troops in place in Brazil\'s ports and oil installations, the government of Prersident Jose Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of force.     Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and six areas of oil production.     The state-oil company Petrobras requested the intervention because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry employees.     The government had already dispatched more than 1,000 marines to occupy the country\'s main ports after a national seamen\'s strike was ruled illegal last Friday.     The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day, represents a stern challenge to the government.     The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil desperately needs foreign exchange.     It was a deterioration in the country\'s trade balance which precipitated Brazil\'s current debt crisis and the decision on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt.     There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen\'s strike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the most important in South America -- and the country\'s other main ports.     Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on the quays near the strike-bound ships, but the military presence here is generally discreet.     A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are out of sight.     Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, the Docemarte, seamen\'s leaders said. After explaining to the captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because the strike was illegal, the men returned to work.     One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said \"it is a psychological war. They are using force and we are using peaceful methods.\"     Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, the Docemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working.     At the seamen\'s national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are strike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports.     Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, seamen in Santos said the strikers on board ships here were not running out of food.     The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney\'s civilian government since it came to power two years ago.     Yesterday, in a separate protest, hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank interest rates.     The current rash of labour unrest in industry and agriculture stems from the failure of the government\'s now-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze.  \n',28
'Brazilian bank workers voted to launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labour unrest arising from the failure of the government\'s anti-inflation plan.     At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of Sao Paulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24 unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met.     Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees\' 152 unions representing 700,000 workers, tolds the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks.     The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the state-owned petroleum company Petrobras.     The government ordered thousands of troops into the refineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation, but the troops were removed yesterday.     Petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal because the refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated their willingess to negotiate next Wednesday. The government has also sent marines into the main ports.     A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio de Janeiro said unions were studying an offer by private shipowners for a 120 pct pay rise.     Seamen employed by two small companies have already accepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work, as have about 5,000 seamen employed by Petrobras.     Last week also saw widespread protests by hundreds of thousands of farmers over what they see as unfairly high interest rates charged by banks.     According to official estimates, prices rose by more than 33 pct in the first two months of this year.  \n',28
'A strike by Brazil\'s 40,000 seafarers who want pay rises of up to 180 pct may have cost the state-owned oil company Petrobras 20 mln dlrs in lost export orders, the company\'s commercial director Arthur de Carvalho was quoted as saying in press reports.     More than 170 ships in Brazil, and about nine more in foreign ports, have been halted by the strike, which began on February 27.     Marines began blockading the ships on Friday after the strike was ruled illegal, and some strikers are running short of food, National Merchants Marine Union president Edson Areias said.  \n',28
'Brazil\'s labour troubles eased a little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing troops from the country\'s main oil installations occupied three days ago.     The troops went in at the request of the state-oil company Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil industry employees.     Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their willingness to negotiate a pay deal.     A national seamen\'s strike, however, continued and marines remained in the country\'s main ports. The marines were despatched to the ports after the seamen\'s strike, now two weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday.     A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135 in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports.     Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase.     Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a sign that the national strike could soon come to an end.     Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union leaders said the vast majority of Brazil\'s 40,000 seamen were still on strike.     The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de Janeiro next Wednesday.     Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator.     Besides industrial troubles, there has also been considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector.     On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies throughout the country to protest against high interest rates.     Television reports showed some of these protests still continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana.     The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a deterioration in its trade balance.     On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to private banks.     Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange.  \n',28
'Britoil Plc\'s BTOL.L exploration expenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a third of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure would remain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walker said.     He told reporters following the release of the company\'s 1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986 levels.     U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from 184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from 156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in 1985.     Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to 134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary charge of 50 mln stg on the company\'s U.S. Assets. The results were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share firmed to 231p from 222p at last night\'s close. Chairman Sir Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986 had made the period extremely difficult but the company had come through remarkably well.     Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the conditions would be right for a substantially improved performance this year.     He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when they were normally weaker, made him \"a bit encouraged\" about the prospects for future levels.     Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.     Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the latter part of April.     End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared with 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this included a revised definition of reserves.     If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels previously.     Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a restated 3,660 billion. \n',28

'Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada\'s oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said.     They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year\'s dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct.     On Canada\'s stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs.     \"This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive,\" Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said.     Financial statements from Canada\'s major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd\'s 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year\'s results, analysts said.     \"But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future,\" Gobert commented.     The Toronto Stock Exchange\'s oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986.     Among Canada\'s largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd IMO.A, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp XON, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.     Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc TXC, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc TX, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.     Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada\'s largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. \"However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher,\" analyst Plexman said.     \"Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,\" he added.     Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs.     But one industry source doesn\'t think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed.     Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn\'t believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices.     However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts.     Shell Canada and Norcen Energy Resources Ltd forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.     \"The industry\'s outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust,\" Texaco Canada said in its annual report.     \"While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely,\" Texaco Canada added.     In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year\'s lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work.     \"The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,\" Canadian Petroleum Association\'s Maciej said.     Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.     The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.     Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.     The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said.     \"For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more,\" Maciej said.    \n',28
'Canada\'s federal government will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a company\'s oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy Minister Marcel Masse announced.     The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.     The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on or after April 1, 1987.     Masse told reporters that the government\'s oil industry aid package is aimed at small and medium sized companies.     The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.     Masse said the program will probably generate new employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.     He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil prices fell during the first half of 1986.     Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately benefit from tax benefits, he said.     The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson is now reviewing Canada\'s tax system and plans to announce tax reform proposals later this spring.     An important feature of the aid program is a decision to let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to only participating companies, he said.     Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and development, Masse said.     He told reporters his department is still considering whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for the subsidy.  \n',28

'China has closed the second round of bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights, the China Daily has reported.     It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15 foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km.     Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day. The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies.     The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round.     China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37 companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were terminated after no oil was discovered.     Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore China since 1979.  \n',28
'A Swedish Finance Ministry committee forecast that British Petroleum Plc BP.L may have to close its refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening of the Swedish petroleum industry\'s competitiveness.     It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refining business was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oil consumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content and competition from Norway\'s Mongstad facility of Den Norske Stats Olieselskab (Statoil) STAT.OL when its expansion is completed in the 1990s.     The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks a de-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unless costly investments were made to enhance the facility\'s capacity to refine a broader range of products.     But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had in recent years been above that of the European refining industry on average. The BP plant, in which Sweden\'s state-owned OK Petroleum AB has a 22 pct, started up in 1967 and has an annual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes.     There was nobody at British Petroleum immediately available for comment. \n',28
'State-run oil company Ecopetrol said Colombia\'s main oil pipeline was bombed again and pumping of 170,000 barrels per day was suspended.     A spokeswoman for the company said that the early morning dynamite attack was the 31st in the last nine months on the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, which links Colombia\'s biggest oilfied at Cravo Norte to the Caribbean.     She said about 2,000 barrels of crude were spilled and could not indicate when pumping would resume. The attack was near Magangue in northeastern Bolivar province.     Ecopetrol is exploiting Cravo Norte in association with Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY and Shell Petroleum N.V., a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group RD ST.

Exports in january totalled 123,000 bpd.     The quake, which in Colombia measured between 6.5 and seven on the 12-point international Mercalli scale, caused panic among residents but no injuries were reported.  \n',28
'Renewed confidence in OPEC\'s ability to limit production helped U.S. energy futures settle above yesterday\'s closing prices, according to analysts.     They also said the heating oil contract found additional support from a short-covering rally on the close.     April crude closed 24 cts higher to 17.75 dlrs. April heating oil was 1.47 cts higher to 47.91 cts a gallon.     \"Most traders expected follow through profit-taking from yesterday but the market found suport from bullish reports that OPEC is producing within its quota,\" said Simon Greenshields, a vice president with Morgan Stanley and Co Inc.     News today, including OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman statement that OPEC February production did not exceed its official quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day, helped bouy prices, traders said. A survey found OPEC production in early March was 14.7 mln bpd.     In addition to short-covering, heating oil found support from traders buying it against sales of gasoline and crude, as well as from expectations for continued drawdowns in stocks as refiners shut down for maintenance, traders said.     Unleaded gasoline for April finished 0.55 cent higher to 51.24 cts a gallon.  \n',28

'Crude oil netback values in complex refineries rose slightly in the U.S. and the Mediterranean  last Friday from the previous week but were lower elsewhere, according to calculations bys Pipeline.

'U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18  dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall.     \"OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers,\" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. \"That could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher,\" he added.     The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to 18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.     The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a barrel.     \"Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its 15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come under question,\" McKinley said.     Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year.     IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes, or about 74 days consumption.     Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking.     Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price.     \"This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),\" the general trading manager of an international oil company tolds in a telephone interview.     For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output, traders said. A survey estimates OPEC output to be 14.7 mln bpd this week.     Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.     \"This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues, the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there,\" McKinley said.     International oil traders said that other short-haul crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available Mideast crudes earlier this week.     If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading managers at several companies tolds.     But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.     Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity Management, said OPEC production was lower \"because of the Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\"      He added, \"The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,\" he added.     There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.     Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of 18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.     Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.     \"There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government deals, which are below official prices and this is probably being resold,\" one international trader said.  \n',28
'Diamond Shamrock Corp said that effective today it had cut its contract prices for crude oil by 1.50 dlrs a barrel.

Diamond is the latest in a line of U.S. oil companies that have cut its contract, or posted, prices over the last two days citing weak oil markets.  \n',28
'The U.S. Congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.     \"The industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,\" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S. Congress on energy issues.     Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.     Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed.     Herrington said, \"I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day (addition) to U.S. production.\" U.S. oil output was off to 8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last year, the American Petroleum Institute said.     Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be unlikey for the near term.     Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that \"even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we\'ve only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for the year.\"     Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.     John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to Congress said \"The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil prices and U.S. government policy.\"     Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time.     \"Lowering the producing industry\'s tax burden would probably be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but would not raise energy costs.\" Lichtblau said.     But the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee.     Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said, \"The members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our nation.\" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil service companies.     The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff uphill battle.     Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.      At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests.     But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise.     Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements \"is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action.\"      But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, \"a 50 pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.     In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.  \n',28
'Energy Secretary John Herrington said he believes the Reagan Administration will review its decision to cut the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because of a department report issued yesterday warning of growing U.S. dependence on oil imports.     \"As part of this study, I think the Administration will take the fill rate under review,\" Herrington said at a House Energy subcommittee hearing.     The Administration has proposed cutting the fill rate from 75,000 barrels of oil per day to 35,000 bpd in fiscal year 1988 to save money.     \"My personal feeling is that is too low. I favor the maximum fill rate (of 100,000 bpd),\" Herrington said.  \n',28
'Energy Secretary John Herrington said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration.     \"These options boost production, while avoiding the huge costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,\" Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. \"It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review.\"     \"The goal of the Administration policies is to increase domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day,\" he said.

'Tonight\'s American Petroleum Institute oil inventory report is expected to show another drawdown in distillate stocks of between two and 7.5 mln barrels for the week ending March 20, oil analysts and traders said.     They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depleted by about one to four mln barrels.     Analysts were divided on the crude stocks. Some saw stocks unchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher. Others said stocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughput volumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher or lower than the week ended March 13, traders said.     The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S. distillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another  draw reflecting historic seasonal trends.     For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocks down 2.9 mln barrels.     Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels said they are looking for fairly high consumption rates as the spring and summer driving season gets underway this year, because retail prices are still low compared to recent years.     U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrels for the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over the outcome for last week because there is uncertainty about whether throughput levels increased or decreased last week.     Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels higher, while others think inventories could be as much as five mln barrels below the previous week.     The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude runs increased and imports fell.     The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the week ended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly up or down for the week ended March 20.     Expectations for product stockdraws are already being reflected in firmer prices, traders said. But if draws are at the higher end of the estimated range, they added, the effect will be bullish. Any stockbuild would be a negative factor, they said.     Crude runs normally increase in March, and any decrease in runs would be friendly to the market, said Peter Beutel of Elders Energy Futures Inc.  \n',28
'OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a survey shows.     The figures were polled bys correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.     They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.     OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.     The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals.     But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran\"s inability to export as much as its quota allows.     Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.     Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.     Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.     Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March.     Qatar\'s February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.     Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar\"s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.     Nigeria\'s early March output was about one mln bpd, down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.     Industry sources say Nigeria\'s customers believe its Bonny grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes from the U.K. North Sea.

'Higher world oil prices, coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia\'s economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits, bankers and diplomats said.     The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector.     Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.     But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long.     Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC\'s newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.     Oil Minister Hisham Nazer tolds output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi Arabia\'s OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.     King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC\'s new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom\'s need to secure a stable source of income for its economy.     Saudi Arabia, still the world\'s largest oil exporter, is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.     Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.     \"Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects,\" a diplomat said.     In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.     But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term.     It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy.     Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to \"tough it out\" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves.     The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out.     Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year.     \"It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy,\" he said.     Reserves were built up during the late 1970\'s and early 1980\'s when Saudi Arabia\'s breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary.     The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom\'s private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.     Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced, markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.     The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.     Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation\'s industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.     Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit.     As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector, one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.  \n',28
'OPEC member Ecuador adopted austerity measures to conserve fuel after oil production was paralyzed by a strong earthquake.     Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced on television the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct. A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinite suspension of crude oil exports, declaring force majeure.     Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a television interviewer that it could possibly take more than a month to repair Ecuador\'s main pipeline linking Amazon basin oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast.     The quake on Thursday, which registered six on the 12-point Mercalli scale, killed at least six people and was centred near the Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito.     Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day.     The government\'s austerity measures ban the sale of aviation fuel to foreign airliners on international routes and no fuel will be available for ships owned by foreign lines.     Ecuador also banned the sale of petrol on weekends and holidays and limited sales on weekdays, an Energy and Mines Ministry communique said.  \n',28
'Construction workers today began building a 26 km (16 mile) pipeline to link Ecuador\'s jungle oilfields to a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude could be pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitry officials said.     They said it would take about two months and at least 15 mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia\'s Pacific Ocean coast.     The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said.     The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about 17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean energy ministry official said.     The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic demand.     The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an  earthquake the night before.     The tremor ruptured the country\'s main pipeline from jungle oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific Ocean.     Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the earthquake. It would take about five months to repair the pipeline to Balao, government officials said.     Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mln dlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake, energy ministry Javier Espinosa said.      \n',28
'Ecuador needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to its oil export pipeline caused by last week\"s earthquake, which will stop crude exports for five months, energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said.     Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc TX.N and a Mexican and an Argentine firm.     President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports for four months due to the quake.     Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of Ecuador\'s total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues.     Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired.     The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a 180-day period.     He added the Caracas-based Andean Development Corp had granted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline, 50 km of which had been damaged in the quake.     In Quito, Foreign Minister Rafael Garcia Velasco yesterday summoned ambassadors from about 40 countries to whom he issued appeal for emergency aid for the country. Only three countries, the U.S., Colombia and Venezuela, had offered assistance.  \n',28
'Ecuador\'s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on further Venezuelan assistance to his country\'s oil industry following last week\'s earthquake, officials said.     Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports.     Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after 180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs.     The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador\'s entire OPEC quota, set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987.     \"All options are open at this moment in the context of cooperation on oil production,\" a Venezuelan energy and mines ministry source said.     Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the pipeline is repaired, officials said.     Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at technical level, officials said.     Industry sources said that among the options are for Venezuela to produce Ecuador\'s entire quota, or for Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply Ecuador\'s Far Eastern clients.     But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made in due course.     Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired.     Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake.  \n',28
'The Andean Development Corp (CAF) said today it is lending 11.7 mln dlrs to Ecuador to help repair 25 miles of oil pipeline destroyed by an earthquake earlier this month.     the loan was signed here today in the offices of the caracas based caf by the corporation\'s president, galo montano perez and ecuadorean ambassador antonio parra gil.     the loan had originally been intended to finance an expansion of the pipeline, but following the earthquake the ecuadorean government asked for the terms to be changed so as to permit their use in reconstruction.     Ecuador expects oil production to be suspended for four months as a result of the damage, and has asked Venezuela to help by supplying 50,000 barrels per day while the pipeline is repaired.     The OPEC member has a production quota of 210,000 bpd but has asked the organization to allow it to produce 310,000 bpd once the repairs are completed so as to compensate the loss.  \n',28
'Earthquake-stricken Ecuador is negotiating with Nigeria to have the African country lend it 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude for export, Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite tolds.

Ecuador has suspended crude exports for about five months until it repairs a pipeline ruputured by a March five tremor.     Santos Alvite added Ecuador is finalizing details for a program under which Venezuela would temporarily lend the country 50,000 bpd for export.  \n',28

'up to 300 people were feared dead and more than 15,000 people left homeless by thursday\'s earthquake, which will cost Ecuador close to 800 mln dlrs in lost petroleum revenues, authorities said.     They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipeline at 150 mln dlrs.     \"the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake is gigantic,\" president leon febres cordero said after inspecting the damages in napo, the hardest-hit jungle province, 100 miles from here.     The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing this opec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, president febres cordero said in a statement issued today by the presidential press office.     The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crude exports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. It would cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carries oil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacific ocean port.     Crude traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of ecuador\'s exports.     the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico river which burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napo province, health minister jorge brancho tolds.     \"we fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there is no way of now knowing the exact figure because many people have disappeared,\" he said.     Other estimates ranged as high as 500 dead.     So far 20 corpses have been recovered, bracho said.     Information Minister Marco Lara told reporters: \"the number of dead and injured is not known ... because we do not know how many people lived in the homes hit by the landslides.\"     Bracho said at least 15,000 were left homeless in the cayambe district.  \n',28
'President Leon Febres Cordero said Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.     Ecuador said on Friday that last week\'s earthquake was forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt.     \"All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour,\" the president said during a visit to the quake zone. \"A government as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain.\"     Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.     He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17 dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.     Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the earthquake, which killed at least 300 people.     Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet, would be reduced.     He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited.  \n',28
'Ecuador today suspended its crude oil exports indefinitely due to an earthquake last night that damaged pumping and crude transport installations, an Energy and Mines MInistry statement said.     It said the state oil firm Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana (CEPE) notified foreign customers that it was declaring force majeure on its crude exports due to the tremor.     Ecuador\"s OPEC oil output quota is 210,000 barrels per day (bpd).     A senior energy ministry official said that one pumping station at El Salado on Ecuador\'s main pipeline was damaged.     He also said an 180 metre section of the pipeline attached to the bridge over the Aguarico river collapsed.     The pumping station was about 20 km from the Reventador volcano, near the epicentre of the quake, which Ecuadorean seismologists said registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The Aguarico bridge was also close to the volcano, he said.     The quake struck northern Ecaudor and southern Colombia, according to Ecuadorean officials. No injuries were reported.  \n',28
'Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to compensate for lost output due to last week\'s earthquake, deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said.     Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.     The additional output would be related to plans now under discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.     Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified part of Ecuador\'s export commitments.     But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of 300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico might supply Ecuador\'s South Korean market.     Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao.  \n',28
'The suspension of Ecuador\'s crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.     The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, tolds. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.     The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues.     Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.     However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build.     Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month\'s imports.     It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country\'s total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America.     In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.     Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said.     A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.  \n',28

'Energy analyst Edward Krapels said the United States should consider an oil tariff to keep U.S. dependence on imports below 50 pct.     \"On the supply side, the argument in favor of a contingent, variable import tariff is most persuasive,\" Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis, Inc said in a statement at a House Energy and Power subcommittee hearing.     \"An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the international price of crude oil falls below, say, 15 dlrs a barrel. On the demand side, the obvious policy is an excise tax on transportation fuels,\" Krapels said.     But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with the oil tariff proposal, saying Congress should remove price controls on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax incentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserve exisiting tax incentives for drilling.

Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, tolds after addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, \"By early in the next century, synthetics should play a significant role in this country\'s energy supply.\"     McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range.     \"You\'re talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil prices, but I think that time is coming and we\'ve got to be prepared,\" McMillan said.     He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct annually in the next few years while the nation fails to replace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn of the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher because of declining supplies, McMillan said.     Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help spur development of synthetic fuels.     The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that of all the world\'s known oil reserves.     \"We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels competitive later,\" Hall said. The average lead time for development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between five and ten years.     Until last year, the federal government had subsidized synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a research program created during the Carter Administration with the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels of oil.     The corporation was shut down last April when Congress refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.  \n',28
'World governments should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the price of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp XON director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said.     Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference.     It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact, he said.     McIvor said 37 of the world\'s 30,000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.     Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.     He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.     More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the Middle East, he said.     McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability.     \"It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of acreage for exploration,\" he said.     Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum, he added.  \n',28
'White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan\'s record in opposing tax hikes is \"long and strong\" and not about to change.     \"We\'re opposed to tax increases.... We will fight tax increases.... We will deal with it politically in every forum possible,\" said Fitzwater when questioned about whether there was any change in the administration\'s position.     Fitzwater said Reagan\'s strong feelings against a tax hike included opposition to an oil import fee.     \"The President\'s position is that he is opposed to it,\" he said.  \n',28
'Greece, replying to a warning from Turkey that it will stop Athens from seeking oil in the Aegean Sea, repeated today that it has an exclusive right to decide where or when to drill in the area.     A government spokesman said in a statement that if Ankara believed Greece was contravening international law, it could bring the issue before the courts.     The spokesman was responding to a statement by Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp that Ankara would take action to stop Greece\'s oil activities beyond its territorial waters as they were a violation of the 1976 Berne accord.  \n',28
'Greece, responding to a warning by Turkey against conducting oil activities in the Aegean Sea, said today it had the right to decide where and how to do research or drilling work in the area.     A government spokesman said the Greek position was made clear to Turkey\'s ambassador Nazmi Akiman when he met Greek Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Yannis Kapsis last week.     Acting Turkish Prime Minister Kaya Erdem said earlier today Greek activities in the northern Aegean contravened the 1976 Berne Agreement which set the framework for talks on the Aegean continental shelf disputed between Ankara and Athens.     The Greek statement today said, \"Greece is not prepared to give up even a trace of its sovereignty rights to the seabed. It has been stressed to...Mr Akiman that the decision where or how to drill belongs exclusively to the Greek government.\"     \"The Greek government has repeatedly let the Turkish side know that it considers the 1976 Berne protocol as inactive through the fault of Turkey,\" it said.     The Greek statement said Athens was ready to put the continental shelf issue before international courts.  \n',28
'Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has withdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil rights in the Aegean eased.     A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential clash.     Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.     The Greek government later withdrew Friday\'s request to Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea Makri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which had prompted it to make the request were no longer valid.     Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its national interests are threatened.     The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.     Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled. Athens says it considers the accord inactive.     The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined comment on the statement.     Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague.     Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said he had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General Secretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row.  \n',28
'Deputy oil ministers from six Gulf Arab states will meet in Bahrain today to discuss coordination of crude oil marketing, the official Emirates news agency WAM reported.     WAM said the officials would be discussing implementation of last Sunday\'s agreement in Doha by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) oil ministers to help each other market their crude oil.     Four of the GCC states - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait and Qatar - are members of the Organiaation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some face stiff buyer resistance to official OPEC prices.  \n',28
'No action has been taken yet on the Reagan Adminstration\'s offer to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers through the Gulf, but the issue is being discussed, U.S. Secretary of Defence Caspar Weinberger said.     The offer was made to Kuwait in light of Iran\'s deployment of Chinese-built missiles to cover the entrance to the Gulf.     Weinberger told reporters prior to a speech at Texas Christian University that he did not think Iran and the United States were moving towards a potential conflict, adding that the Straits of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf were still \"free water.\"  \n',28
'Energy Secretary John Herrington said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.     He said also at a news conference that he would recommend to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels per day.     The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a day.     Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints.     Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce.     He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the Energy Department\'s study on oil\'s impact on national security.     Herrington said that before he disclosed what recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase oil production made good tax policy.     He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one mln barrels a day.     The report said that by the end of the century the United States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil consumption, posing a serious economic and national security threat.  \n',28
'House Speaker Jim Wright endorsed a proposal to require the president to take action to reduce oil imports if they threaten to top 50 pct of U.S. consumption.     Wright told reporters the plan by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a fellow Texas Democrat, was positive and useful. Oil imports peaked in 1977 at 47 pct, were short of 36 pct last year and this year are up over 40 pct, Bentsen said.      The Bentsen proposal, supported by 24 other Senators, would would require the president to issue annual three-year oil import forecasts. In any year they threatened to top 50 pct, he would be ordered to propose quotas or other solution.      \n',28
'U.S. drilling activity rose last week with the number of working rotary rigs up by 23 to 784, against 1,063 working rigs one year ago, Hughes Tool Co. said.     The improvement was the first increase this year in the weekly rig count, which had dropped steadily since early January when a total of 962 rotary rigs were working.     Among individual states, Texas and Oklahoma reported the biggest gains in drilling last week with increases of 21 and 11, respectively. California and Louisiana were each up by three and Wyoming gained two additional working rigs.     Hughes Tool said it counted a total of 692 rigs drilling on land, 74 rigs active offshore and 18 drilling in inland waters. In Canada, the rig count was up by two to 183, against 324 one year ago.  \n',28

'Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency said.     Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by around one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day, the IEA said in its latest monthly report.     Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year\'s 3.6 pct.     The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.     If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.     IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same as at the begining of the year.     The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks.     Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender 1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.     The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.     Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.     Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption.     The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in March.     And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said.     As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.     World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.     This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally Planned Economies, the IEA said.     Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.     A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.  \n',28
'OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter 1986, the International Energy Agency said.     A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest monthly oil market report.     These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to fixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for fixed volumes over an extended period.

Contracts for Saudi crude have been signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required liftings.     The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on Iranian export facilities allowed Iran\'s output to reach 2.2 mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices apparently cut February production.     It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and 0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd.     The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and 47.0 mln in the fourth quarter.     The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids (ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other developing countries\' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal) and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains.     Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record 1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected in February in accordance with government curtailments of approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC.  \n',28
'Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.

World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.     This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.     Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.     A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.

'Indonesia has minimised the economic impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said.     Indonesia was badly hit by last year\'s steep plunge in crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half.     But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the previous year.     Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said, although he did not give complete figures.     The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber, palm oil, tin, timber and coffee.     Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against the dollar, which increased Indonesia\'s debt repayments.     He said the economy would have suffered more from the world economic recession if the government had not devalued the rupiah by 31 pct last September.     In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post said the government must press ahead with measures to deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports.     The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were needed to finance not only imports but also the country\'s growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs.     \"About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due within the next three to five years and will steadily increase the debt servicing burden,\" the paper said.     However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in expectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealers said.     Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar\'s nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate rebound to halt further dollar depreciation.     A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this afternoon were taken favourably by the market.  \n',28
'Negotiations between Indonesia\'s state oil company Pertamina and foreign oil contractors on extension of the standard 30-year production sharing contract will be concluded by the end of this month, a Pertamina official said.     Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertamina\'s foreign contractors coordinating board, gave no details about the outcome of the talks.     But Pertamina President Abdul Rachman Ramly has said priority will be given to extending contracts for companies whose exploration and production contracts expire within the next seven to 10 years.     Jukardi, speaking to Indonesian reporters, said the negotiations would determine whether the 85-15 production sharing split in favour of Pertamina would be adhered to or altered in some cases as oil companies are asking for.     Hardjoko Seputro, spokesman for the Mines and Energy Ministry, has said that President Suharto has agreed in principle to extension of the standard 30-year production sharing contract to reflect better current depressed conditions on the international oil market.  \n',28
'Indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.     To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year\"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September.     But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto\"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy.     \"(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,\" the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia\"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country\"s general economic performance.     It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, \"there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.\"     \"This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,\" the report says.     Indonesia\"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.     Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports.     The report says Indonesia\"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. \"This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s,\" the report notes.     Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April.     But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. \"For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.\"     \"Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture,\" the report states.     Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs.     A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.  \n',28
'Iran said reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned the U.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region.     Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by \"a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world.\"      U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.     The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.     U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship \"Silkworm\" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before.     The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were \"misleading propaganda.\"     He said Iraq\'s President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use \"all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension.\"     Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. \"We are fully prepared to do what\'s necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway.\"     \"We aren\'t going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area,\" he said.     Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual.     A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea.     The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the region.  \n',28
'Japanese customers have bought nearly six mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese traders involved in the transactions tolds.     NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese customers with different formulas. One company has bought 800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of 30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.     Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.      Iran\'s discounted sales have not, however, managed to reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot markets, oil traders said.     Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC\'s February output was below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.     Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market are supporting spot price levels, they said.      Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a discount, the sources said. \"It\'s just disguised cheating,\" one Japanese trader said.     The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the official price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of the price related to processing arrangements.  \n',28
'Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh arrived in Algiers at the head of a large delegation for talks on stabilizing oil prices, the official news agency APS said.     In a brief arrival statement, he said Iran and Algeria were engaged in \"continuous and stronger cooperation\" on the world petroleum market and had \"deployed considerable efforts to stablise petroleum prices.\"     He was greeted on arrival by Belkacem Nabi, the Algerian Minister of Energy, Chemical and Petro-Chemical Industries.  \n',28

He will meet UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan and Oil Minister Mana Said al-Oteiba.     Aqazadeh arrived last night after a brief stopover in Riyadh, where he met Saudi Arabia\'s Oil Minister Hisham Nazir.     The official Saudi Press Agency quoted him as saying his talks at Riyadh with Nazir had been constructive and good.     Aqazadeh said Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members were agreed on holding production stable and he reiterated the importance of maintaining oil prices.     OPEC members agreed in December to limit production to 15.8 mln barrels per day for the first half of this year and on a benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.     Aqazadeh also visted OPEC members Gabon, Algeria and Libya. The Iranian news agency, IRNA, quoted him as saying before leaving Tripoli that OPEC should do everything possible to make oil prices permanently stable.  \n',28
'Iraqi President Saddam Hussein carried out his first major government shakeup in five years tonight, naming a new oil minister in shuffling three posts.     One minister was dropped in the shuffle, announced in a presidential decree. It gave no reason for the changes in the government of the Arab Baath Socialist Party which has ruled Iraq since a revolution in 1968.     The decree named the head of the Iraqi National Oil Company (INOC), Isam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalaby, to take over as oil minister replacing Qassem Ahmed Taqi.     Taqi, appointed oil minister in the last significant government reorganization in 1982, was moved to be minister of heavy industries.  \n',28
'Iraq said today its warplnes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends.     The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.     It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran\'s failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday.     A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran\'s Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time.     The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January.     The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it.     In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack.     But there has been no independent confirmation of today\'s supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours.     The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg.     Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran\'s offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today\'s communique said.     The three oilfields have been raided several times in the past three years. Oil sources said they were not crucially important to Iran\'s oil export trade.     A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war front.     It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and several Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil terminal at the northen tip of the Gulf.     Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with their occupants and the others fled, it said.  \n',28
'Iraq said its warplanes launched two bombing raids on Iran\'s offshore Nowruz oilfield in the northern Gulf today.     A military spokesman, quoted by the official Iraqi news agency, said platforms at the field were reduced \"to rubble.\"     He said attacks on the field, 55 miles northwest of Iran\'s Kharg Island oil terminal, were carried out at 0600 GMT. He said today\'s raids \"fall within Iraq\'s policy to deprive Iranian rulers of oil revenue used to serve their aggressive aims.\"     Iraqi planes yesterday raided the nearby Ardeshir oil field, resuming attacks on Iranian targets after a month-long lull.  \n',28
'Iraq said its warplanes had hit a vessel in the Gulf off the Iranian coast today, the third in the past 24 hours.     A military spokesman told the Iraqi news agency INA the latest attack was at 1250 GMT. It earlier reported strikes at 0650 GMT and at 1930 GMT last night. The planes \"dealt accurate and effective blows\" to the targets and returned safely to base.     There was no immediate confirmation of the attacks from Gulf shipping sources. The last confirmed Iraqi attack was on on March 8, when an Iranian tanker was hit by a missile south of Iran\'s Kharg island oil export terminal.  \n',28
'Iraq said its forces sank three Iranian boats which tried to approach its disused deep water oil terminal in the northern Gulf today.

'Iraq\'s Oil Minister Qassem Ahmed Taqi has been moved to the Heavy Industries ministry, the official Iraqi news agcny INA said tonight.     It quoted a Presidential decree appointing Oil Ministry undersecretary Isam Abdul-Rahim Al-Chalaby as the new Oil Minister.     The Ministers of Industry and Communication and Transport had both been relieved of their posts, the news agency said.     No immediate explanation was given for the changes.     Al-Chalaby is the head of the Iraqi National Oil Company.     INA said the decree, signed by President Saddam Hussein, relieved the Minister of Heavy Industries, Subhi Yassin Khadeir of his post and appointed him a Presidential adviser.     His ministry was formerly known as the Industry and Mineral Resources Ministry. The Minister of Communications and Transport, Abdel-Jabbar Abdel-Rahim al-Asadi was also relieved of his post and replaced by a member of the ruling Baath party regional command, Mohammed Hamza al-Zubeidi. Al-Zubedei is also a Presidential adviser. All three ministers involved in the reshuffle had spent more than four years in their posts.  \n',28
'Worldwide spot crude oil movements fell to 30.07 mln long dwt in February from 37.25 mln tons in January and 41.44 mln in December, London shipbroker Howard Houlder said.     The decline mainly reflected a sharp drop in movements out of the Mideast Gulf, which totalled 7.4 mln tons last month against 11.65 mln in January. These included shipments to western options at 2.05 mln tons against 3.59 mln previously.     Liftings from the Gulf to eastern options fell to 4.15 mln tons from 5.94 mln and those from the Gulf to other areas dropped to 1.2 mln tons from 2.13 mln, Howard Houlder said.     U.K./Continent coastal movements declined sharply to 2.91 mln tons from 4.77 mln but those from the U.K./Continent to the U.S. rose to 1.99 mln from 1.69 mln.  \n',28

'Kuwait may re-register part of its tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the U.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian missile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were quoted by the New York Times as saying.     The transfers would allow the country of registration to escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf. Kuwait had earlier declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an admission of its need for protection, they said.     Kuwait is also looking at flagging-out to European registries, the officials said.     Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the Gulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said.     Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S. Escorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a naval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as saying.     Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran and its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian attacks.     The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month on methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships.  \n',28
'Kuwait\'s oil minister said in a newspaper interview that there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting after the recent weakness in world oil prices.     Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying that \"none of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.\"     He also denied that Kuwait was pumping above its OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd).     Crude oil prices fell sharply last week as international oil traders and analysts estimated the 13-nation OPEC was pumping up to one million bpd over its self-imposed limits.  \n',28
'Kuwait has asked at least four countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf, Reagan Administration officials said.     The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new \"Silkworm\" missiles at superpower flags.     The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the mouth of the gulf.     \"They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to carry their oil,\" one of the administration officials, who asked not to be identified, tolds.     The United States is considering the request to temporarily transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a move could create insurance and other problems, the officials said.     U.S. defense officials tolds yesterday that Kuwait had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S. offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping.  \n',28
'Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said in a newspaper interview that no OPEC member was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the 13-nation group.     Sheikh Ali told Kuwait\'s daily al-Anba \"All OPEC states, without exception, are producing within the quotas allocated to them. Some of them are producing less.\"     Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab Emirates, which had been generally been producing over its quota since OPEC returned to quotas last September, was still pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of this year.     Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, but an earthquake early this month stopped that. Iraq has rejected its quota, but oil sources say it may be having problems marketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell.     OPEC agreed in December to cut overall oil production by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the first six months of this year and abide by fixed prices around 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.  \n',28
'Kuwait\"s Oil Minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices.     Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying: \"None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.\"     He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation.     Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December.     They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.     \"This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,\" the minister said.     Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.     \"If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,\" he said.     He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel.     Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel.     Sheikh Ali also delivered \"a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.\"     Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.     However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added.     He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC\"s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body\"s members.     Ecuador\"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec\"s pricing committee.     Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: \"We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April.\" But he expected the situation would later improve.  \n',28
'Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said OPEC was producing well below its oil output ceiling and this would help prices move higher, according to a Kuwaiti newspaper interview.     The al-Rai al-Aam newspaper quoted him as saying OPEC was pumping 2.4 mln barrels per day (bpd) less than its 15.8 mln bpd ceiling, while consumers were drawing down their petroleum stocks at a rate of 4.5 mln bpd.     As long as OPEC maintains its output curbs, demand for its oil will rise in April and May, Sheikh Ali said, adding that Kuwait was strongly committed to its OPEC quota.  \n',28
'Five regional oil producing nations will gather in Caracas tommorrow for a two-day meeting expected to center on ways to combat proposals for a U.S. tax on imported petroleum, the Venezuela\'s ministry of energy and mines said.     Oil ministers from Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, Ecuador and Venezuela will be on hand for the fifth meeting of the informal group of Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Exporters, formed in 1983, it said. Colombia will also attend for the first time, as an observer nation, the ministry said.     Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said the conference has no set agenda but one entire session Friday will be devoted to proposals for a tax on imported oil.     Two of the group\'s members, Venezuela and Mexico, are second and third largest foreign suppliers of oil to the United States, respectively, following Canada.     Venezuela, concerned about the effect such a tax would have on its exports, undertook a diplomatic push to coordinate strategy against such measures. In February, Canadian Energy Minister Marcel Masse was invited to Caracas for talks with Hernandez on proposals for an oil import tax.  \n',28
'Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland Revenue said in a post-budget statement.     Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).     To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was not immediately available against other development expenditure, the statement said.     The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.     Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT liability.     This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred, to be allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland Revenue said.     This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs, it said.     In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year, it calculated.     The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.     These included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation.     Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the so-called \"ring fence\" of activities in the U.K. And its continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in November, it said.     Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.     He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.     Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged, he said.     Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.     He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin.     This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.     He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year.  \n',28
'U.S. refiners will have to reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, said industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting here.      \"If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second quarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of petroluem products at Conoco Inc     \"If not, the industry will have a tough 1987,\" he added.      Last week\'s American Petroleum Institute report said that U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity, with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week ended March 20.      The API said that with the higher crude oil runs,  distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2 mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7 mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year\'s level, the API said.      Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp CNP tolds that unless refining and marketing return to profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings.      \"The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it continues,\" said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of refining and marketing at Total Petroleum Co, a U.S. subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France.      Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given the current level of demand but the operating level should increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter, Buckler said.      Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S. refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude per day. \"I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries over the next five years,\" he said, adding that these facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The API said U.S. operations have the capacity to refine 15.6 mln bpd of crude.  \n',28
'Madagascar extended its oil exploration agreement with the U.S. Firm Amoco Corp AN for 17 months to allow for further studies of the Morondava basin on the southwest coast, a government statement said.     It said the existing five-year agreement, due to expire this July 24, was extended until the end of 1988 to allow for additional geological and geophysical studies.     Amoco has so far laid 7,100 km of seismic lines and sunk five exploration wells in the Morondava basin. It may drill a further three wells before the end of the extended exploration period, the statement said.     Madagascar has signed oil exploration agreements with four foreign oil companies since 1981. But despite promising indications of large reserves, no commercial production plans have yet been announced.     The foreign firms - Amoco, Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY, Mobil Corp MOB and a unit of Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi - are working in partnership with the National Military Office for Strategic Industries (OMNIS).     Roland Ratsimandresy, the director general of OMNIS, said at a ceremenony to sign the extension of the Amoco agreement that his department would intensify oil exploration with its existing partners and would soon offer a new round of exploration licences.  \n',28
'Malaysia\'s state oil company Petronas will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May 1, trade sources said.     Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986\'s target level.     Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its 10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.     However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report that Malaysia\'s crude oil output was expected to rise to an average 510,000 bpd in 1987.     The ministry\'s forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit further production cutbacks, the sources said.     Malaysia\'s benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said.     Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced Indonesian and Chinese crude output.     The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said.     In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month for sale through tender, the sources said.     However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the reduced scale of production, they said. \n',28

'OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated.     A landslide breached Iraq\'s one mln bpd pipeline through Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.     MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.     MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of its total production into floating storage.     Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer tolds and the television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output, including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd.     The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower than that.     It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a further 25,000 bpd of \"purchase crude.\"     It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only 2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift at official prices.     MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member countries calling for the formation of a committee to study what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among various members.     The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was having difficulty selling crude at official prices.     The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC price regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and \"other forms of hydrocarbons\" which are marketed in package deals with crude oil.  \n',28

Natural gas output in 1986 was 3.43 billion cubic feet per day, down from 3.6 billion in 1985.     Due mainly to the fall in oil prices to around 12 dlrs from 25 dlrs in the year, 58 wells, both exploratory and production, were suspended, 38 of them in less productive areas than the offshore campeche fields which accounted for 64 pct of production.  \n',28
'Mobil Corp MOB.N of the U.S. Plans to open an office in Peking to develop oil exploration opportunities in China, the China Daily said.     It quoted Mobil president Richard Tucker, currently in Peking, as saying he is optimistic about investment prospects in China and that Peking will continue to encourage foreign private businesses to invest here.     It said Mobil bought 73 mln dlrs of crude oil and oil products from China in 1986 and sold it lubricant and fertiliser, but gave no more details.  \n',28

'Selm-Societa Energia Montedison is to close its Priolo crude refining units from March 15th to March 28th for maintenance, a company spokesman said.     Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at 140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd.     Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have been rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude.      Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the  shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said.     Garrone\'s refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) is due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the jointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity 220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th following its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman said.     The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said.     In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de BP\'s Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is 181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pct capacity, a company spokesman said.     Shell Francaise\'s Berre l\'Etang refinery will shut down in early April until mid-June, a company spokesman said. Capacity is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR) will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early April, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, a company spokesman said. Current capacity is 136,000 bbl/day.     Despite current bullish sentiment in the Med, however, traders noted that crude netbacks are beginning to look more attractive, and most maintenance shutdowns should be finished in two to three weeks.     As a result, oil industry sources suggest that the situation may ease by mid-April.  \n',28
'Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC\'s official levels, industry sources said.     They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs.     Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.     The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.     They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices.     \"If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,\" one Japanese refiner said.     \"We don\'t intend to put pressure on them,\" he added.     Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower, oil traders said.     They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices. Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is likely to recur in April, adding to that country\'s surplus.     The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC\'s December production agreement, while agreeing to the fixed prices.     But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter.     They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea\'s Brent blend.     One Japanese refiner said, \"At the moment there\'s a lot of pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out there will be no problem, and I\'m beginning to trust their ability.\"     Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, \"Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.\"     He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude.     A Japanese refiner said, \"The European and U.S. Markets are beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky.\" \n',28
'Greece and Turkey\'s NATO allies today called on both countries to avoid any action that could aggravate an explosive situation in the Aegean and \"avoid recourse to force at all costs.\"     After an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors, a statement was issued saying \"the present situation damages the interests of Greece and Turkey, and of the Alliance as a whole.\"     Secretary-General Lord Carrington also offered himself as a mediator in the dispute on the Western Alliance\'s southern flank.     The meeting was called after reports that warships of both countries were sailing towards a disputed oil exploration zone of the Aegean.     The statement said the tensions in the area had reached a serious level and called on both countries to begin immediate discussions. \"Any intensification would make things worse,\" it added.     No attempt was made at the meeting to resolve the complex dispute which was aimed at damage-limitation. Carrington said, \"I am of course anxious to help in any way I can, provided that both Greece and Turkey, and the other allies, wish me to do so.\"  \n',28
'NATO ambassadors met in emergency session today to discuss tension between members Greece and Turkey over a disputed area of the Aegean Sea on the Western Alliance\'s southern flank, Greek diplomatic sources said.     They said no information had yet emerged from the meeting, called after statements from both countries that they were prepared to back rival oil exploration teams with warships.     General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, said today the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning.     Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said \"The military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions.\"     The row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover.  \n',28
'Higher crude oil prices will raise demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.     The analysts said that these efforts will be most successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large and growing energy requirements.     \"Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual fuel industry last year,\" Michael Smolinski, an energy economist with Data Resources Inc, tolds.     An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said.      Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected 2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive, Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American Gas Association said.     The average delivered prices at the end of January were 2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.     \"We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and third quarter (1987),\" he said.     In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas, Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp. in New York noted.     Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this spring freeing gas for spot sales.     These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last year.     AGA\'s German contended that despite the drilling decline, much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.     Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986 to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not go away until 1990.     Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote.  \n',28
'New England Electric System NES expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs this year, up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986, the utility said in material distributed at an analysts meeting.     It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in 1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989.     The utility said these totals exclude spending on New England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project.     The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission lines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.     New England Electric said internally generated funds will cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and 65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan to spend in 1987.     The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on its oil and gas activities this year, adding internally generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.     New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year as well.     The company said it does not plan to offer common shares this year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.     President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the construction spending projection is based on the expectation that demand for electricity in the New England electric system will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.     However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for sharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2 pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.     He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices and a strong New England economy.     Huntington said New England Elecetric has \"all but rejected new coal fired plants\" to supply additional power.     He said the most attractive new power supplies are those with short lead times which can be built in modules.     Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is looking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply most of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired fluidized bed units.     He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in modular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal.  \n',28
'Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti today told a meeting of regional oil exporters the next few months will be critical to efforts to achieve price recovery and stabilize the market.      Hernandez said while OPEC and non-OPEC nations have already made some strides in their efforts to strengthen the market, the danger of a reversal is always present.     \"March and the next two or three months will be a really critical period,\" Hernandez said. He said, \"We will be able to define a movement, either towards market stability and price recovery or, depending on the market, a reversal.\"     Earlier this week, Hernandez said Venezuela\'s oil price has averaged just above 16 dlrs a barrel for the year to date. If OPEC achieves its stated goal of an 18 dlrs a barrel average price, he said, Venezuela\'s should move up to 16.50 dlrs.     Hernandez spoke today at the opening of the fifth ministerial meeting of the informal group of Latin American and Caribbean oil exporters, formed in 1983.     Ministers from member states Ecuador, Mexico, Trinidad-Tobago and Venezuela are attending the two day conference, while Colombia is present for the first time as an observer.     Hernandez defined the meeting as an informal exchange of ideas about the oil market. However, the members will also discuss ways to combat proposals for a tax on imported oil currently before the U.S. Congress.     Following the opening session, the group of ministers met with President Jaime Lusinchi at Miraflores, the presidential palace. The delegations to the conference are headed by Hernandez of Venezuela, Energy Minister Javier Espinosa of Ecuador, Energy Minister Kelvin Ramnath of Trinidad-Tobago, Jose Luis Alcudiai, assistant energy secretary of Mexico and Energy Minister Guilermno Perry Rubio of Colombia.  \n',28
'ESSO SAF ESSF.PA, the French subsidiary of Exxon Corp XON, said it had no immediate plans to shut down one of its two refineries. Exxon\'s new president Lee R. Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French refinery.     An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that depended on the evolution of the market and refineries\' ability to make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.     The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer\'s is five mln, the spokesman added.     Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.     Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close one of its French refineries.  \n',28
'Norwegian oil companies Norsk Hydro A/S NHY.OL and Saga Petroleum A/S SAGO.OL said they have applied for offshore exploration drilling licenses in Gabon on Africa\'s west coast.     Saga Petroleum said it has applied for a 35 pct share and operatorship on one block, adding Finnish oil company Neste NEOY.HE(25 pct), Spain\'s Hispanoil (25 pct), and the World Bank\'s International Finance Corporation (IFS) (15 pct) have joined Saga to fill remaining shares in the application.     Saga spokesman Roy Halvorsen tolds he expected Gabonese officials would reply to the application by Easter.     Halvorsen said this is the first time Saga has applied to operate on OPEC-member Gabon\'s continental shelf, adding that Italian oil company Agip is heading a group of applicants in a separate bid for the same license.     Norsk Hydro has also applied for an undisclosed share in a single exploration license in which U.S. Oil company Tenneco has already been assigned operatorship, company spokesman Bjoern Tretvoll said.  \n',28
'Norway has offered 10 new offshore blocks to foreign and domestic applicants in the first phase of the country\'s eleventh concession round, government officials said.     Company shares in each of the licences proposed by the Oil and Energy Ministry are not final. The ministry has given the companies 10 days to accept or decline the proposed shares.     French companies Ste Nationale Elf Aquitaine ELFP.PA and Total Cie Francaise des Petroles TPN.PA, which were expected to receive operatorships following France\'s agreement last autumn to purchase gas from Norway\'s Troll field, were not offered operatorships in this round, industry sources said.     Three eleventh round blocks were awarded in the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway, including the Smoerbukk West field where Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S STAT.OL (Statoil) was appointed operator.     Statoil will share the licence with subsidiaries of U.S. Oil companies Tenneco Inc TGT.N and Texas Eastern Corp TET.N and the Italian oil company Agip SpA\'s Norwegian subsidiary.     E.I. Du Pont de Nemours DD.N subsidiary Conoco Norway Inc was named operator on Haltenbanken block 6406/8 and will share the licence with Statoil.     Norsk Hydro A/S NHY.OL will operate nearby block 6407/10 with partners Statoil, Norsk Agip A/S, Royal Dutch/Shell Group\'s RD.AS A/S Norske Shell and Deminex unit Deminex (Norge) A/S.     Statoil has been offered the operatorship on a new block in the relatively unexplored Moere South exploration area south of Haltenbanken, with A/S Norske Shell, Texas Eastern and Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) also offered stakes in the block.     Norwegian companies landed operatorships on all six blocks opened in the Barents Sea area off northern Norway. The blocks were awarded in three licenses, each covering two blocks.     Statoil will head exploration on blocks 7224/7 and 7224/8, sharing the licence with Exxon Corp\'s XON.N Norwegian subsidiary Esso Norge A/S, The British Petroleum Co PLC\'s BP.L BP Petroleum Development (Norway) Ltd, Shell, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum A/S SAGP.OL.     Blocks 7219/9 and 7220/7 were awarded to Norsk Hydro, the operator, Statoil, Mobil Corp\'s MOB.N Mobil Exploration Norway, Petrofina SA\'s PETB.BR Norske Fina A/S and BP.     The third Barents Sea licence, covering blocks 7124/3 and 7125/1, went to Saga Petroleum A/S, the operator, Statoil, Atlantic Richfield Co\'s ARC.N Arco Norge A/S, Total Marine Norge A/S and Amerada Hess Corp AHC.N.     The oil ministry withheld awards on four strategic blocks included in the eleventh round\'s second phase.     The ministry is accepting applications for phase two blocks until early April and the awards will likely be announced this summer, officials said.  \n',28
'The New York Mercantile Exchange said it will introduce exchanges for physicals (EFPS) to its energy futures markets April one.     An exchange spokeswoman said the change will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market.     EFPs, already in effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, are expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts.     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.  \n',28
'The New York Mercantile Exchange set April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.      On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.     \"This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world,\" said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.     Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.      The expanded program \"will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does,\" said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc.      The rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts.     Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction.     Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials.     When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December, NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, \"Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading.\"     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.  \n',28
'Papua New Guinea (PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in the Asia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst Fereidun Fesharaki said here.     The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference.     Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacific petroleum outlook.     With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991, PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharaki said.     The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG.     The PNG government\'s Geological Survey in a paper distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at about 500 mln barrels.     PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with no secondary taxes, Fesharaki said.     \"We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, and discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to (light) Bass Strait crude,\" Fesharaki said.     There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to be produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.     But prices should be somewhat higher than the present levels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.     The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large prospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG.  \n',28
'Top executives with Tenneco Corp TGT and Sabine Corp SAB said they expected world oil prices to gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on imports of oil from the Middle East grows.      \"I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a trend of gradually increasing prices,\" C.W. Nance, president of Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association.      Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the rate of 80 pct of capacity.     The gain will come largely through increased imports to the United States, he said.     \"They will be able to raise the price again but I do not think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979,\" Nance said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.      Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20 dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in 1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between 1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.      \"Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in increased demand,\" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry\'s outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15 pct, he said.      Tenneco\'s Nance also said that some U.S. cities may experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next winter because of the industry\'s reduced deliverability.      Tenneco\'s gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20 pct during 1986, he said.      \"This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,\" Nance said. \"We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three years before we start to climb out?\"       J.C. Walter of Walter Oil and Gas Corp, said the recent improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent producers to begin new onshore drilling projects.      \"If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,\" Walter said.      He suggested that some independents may instead turn to exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel, Walter said.  \n',28
'Foreign oil companies will spend less on exploration in Indonesia this year than last, budgeting 2.7 billion dlrs for calendar 1987 against 1986 spending of 2.8 billion dlrs, the state oil company Pertamina said.     Actual spending last year fell short of the budgeted figure of 3.2 billion dlrs, as oil companies slashed expenditure because of the crash in world oil prices.     Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertamina\'s coordinating board for foreign contractors, said foreign companies will drill 110 exploration wells and 431 development wells this year, against 108 and 330 last year.  \n',28
'Crude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia\'s determined effort to support prices, analysts said.     \"The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting,\" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.     \"But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,\" he added.     Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december.     The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers\' meeting the previous week.     The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.     \"They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales,\" Margoshes said.     He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.     Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.     Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart.     Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, \"both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally.\"     He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions.     Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market.     Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments.     North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.     OPEC members\' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.     Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.     \"The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result,\" Margoshes said.     Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.     But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short.     Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986.  \n',28

He also said that petroleum futures are a major market for oil companies as well as for commodity traders. His remarks were made at the National Petroleum Refiners Association.  \n',28
'A House taxwriter said Energy Secretary James Herrington\'s \"outrageous\" plan to restore an old tax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy.     Rep. Pete Stark, a California Democrat and senior House Ways and Means Committee member, said Herrington\'s plan for a 27.5 pct depletion allowance--which in effect is a special 27.5 pct tax deduction --would cost seven billion dlrs a year.     \"He must have missed the last two years of federal tax reform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle,\" Stark said.     He said in a statement the oil industry already pays an effective lower rate of U.S. tax on investment, 15 pct versus aggregate corporate tax on all investment of 34 pct, according to a recent Congressional Research Service study.  \n',28
'Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said OPEC is deliberately under its production ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels to defend its 18 dlr a barrel price target.     He told reporters at an energy conference in Jakarta that OPEC had decided to maintain its price level of 18 dlrs.     \"We are deliberately defending the price, so OPEC production is less than 15.8 (mln) at the moment,\" he stated.     Asked if OPEC would increase production if prices went above 18 dlrs a barrel, he said this would be decided at the next OPEC meeting in June. \"We will discuss the market situation then,\" he added.     He said a meeting of the OPEC Differentials Committee had been postponed because \"there is no need for the meeting.\"     He did not elaborate. The committee had originally been due to meet in Vienna this week.  \n',28
'OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.     \"The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems,\" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA.     Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.     \"OPEC\'s problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way,\" said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.     He said the market\'s earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.     But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.     \"OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,\" said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. \"The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again,\" he added.     David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.     \"They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens,\" Mizrahi said.     But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.\"     Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC\'s ability to hold together prices and output.     \"OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then,\" said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.     But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University\'s Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production.     \"Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production,\" he tolds in a telephone interview.  \n',28
'Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices.     Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, tolds in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     \"We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,\" he said. \"I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work,\" he said.     Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures.     Told of as survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said; \"That could well be correct.\"     Opec\"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was \"well below\" its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures.     But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.     The survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd.     Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.     Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.     Lukman said that some industry reports \"may be correct\" that in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.     He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States\" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.     However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.     \"We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals,\" he said, adding that he expected it to go \"up and up\" even beyond official prices after early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria\"s.     The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products.     Also, some of Venezuela\"s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said.     Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to \"dangerous levels,\" they would eventually have to buy Opec oil.     \"When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on,\" he said.     Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak.     He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment.     \"At this time, we have to get our priorities right,\" he said. \"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades.\"     But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.  \n',28
'OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.     He told a news conference here \"After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.\"     Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.     \"We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February,\" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.     Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva.     The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.     Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level.     \"The idea was to suggest that OPEC\'s agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,\" Lukman said.     He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC\'s 13 members, adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd.     Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement, while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.     \"If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs,\" the group\'s president said.     He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.     \"Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to,\" he said.     Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied \"We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.\"     Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude.     \"We don\'t see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,\" Lukman said.     The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he said had contributed to the group\'s efforts to stabilise prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market.     \"We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world\'s reserves in OPEC hands, the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly,\" he said.     Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador\'s output following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster.  \n',28
'OPEC output in February was \"well below\" the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries are strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying.     The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result \"of member countries\' firm determination to defend the organisation\'s official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price.\"     The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25.     The official gave no figure for February output. The statement said only that \"the reduction in total supplies, namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month.\"     \"No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price, member countries are, without exception, strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hardship this may entail,\" the statement said.     \"The very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price,\" the statement said.     Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a barrel in early December last year to near OPEC\'s official levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact.     There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main markets.     The official said in the statement that no such emergency session was scheduled \"because of member countries\' firm determination to defend the price (system)\" agreed in December.     Opec\"s differential committee was to have met in Vienna starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no new date set, according to an official of the United Arab Emirates, which chairs the seven-state body.     Other members are Algeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Nigeria and Qatar.  \n',28
'OPEC countries are all sticking firmly to official crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is likely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy Subroto tolds.     Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference, blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand. \"If we stick to the production limitation, the third quarter will be in better balance.\"     He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC\'s December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through.     Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices, Subroto said: \"Apparently they have taken care of that.\"     \"They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves. I think they\'ll help each other,\" he said.     Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC\'s Price Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date.     \"Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting because ... Everyone is sticking to official prices,\" he said.  \n',28
'OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said.     In a speech to a European Community/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said, \"OPEC believes ...the world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs.\"     Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization\'s agreed ceiling for all member countries in February, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said.     \"A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation,\" he said.  \n',28
'Opec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.     He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil.     Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said.     He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec\'s output level was now, he replied: \"Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day).\" He did not elaborate.     He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel\'s December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties.     He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987.     He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting.     He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. \"We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters.\"     Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together.  \n',28

'Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea.     Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens \"the military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions.\"     He said the activities of the research vessel could be aimed at partitioning the Aegean.     \"The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert,\" General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, told a news conference.     He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning.     Ergenc tolds later that all leave had been cancelled for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area.     The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey.      Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus.     The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover.     Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a government decision that Turkey should protect its interests \"because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in violation of international agreements.\"     Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the vessels, he said \"If there is an attack, it is clear what has to be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war.\" But he added \"We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the military are directed towards protecting our rights.\"     Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.     Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions Athens had attached.     In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations \"we will hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped with words.\"     Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only \"The Greek fleet is not at its naval base.\"     Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek continental shelf.     Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept it.     Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus.     He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied \"Obviously, and perhaps even before the war.\"  \n',28
'The Papua New Guinea Government will establish a public corporation to invest in resources projects, Minerals and Energy Minister John Kaputin said.     \"We intend to provide a means through which less privileged individuals can become part owners and beneficiaries from the development of mining and petroleum projects,\" he told Parliament.     Existing policy allowing the state up to 30 pct equity in major mining projects and 22.5 pct in oil and gas projects would be maintained, he said. The planned agency could take over the state\'s equity in current developments.     Kaputin said Papua New Guinea was experiencing a boom with exploration companies spending about 60 mln kina annually on about 150 mining and 23 petroleum projects.     \"The Government is determined to ensure that Papua New Guinean ownership in minerals and petroleum projects increases in an orderly way,\" he said.     Kaputin did not say when the corporation would be established or exactly what form it would take, but said the government would study whether it should be directly involved in exploration or development.  \n',28
'Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220 mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports, wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.     But the French bank\'s plan, which would effectively postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52 members of the loan syndicate.     The pipeline that carries all Ecuador\'s oil exports was ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair.     President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that Ecuador as a result would maintain January\'s suspension of interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.     Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador\'s export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.     Although sympathetic to Ecuador\'s plight, many banks in the Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job for international financial organizations and not for commercial banks, bankers said.     The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a Latin American nation since the region\'s debt crisis erupted in August 1982.     Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions for Latin borrowers will be set back.     \"There\'s a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel it\'s a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a restructuring would look bad,\" one banker commented.  \n',28
'Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. said it will sign a contract March 17 to buy a half interest in a Corpus Christi, Texas refinery and related operations.     The contract, to be signed by PDVSA and Champlin Petroleum\'s parent company, the Union Pacific Corp UNP, will create a new joint venture called Champlin Refining.     The state oil company said PDVSA will pay on the order of 30 mln dlrs for the half interest in Champlin.      Energy minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said Wednesday the cost would be 33 mln dlrs in cash, plus an additional 60 mln in crude and refined oil shipments.     PDVSA and Union Pacific have sought a line of credit from a group of North American and Japanese banks to finance the new company\'s working capital, the Venezuelan company said.     Under the deal, PDVSA will supply up to 140,000 barrels a day to the refinery with the option to place 50,000 bpd more - mostly gasoline and distillates - through Champlin\'s distribution system in 10 U.S. states.

'Mexican state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) signed for a 500 mln dlr&#127;untied loan from the Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance its Pacific Petroleum Project, Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said.     No further details on the loan were immediately available.     Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast.     The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery.     The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said.     Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project, he said. The new pipeline will enable Japan to load Mexico\'s Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan diversify its supply sources of that product, he added.  \n',28
'Pennzoil Co said it had not yet received any \"meaningful settlement offer\" from Texaco Inc but added that the company remained willing to consider proposals to settle the 10.2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against Texaco.     In its newly-released annual report to shareholders, Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be upheld if appealed again.     \"To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful settlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any realistic effort to settle the matter,\" Pennzoil chairman Hugh Liedtke said in the annual report.     Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year.     Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to 964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program, Pennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985.      The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339 mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17 pct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by 60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said.     U.S. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to an average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per day in 1985.     The company\'s total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs.     Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to maintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of Mexico\'s Mobile Bay area.     \"Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California,\" the company said. \"Pennzoil\'s share of this production initially should be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of 15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989.\"     In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled 2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. The average sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long ton from 141.05 dlrs in 1985.     \"The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains bright,\" the company said. \"We expect sulphur\'s pricing structure to strengthen during the current year, probably in the third and fourth quarters.\"               \n',28
'Petro-Canada, Canada\'s state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland.     Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.     Depending on time required for regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as early as 1991, Petro-Canada said.     \"We have a high degree of confidence that the western portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels, and that we could produce it economicly using a floating production system,\" Petro-Canada said.     The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St. John\'s and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984.     \"We\'ve had encouraging results from the eastern portion of the field, and we hope this summer\'s drilling will prove up additional reserves there,\" the company said.     Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources towards development so it can start generating a return on investments, Petro-Canada said.     Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells, has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field\'s East Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd, Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.     Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field\'s Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil, company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada\'s Calgary office.     Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field\'s East Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels, he added.     Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the development budget could double if the company builds a production system combining both blocks in the field, he said.     Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily production, with a production system that would have maximum capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in answer to a query.     The company estimates a production system combining both Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said.  \n',28
'Brazil\'s state-oil company Petrobras has asked the Army to withdraw the troops which were occupying its oil installations since Tuesday, Petrobras said in a statement.     The statement said the request for the withdrawal of the troops was made because of the calmness reigning in all of its refineries.     \"The request was also due to the end of the seamen\'s strike and the willingness of the oil industry workers to sit again by the negotiating table,\" the statement said.     Even though the Petrobras statement said the seamen\'s strike was over, a union spokesman said only two small shipping companies had reached a pay agreement. The overwhelming majority of Brazil\'s seamen remained on strike.     The statement said a meeting between Petrobras and oil industry leaders was set for next Wednesday in Rio, with the presence of Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto as a mediator.     Petrobras said the request for the withdrawal of the troops was made at 1100 local hours (1400 GMT), but a company spokesman said he did not know if the troops had already been removed.  \n',28
'Brazil\'s state oil company Petrobras has cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil and did not disclose reasons, a Petrobras official said.     Export director Carlos Santana told reporters the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil\'s decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of consumption.     He said the Saudis reported they would no longer accept letters of credit from the Bank of Brazil or even from Saudi banks and that Brazil would have to obtain credit guarantees from leading international banks.     In February, Brazil had contracted to buy 125,000 bpd from the Saudis until June. Saudi Arabia is Brazil\'s second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.     \"If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship...I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere,\" Santana added.     Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment.     The Saudis had put similar conditions on a previous shipment, he added. \"We telexed them saying that if they insisted, we would rather cancel the contract and buy the product elsewhere,\" Santana said.     After Petrobras threatened to cancel the contract, the Saudis changed their minds and decided to accept the Bank of Brazil\'s credit guarantees, he said.  \n',28
'Brazil\'s state oil company Petrobras is pledging to export 4.6 mln cubic meters of fuel, or 28.9 mln barrels in 1987, a company spokesman said.     He said that represents a total sale worth 600 mln dlrs. The volume is 27 pct higher over 1986 sales, which totalled 3.6 mln cubic meters, or 22.6 mln barrels.     The United States, Africa and Latin American are Brazil\'s main fuel buyers, the spokesman said.  \n',28
'The port of Philadelphia was closed when a Cypriot oil tanker, Seapride II, ran aground after hitting a 200-foot tower supporting power lines across the river, a Coast Guard spokesman said.     He said there was no oil spill but the ship is lodged on rocks opposite the Hope Creek nuclear power plant in New Jersey.     He said the port would be closed until today when they hoped to refloat the ship on the high tide.     After delivering oil to a refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey, the ship apparently lost its steering and hit the power transmission line carrying power from the nuclear plant to the state of Delaware.  \n',28
'T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman and financier, said he believes the heady days the oil service industry had in the early 1980s, when over 4,500 oil rigs were once reported operating, will not return in his lifetime.      Pickens tolds he expects the rig count to drop to below 600 before recovering. He added that oil prices will eventually rise to 35 dlrs, then to 50 dlrs after 1990.      Currently, some 700 oil rigs are operating in the U.S., down sharply after oil prices slipped from 30 dlrs in late 1985 to around 10 dlrs in 1986. Prices are now around 18 dlrs. The highest number of working rigs was 4,500 in December 1981.      \"The rigs won\'t go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs,\" he said, adding that while he expects to see 50 dlr a barrel oil, he does not expect to see 2,000 rigs operating in his lifetime. Pickens is 58.      Pickens, who is currently touring the country promoting his autobiography \"Boone,\" said he does not believe the U.S. should impose an oil import fee in order to stimulate the domestic oil industry.  \n',28

Powerine, a privately-held company, said it expects the refinery to become fully operational by May, with crude oil throughput at 35,000 bpd.     Initial oil products deliveries are scheduled for Monday, Powerine said. The refinery had been closed due to a change of ownership, the company said.  \n',28
'President Reagan said the United States must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil.     President Reagan said during a nationally televised news conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a problem that the administration is studying.     \"We have to study this more,\" Reagan said. \"This is why we increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve, but we have to do more,\" he said.     Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production.     However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures.     The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It suggested options for the administration to consider, but made no specific recommendations.  \n',28

'Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer reiterated the kingdom\'s commitment to last December\'s OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said.     Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia \"is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.\"     Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market prices \"may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market.\"     Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord, under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs.     Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia\'s adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.     He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord.     In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement.     \"We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions,\" he said.     Kuwait\'s Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said in remarks published in the emirate\'s daily Al-Qabas there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices.     Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling.     They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing.  \n',28
'King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group.     His plea, in an interview withs and the television news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make to Britain later this month.     King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price agreed to by OPEC last December.     The King replied: \"Saudi Arabia doesn\'t decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability.\"     Non-OPEC countries \"must help us in a framework of common interest so that there is no type of competition which could prove harmful to everyone,\" he said.     Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher benchmark.     In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure, due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd said Saudi Arabia, the world\'s largest oil exporter, was adhering to decisions made at OPEC\'s December conference which set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987.     A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the group\'s pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.     The King also urged the world community to help the Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful end to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not be resolved on the battlefield, he said.  \n',28
'Saudi Arabian business leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom\'s oil-dependent economy.     The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices.     The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea, has been organised by Saudi Arabia\'s chambers of commerce.     Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day.     Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year\'s slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance.     Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia, the world\'s largest crude exporter, needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy.     The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans.     Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel.     With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a 52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves.     The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community.     Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non-performing loans.     But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate finance manager in Riyadh said: \"Banks are still reluctant to lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am not sure if it is firmly based.\"     Some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy may still be contracting.     Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply. A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the budget said: \"While industrialisation has continued to be one of the government\'s highest priorities, the recession, the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi and foreign investor interest in industry.\"     It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here.     Official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March 1986, compared with the same period in 1985.     Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983.     Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit.     Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories. Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments.     The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of bank debt.     Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to step up investment in the kingdom.     A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft worth five billion stg.  \n',28
'Saudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources said.     They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju\'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers.     But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.     The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country\'s output for Opec purposes.     Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.     The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end.     Last week\'s high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia\'s main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.     The four -- Exxon Corp XON, Mobil Corp MOB, Texaco Inc TX and Chevron Corp CHV -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.     However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia\'s ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.     Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom\'s commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices.     The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries.     They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain\'s refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each.  \n',28
'Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC\'s December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it.

Saudi Arabia, the world\'s largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact, Nazer said.     The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.     Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: \"I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled.\"     Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements.     \"We\'ve heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified,\" he said.     OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.     Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.     Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.     \"As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement,\" he said.     Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, Nazer said.     King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview withs and Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC.     \"Saudi Arabia doesn\'t decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability,\" he said.     Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of \"swing producer\" within OPEC.     Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states.     \"Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC,\" Nazer said.     Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.     But he said if circumstances changed \"I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures.\"     Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer.     Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC\'s behalf earlier this year.     \"We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions,\" Nazer said.

'Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of the kingdom\'s determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources said.     They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average of 3.5 mln bpd.     They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be counted towards a member\'s production quota. Saudi Arabia\'s quota is 4.133 mln bpd.     The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the world\"s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the sources said.     King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview withs and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi commitment to OPEC\'s December pact to boost oil prices to an average 18 dlrs.     \"Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,\" he said.     The sources said the kingdom\'s exports from Gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday, down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd.     They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain artificially high levels by putting oil into storage.     The kingdom\'s main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon, Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay official prices, the sources said.     Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.     They expected low early March output to pick up towards the end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual obligations.  \n',28
'Saudi riyal interbank deposits were steady at yesterday\'s higher levels in a quiet market.     Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions amidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting the current decline in oil prices.     Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency meeting of the 13-member organisation.     A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity.     Spot-next and one-week rates were put at 6-1/4, 5-3/4 pct after quotes ranging between seven, six yesterday.     One, three, and six-month deposits were quoted unchanged at 6-5/8, 3/8, 7-1/8, 6-7/8 and 7-3/8, 1/8 pct respectively.     The spot riyal was quietly firmer at 3.7495/98 to the dollar after quotes of 3.7500/03 yesterday.  \n',28
'Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.     Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.     \"Over the next few weeks I think you\'ll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down,\" Wellemeyer said.     \"The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a barrel) and are willing to make it happen again,\" he said.     In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.     Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.     Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the world demand for oil.  \n',28
'Saudi Arabia has dropped its condition that Brazil secure international bank guarantees before Saudia Arabia would ship it oil, state-oil company Petrobras said in a statement.     Petrobras said the Saudis will accept Banco do Brasil credit guarantees.     Petrobras cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from the Saudis yesterday after they refused to accept a letter of credit from the official Bank of Brazil. The Saudis had demanded that Brazil get credit guarantees from leading international banks.     Petrobras said the Saudis had been advised that if they did not change their mind by Monday, Petrobras would negotiate the purchase of oil with other producers.     The Petrobras statement said the shipment of 2.2 mln barrels will be made by the Saudis on March 24 as scheduled.     The shipment was part of a contract signed in February for the Saudis to supply Brazil with 125,000 barrels per day until June.  \n',28
'The Senate budget committee sits down tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with the budget writers expected to look at several proposals for fuel taxes and other tax options to cut the budget.     In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number of revenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrs a barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just on imported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energy consumption based on five pct of value.     Other proposals include various excise taxes and combinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10 pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise 22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years.     The committee, however, will only include revenue numbers in its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left to the House and Senate tax-writing committees.      The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, Sen Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, said he hopes would raise at least 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36 billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind.     The House Budget Committee also plans to start drafting a separate budget plan later this week, which would have to be reconciled with the Senate version. The final budget would be the fiscal 1988 spending and revenue blueprint.   \n',28
'Sen. Pete Domenici, a main sponsor of legislation to set an oil import fee, said the administration\'s energy security report was based on flawed economic assumptions.     The New Mexico Republican said the report did not take into account the last few weeks\' drop in domestic oil production in its statement that an oil fee would raise prices for consumers. The report said a decline in economic growth as a result of the fee would reduce tax revenues. \"A five dlr (per barrel) oil import fee will provide the stimulus to create jobs and investment, \" and raise revenues, he said.  \n',28
'Analyst Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers said he recommended a number of oil stocks today now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded in holding to its prescribed production quotas.     \"It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quota restraint, will boost the price of oil,\" Margoshes said.     Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to higher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas. Margoshes said he recommends Imperial Oil IMO.A, up 1/2 to 49-1/8, Standard Oil Co SRD, 7/8 to 62-3/4, Exxon XON one to 83-1/8, and Chevron CHV 1-1/8 to 54-7/8.     In addition, Margoshes said he recommended Atlantic Richfield ARC on a short-term basis, though he said he is still suspect about its debt situation. Atlantic Richfield rose 1-3/4 to 77.     He said \"the market could come down to test the 16 dlr a barrel level again, but the main thrust of investing in oil is positive right now. Before the year is out we will see higher oil prices.\"     He noted that belief that the government is interested in raising the strategic reserves is factored into the rise in oil stocks today.  \n',28
'Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group RD ST, scheduled its annual maintenance refinery shutdowns during the next two months, company spokeswoman Judy Wish said.     Wish said refineries will stockpile production before the shutdowns to maintain normal supply while maintenance is carried out.     Production at Shell\'s major refinery at Strathcona Alberta, will be closed for about one month, Wish said.     There will be no layoffs associated with the refinery maintenance, she added.  \n',28
'A/S Norske Shell, Royal Dutch/Shell Group\'s RD.AS Norwegian subsidiary, said it has nearly concluded a 10 billion crown development scheme for Norway\'s Draugen oil field and will declare the field commercial in the near future.     Pending government approval of the scheme, the field could come on stream in 1992, making it Norway\'s northermost field development and the first such project on the Haltenbanken tract off central Norway.     Work on the project could begin as early as January 1988, a Shell spokesman said.     Shell has not released projected output levels for the field, where water depth is 240-270 meters.     The spokesman said the field\'s partners have agreed to develop Draugen with a 300-meter, single-leg concrete gravity-base platform.     The scheme also proposes using remote subsea production wells to tap the field\'s reservoir, estimated to contain 375 mln barrels of oil, and an offshore buoy-loading system to transport oil from the field by ship.     Partners on Draugen are Shell, the operator, with a 30 pct stake, British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L unit BP Petroleum Development (Norway) Ltd (20 pct) and state-owned Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S STAT.OL (Statoil) (50 pct).  \n',28
'South Africa\'s state-owned energy firm Soekor said it would continue tests after striking oil some 120 kms (75 miles) south-southwest of Mossel Bay.     During production tests, about 5,000 barrels of oil and five mln cubic feet of gas per day were produced, it said.     \"This oil discovery will be followed-up as soon as possible by further seismic surveys and drilling. Should further drilling and tests in the area yield positive results oil production from a floating platform could be considered.\"     Director General of Mineral and Energy Affairs Louw Alberts announced the strike earlier but said it was uneconomic.  \n',28
'A study group said the United States should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry.     U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750 mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.     The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private group, also called for new research for oil exploration and development techniques.     It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.     The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: to protect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other such device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil.     But the group did not strongly back either option, saying there were benefits and drawbacks to both.     It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports.  \n',28
'A government study has concluded the U.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability, the New York Times said.     The newspaper said the inter-agency government study found a serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily falling domestic production and rising demand for imported oil.     The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relying on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peak of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.     The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from 27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said.     It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the current 8.4 mln barrels.     The newspaper said the administration has placed increased emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now held is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times of shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day, rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget.    The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the depletion allowance to major producers.     \"The administration also plans to renew its efforts to ...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling on the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers,\" it added.     The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma as saying the study greatly underestimated potential U.S. Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimated the amount of domestic oil which would be produced.  \n',28
'The sharp drop in world oil prices the past year triggered a 60 pct increase in bankruptcies in the country\'s oil states, according to a study released by the American Petroleum Institute (API).     API said the Dunn and Bradstreet study found that business failures rose nationally by 6.9 pct in 1986 over 1985, but in the \"oil patch\" of the Southwest the increase was 59.9 pct.     It said bankruptcies in Texas were up 57.4 pct, Oklahoma, 55.9 pct, Colorado, 55.8 pct and Louisiana, 46.6 pct.     In Alaska, failures rose by 66.2 per cent, it said.

Asked about the prospect for oil prices, he said: \"I think they will stabilise around 18 dlrs, although there is a little turbulence ...\"     \"Of course the spot price will fluctuate, but the official price will remain at 18 dlrs,\" he added.  \n',28
'Petroleum futures rallied today in a market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and became further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting.     Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17 cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel.     \"Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will not remain there long if products are not strong,\" Robert Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said.     Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report.     Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore oil fields and an oil export depot.     Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York.     Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the close with support from the silver market, which was approaching two-year highs, traders said.     Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher.     Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which is limiting supplies.     In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Monday\'s report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders said.     Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.     Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales have been lighter than expected this week.     The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.     Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength related to tight supplies.     Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat packers to bid aggressively for available animals.     However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start of the year.     New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.  \n',28
'Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells.     Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers.     His proposal to revitalize Texas\' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state\'s 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas\' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production.     Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.     Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel.     \"We\'ve been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,\" Nugent said. \"In other words, let\'s tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way.\"     Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry.  \n',28

'British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her government\'s oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil prices.     She said the government was determined not to intervene to influence production decisions by oil companies operating in the North Sea.     \"We believe these must be a matter for the commercial judgment of the oil companies,\" she told the Arabic language daily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit to London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.     Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel.     British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to increase in the future, she said.     \"We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility for both producer and consumer countries,\" Thatcher said.     \"On our part, we are careful to avoid any actions which might add to such volatility.\"  \n',28
'Treasury Secretary James Baker told the House Appropriations Committee that he believes the president remains opposed to an oil import fee.     He said Reagan last year rejected the idea and he added:     \"In my personal view he is not likely to change his thinking on that.\"     He said Reagan last year opposed the idea because the energy industry was divided on the issue, a tax would require a new bureacracy to administer and the resulting higher energy prices would harm U.S. competitiveness.  \n',28
'The U.K. Offshore oil industry has suffered from last year\'s collapse in oil prices but should not sustain any permament damage, Minister of State for Energy Alick Buchanan-Smith said.     The drilling, diving and supply vessels sectors had been most affected, Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energy committee. He noted, however, that oil companies were still spending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production.     He added that a report by the manpower services committee which said 14,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1986 should be seen in the context of a total workforce of 300,000.     Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of 8.50 dlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs the previous November.     They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after last December\'s OPEC meeting and Brent traded today around 17.15 dlrs.     Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adopting OPEC style quotas, noting that Britian is an oil-consuming as well as an oil-producing nation.  \n',28
'Energy Secretary John Herrington said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration.     \"These options boost production, while avoiding the huge costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,\" Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. \"It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review.\"     He said proposals, including an increase in the oil depletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax, should be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at the least cost to the economy and the taxpayers.     \"The goal of the Administration policies is to increase domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a year.\"     The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday warning the United States was threatened by a growing dependence on oil imports.     \"We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65 pct by 1995,\" Herrington said.     He said it was too soon to say what the Administration policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would be opposition to tax changes.     \"Of course, to move forward with these kinds of options would require reopening tax issues settled last year (in the tax reform bill) -- an approach which has not, in general, been favored by the administration. I think what we need is to debate this within the Administration,\" he said.     He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices.     Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today\'s Washington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging an increase in the oil depletion allowance.     Asked about the report by subcommittee members, Herrington said various proposals were under consideration and would be debated within the Administration to determine which would have the most benefits at the least cost.  \n',28
'an eventual oil import fee in the united states will make no difference to champlin petroleum corp\'s joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa), champlin chairman william adams said.     \"this was an aspect which was discussed at length during the negotiations, but we can say our contract covers all eventualities in this regard,\" he tolds during the signing ceremony here.     Venezuela\'s energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsa buys 50 pct of champlin\'s corpus christi refinery, as \"one more step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in world markets.\"    union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will be beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source of supply with a modern refinery and access to markets.     \"we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a time of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are clear benefits to both sides,\" he said.     Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and obtain a competitive product yield.     \"therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact on today\'s agreement,\" adams said.     He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as venezuela\'s bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without any difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet to take advantage of bigger margins.     The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd of venezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pct yield of white products.  \n',28
'A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies.     The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the Reagan administration\'s controversial off-shore leasing program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.     The administration said that the court-ordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980.     A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos.     But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration.     \"Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable,\" Justice Byron White wrote for the court. \"And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined,\" he said.     The oil companies, Amoco Corp AN, ARCO, Exxon Corp XON, Mobil Corp MOB, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc TX and Union Oil, had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses.     The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs.     Administration officials, saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.     The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with an organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing.  \n',28
'Tonight\'s American Petroleum Institute weekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns in distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27, analysts and traders said.     They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln barrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3 and four mln barrels.     Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5 mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from the previous week or slightly higher or lower.     For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between 700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance gasoline stocks will be unchanged.     API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels.     The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal factors but they said crude direction is harder to call.     Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between 3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended March 27.     API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up three pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said utilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by less than one pct for the week ended March 27.     Moderate product stockdraws would strengthen the market slightly, analysts said. But bullish expectations are already partially reflected in today\'s gains, they added.  \n',28
'Energy Secretary John Herrington said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to spur domestic production.     The White House has said it would consider the option although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new tax code.     Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a year.     The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and the national security the Energy Department sent to the White House on Tuesday.     Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance option: \"that is one that could significantly increase production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer.\"     He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to the overall U.S. economy.  \n',28
'The U.S. oil and gas industry is in better health than it was a year ago, according to testimony given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of the industry hearing today.      The Commission, which regulates the state\'s oil and gas industry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry downturn had bottomed out.      \"The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal more optimistic (than last year),\" Commissioner James E. (Jim) Nugent tolds.      \"It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are seeing the bottom of the economic cycle,\" he added, \"and with just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move again.\"      The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil prices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to around 18 dlrs a barrel.      At the same time, a number of company executives testified that the nation\'s domestic exploration and production segment was still hurting and in need of government help.      Production costs are considerably higher in the United States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell many domestic producers were forced to shut down their operations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs operating in the United States compared with an average of nearly 2,000 in 1985.      Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of Energy, many said the falling production of domestic oil coupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing dependency on imports, particularly from the politically volatile Middle East.      \"In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower prices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day (bpd),\" said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply Department at Exxon Corp XON, the nation\'s largest oil company.      At the same time, Simon said \"U.S. oil production declined by 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years,\" and \"net petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd.\"      Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC\'s ability to control production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at 1986 levels, leading to \"a significant amount of spare worldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd.\"      He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued volatility and called for \"governmental and regulatory policies in support of the domestic petroleum industry.\"      Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal government through the 1986 tax code changes and \"Superfund\" legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall profits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access to federal lands for oil and gas exploration.      Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the industry have called for as a way of building up the nation\'s domestic operations before imports reach such a level that national security might be compromised.      In yesterday\'s report, the Energy Department said imports could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the free world\'s total oil consumption by that date.      Arguing that \"oil is a political tool in every nation on earth,\" Frank Pitts, chairman of Pitts Oil Co, today called for a variable oil import fee, among other measures, \"before the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and our national security is compromised.\"      Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co, agreed, saying that like many federal government programs that were set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a \"shambles.\"      Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future. \"For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is over,\" he said.      Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co, said he was \"enthusiastic about the future,\" adding that he expected \"an increase in profitability by midyear.\"  \n',28
'U.S. Department of Energy Secretary John Herrington said he was \"optimistic\" about the chances of providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas producers, but added that the plan faces strong opposition from some members of the Reagan administration.     Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at a breakfast meeting, said administration debate over his plan for a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was \"heavy and strong\" largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the agriculture industry.     Herrington\'s proposed tax incentives for the oil industry were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a comprehensive report finding U.S. national security could be jeopardized by rising oil imports.     In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and Development Corp MND chairman, George Mitchell, Herrington said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import tarrif. \"We intend to keep that debate open,\" Herrington said.     However, following his speech, Herrington tolds that the new report shows an oil import fee \"is not economical.\"     Herrington said, for example, a 10 dlr per barrel tariff on oil imports would cause the nation\'s gross national product to drop by as much as 32 billion dlrs.     Herrington also said he believed President Reagan, who requested the comprehensive national security study, was committed to some action to help the ailing U.S. oil industry.     \"I\'m quite confident he understands the problems and is prepared to do something about it,\" Herrington said.  \n',28
'The U.S. Has offered warships to escort Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf past Iranian anti-ship missile batteries, Defence Department officials said.     The officials tolds yesterday the offer was made last week by Navy Admiral William Crowe, chairman of the Pentagon Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a Middle East visit.     Reagan administration officials said later that Washington did not seek military confrontation with Tehran, but would not let Iran use Chinese-made \"Silkworm\" anti-ship missiles, capable of covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf, to choke oil shipments to the West.     Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection for up to a dozen vessels, most of them tankers, could be provided by three U.S. Navy destroyers and two frigates now in the southern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.     In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy\'s small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships, including the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, into the northern Arabian Sea in the past month.     White House and defence officials said that massing the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran\'s stationing of missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.     The State Department said on Friday that Iran has been told about U.S. Concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf. The communication was sent through Switzerland, which represents U.S. Interests in Iran.     Iran denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf and said any U.S. Interference in the region would meet a strong response, Tehran Radio said on Sunday.     Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984 in the so-called tanker war, an offshoot of their 6-1/2-year-old ground conflict.  \n',28
'Treasury Secretary James Baker and Office of Management and Budget chief James Miller defended an administration plan to sell the U.S. Naval Petroleum Reserves.     In response to hostile questioning from a member of the House Appropriations Committee, the officials said the plan was justified to help bring the fiscal 1988 budget deficit and to get the government out of the oil business.     Miller acknowleged the estimated sale proceeds at 3.3 billion dlrs would actually bring down the deficit by about 2.2 billion dlrs because of the loss of revenues from the sale of oil from the reserves.     Miller said the sale price may end up higher.     \"We\'d sell it to the highest bidder,\" Miller said.     \"If we can get more we\'ll take it.\"  \n',28
'The White House said a proposal for a tax break for the oil industry would undergo review.     Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan had no position on recommendations submitted by Energy Secretary John Herrington to encourage investment in the hard hit domestic oil industry.     But Fitzwater noted that Reagan did have a fundamental objection to tax rises and special tax breaks.     He said that even though Herrington\'s recommendation did not agree with existing policy, \"We\'ll take a look at it.\"     The review will be undertaken by the president\'s Domestic Policy Council.     Herrington\'s proposal was reported by the Washington Post to have been made in a letter to Reagan submitting a study that found the United States would be importing half of its oil by the 1990s, threatening U.S. national security.  \n',28
'The United States has offered Navy warships to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers into and out of the  Gulf where they could be threatened by new Iranian anti-ship missiles, U.S. defense officials said today.     \"We believe the Kuwaitis have also approached the Soviet Union about the possibility of using Soviet tankers\" to ship their oil, one of the officials tolds. \"But if there is superpower protection, we would rather it come from us,\" the official said.     The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Kuwait had asked about possible protection for a dozen vessels, most of them oil tankers, which could be supplied by three U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates now in the southern part of the Gulf.     \"We told them we would give them help and we are waiting to hear the Kuwaiti response to our offer,\" one official said.     In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy\'s small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships -- including the Aircraft Carrier Kitty Hawk -- into the northern Indian Ocean in the past month.     White House and defense officials said today that massing of the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran\'s recent stationing of Chinese-made  anti-ship missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.     The land-based missiles have increased concern in Kuwait and other Middle East countries that their oil shipments might be affected. Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the  Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today that it was in the U.S. strategic interest to keep the free flow of oil in the gulf and through the Straits of Hormuz.     But he said U.S. ships in the region were on routine maneuvers.     Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Sunday declined to discuss specifics, but said the United States would do whatever was necessary to keep the Gulf shipping open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the region.     \"We are fully prepared to do what\'s necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway of the world,\" he said on NBC television\'s \"Meet the Press.\"     The State Department said Friday Iran has been informed about U.S. concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf. The communciation was sent through Switzerland, which represents American interests in Iran.      Iran on Sunday denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the gulf and warned the United States that any interference in the region would meet a strong response from Tehran, Tehran Radio said.     An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted in a broadcast monitored by the BBC in London, said reports that Iran intends to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless.     \"In conjunction with this misleading propaganda, America has already paved the ground to achieve its expansionist and hegemonistic intentions, aiming to build up its military presence in the region,\" he was quoted as saying.  \n',28

'The U.S. should reassess its Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on imported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.      \"The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the Gulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commission report, mandate more than ever before the need for a fundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,\" Ebinger said.      He remarks were made in an address to the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting.      \"Although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct link between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in the current environment it will be increasingly difficult for moderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S. interests,\" Ebinger said.      Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crude oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be weaker if demand falls in the spring.     But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, said crude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring.     There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking at the annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chance that crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of the year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June.     He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement to restrict production.     OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June because the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  has declined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said.     OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollar has fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months.     Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 to four mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 to two mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd.  \n',28

'A White House-ordered report said  that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security.     The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.     President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry.     Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that \"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years, this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.\"     The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.     Among the report\'s options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.     President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s.     The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would depress the nation\'s economy.     The study was outlined in a New York Times report today.  \n',28
'The \"cross field allowance\" relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.     The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.     A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field.     \"The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability,\" the report said, adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced.     The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax, the report said.     On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.     In a study on probable fields, the report said that when the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9 pct.     The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field\'s future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost.     Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time.  \n',28
'Petroleos de Venezuela S.A will announce within two weeks the name of a foreign consortium it has chosen to help exploit the coal deposits at Guasare in western Zulia state, PDVSA president Juan Chacin Guzman said.     Chacin told reporters the foreign partner will provide capital as well as technical and marketing expertise to the Carbozulia project, which the state oil company will manage.     PDVSA officials said that among those who bid for the partnership is a consortium between Agip Carbone, a subsidiary of Italy\'s Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI), and Atlantic Richfield ARC of the United States.

'Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today.     He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a visit here this week by Ecuador\'s Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in August.     Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to offsetting the loss of Ecuador\'s 140,000 in exports caused by earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week.     Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao was put out of action.     Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador\'s is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.     Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs.     The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries.     \"If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this country would have ground to a halt,\" he said.  \n',28
'venezuela will supply ecuador with an as yet undetermined amount of crude oil to help it meet export commitments, seriously affected by last week\'s earthquake, energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti said.     He gave few details about the deal, but said a crude oil loan agreement will be made between state oil companies petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa) and ecuador\'s cepe.     Ecuador was forced to suspend oil exports for an expected four months after an earthquake damaged a pipeline. Oil accounts for 60 per cent of its export income.      Hernandez was speaking to reporters at miraflores palace on the results of talks with ecuador\'s deputy energy minister fernando santos alvite, who arrived here last night.     \"the volume lent to ecuador would be discounted from its opec quota and would not affect venezuela\'s,\" he said. \"we would from august on produce our own quota and sell the additional amounts that ecuador would be repaying us,\" he said.     He did not elaborate on the quota arrangements but did say ecuador would notify opec by telex that venezuela would be lending it a certain amount over so many days.

'Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5 mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments and its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement.     Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake.     Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export commitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crude and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said.      Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that would take an estimated five  months.     Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for refining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired.     Both countries are the only Latin American members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

'Venezuela\'s state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. wants to raise its worldwide refining capacity by 150,000 barrels of per day, a company official attending the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting here said.     He declined to be identified but said PdVSA has the capacity to refine about 650,000 bpd of crude oil from refining centers in Venezuela, Sweden, West Germany, Belgium, and the United States. The company recently purchased a 50 pct stake in the Corpus Christi, Texas refinery of Champlin Petroleum Co, a subsidiary of Union Pacific Corp UNP.     Earlier it bought a similar stake in the Lake Charles, La refinery owned by Citgo Petroleum Corp, a unit of Southland Corp SLC.      According to the official, Venezuela is searching worldwide for the additional refining capacity but he did not mention where the company was looking.      Refineries abroad, he said, guarantee a refining outlet for Venezuelan crude oil while ensuring stability of supply to refiners.     He said Venezuela currently  produces about 1.4 mln bpd of crude oil, which is in line with its 1.495 bpd OPEC ceiling.  \n',28
'Venezuela has still to work out final details of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports caused by earthquake damage, a senior Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) official said.     \"We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be affected,\" he said during the signing of a joint venture deal with Union Pacific Corp today.     He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by Ecuador\'s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite.     He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be considered. Venezuela, possibly unique among oil exporters, requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to ensure its oil is not resold on the spot market.     Ecuador\'s oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador\'s account and remit the revenues to Quito. Ecuador would pay back the oil at a rate of 35,000 bpd.     He said Venezuela\'s oil would be traded through Ecuadorean state oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company never allows third parties to trade its oil.  \n',28

'The National Wildlife Federation  rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration.     The federation, the nation\'s largest conservation group, said further study was needed to assess any possible damage that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.     Jay Hair, the federation\'s executive vice president, called the Interior\'s research into the effects of development \"so fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on which to make a public policy decision.\"     Hair called the department\'s proposal a \"reflection of a largely political decision,\" adding \"we have no confidence in Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area.\"     Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough  safeguards to protect the area\'s caribou and musk-oxen.     It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration.     Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10 billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain.     Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development.     Hair said Interior\'s report failed to stress the probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct.     He said Interior\'s study also failed to weigh oil, gas, fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection Agency on the possible effects of exploration.     The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the issue and report back to Congress in about two years.     Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible exploration of oil, only that Interior\'s study was inadquate to make a sound judgement.     Congressional observers said that at present there was little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil.  \n',28
'World Bank president Barber Conable pledged the Bank\'s support to help Indonesia adjust to lower world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its protected economy was needed.     Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto, he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy.     Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third World\'s sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years.     Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices.     \"We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,\" he said.     He said Jakarta\'s willingness to move quickly after last year\'s collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries.     Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy.     However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place.     Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met 14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country\'s borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the country.  \n',28
'World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia, the Third World\'s sixth largest debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said.     Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers.     He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia\'s largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments.     Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia\'s most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely hit by last year\'s crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and gas revenues in half.     Japan\'s state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.     Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31 pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit.     Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia\'s high-cost protected economy.     \"Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call for major policy adjustments and external support,\" Conable said in his arrival statement.     But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes.     \"We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed,\" Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport.     Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the Third World\'s sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.     Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.     Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government\'s trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.     Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment.     Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia\'s 215 state-run companies could be sold.     But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.     Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia\'s high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy.     Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices.     It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation.      He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector.

McIvor, an Exxon Corp XON Director and senior vice president tolds in an interview.     \"Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable,\" McIvor said.     Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said.     McIvor, Exxon\'s senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideast\'s large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.     \"Since 1970 we\'ve been consuming oil at rates of 20-25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10-15 bilion barrels per year,\" McIvor said.     \"The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity,\" he added.     McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 \"one-one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.\"     McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not believe there were any more \"super giants\", or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which would change the conclusion of the world\'s growing dependency.     \"Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east (Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska\'s North Slope).\" McIvor said.     McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S. like Alaska\'s Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline.     But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and Australia and Africa.     McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies.     \"The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies,\" McIvor said.     McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy.     Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but \"the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase U.S. production.\"     McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs.     \"Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkd\'s energy supply,\" McIvor said.     \"Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an industrial fuel,\" he added.  \n',28
