'The Cyprus vessel Fearless, 31,841 tonnes dw, which was on fire, grounded then towed to Yantai, China, in August, had all its cargo reloaded but the cargo in the no. 3 hold caught fire on October 15.     The fire was put out with salt water and water from the no.4 hold has spread over most of the cargo. Some water is also in the no.5 hold. Bottom patching was reported complete but only the no.4 starboard wing tank has been pumped out and remains dry. The engine room is flooded to about three metres.     The ship was originally loaded with 10,000 tonnes of animal feed.  \n',ship
'Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW), Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.     The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said. The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration Commission today.     Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.     The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to protest changes to the state\'s workers\' compensation laws.  \n',ship

The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of each shift and then to walk off.     Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with container movements most affected, but has not stopped altogether, they said.     They said they could not say how long the disruption will go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.  \n',ship
'Union and New South Wales government officials have reached a compromise in a dispute over workers compensation, averting increased industrial action in the state, union sources said.     But some unions, including those of building and mining workers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would continue their strikes for a few more days.     State officials said the government had agreed to revise its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly higher cash benefits for injured workers.     Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and other industrial action in the state on April 7, workers\' compensation would have been cut by one third. Full details of the compromise package are not yet known.     The Labour Council, affiliated to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), had threatened to paralyse New South Wales unless the government modified its pending legislation on the issue.     State officials said the only sectors affected in the past three days were some government building projects, railway freight movement and cargo handling in Sydney\'s ports.  \n',ship
'The navy is unloading foodgrains at Chittagong port following a strike by nearly 1,000 dockworkers, Bangladesh Shipping Corp officials said.     The navy was unloading 74,000 tonnes of foodgrains from two ships today, and four vessels laden with some 90,000 tonnes of grains were waiting at the outer anchorage, port officials said.     A spokesman for the workers said they would continue their strike until authorities agree to their demands for higher pay and other benefits. The strike began on June 11.     \"Unloading of grains and other essential commodities started normally after we called in navy personnel to help,\" a port official tolds.     \"The strike has caused no serious dislocation,\" he said.     The government meanwhile declared the port jobs an \"essential service\" and said the strikers could be dismissed unless they end the strike soon.  \n',ship
'A 24-hour strike by Belgian public employees protesting against a government pay offer disrupted transport and hit ferry services and shipping, port and union officials said.     Some cross-Channel ferry services from Ostend were cancelled, the local news agency Belga said.     An Antwerp port authority spokesman said electricians came out in support, reducing ship movements to a trickle. Unions said Ghent and other major Belgian ports were also hit.     Few trains were running and some early morning flights by Sabena, Belgian\'s national airline, were cancelled.  \n',ship
'U.S. moves to increase its warships in and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.     They said the American decision inevitably carries some risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.     \"As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the Gulf could do serious damage,\" said one western diplomat.     Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks on \"soft targets\" such as merchant shipping not protected by American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.     The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated by diplomats as low. However, \"There is the threat that the Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers, will go for softer targets,\" one diplomat said.     Tehran Radio quoted Iran\'s top defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was \"moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.\"     The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.     The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.     Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by Iran, angered at the emirate\'s war backing of Iraq.     Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.     The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.     A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.     \"But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti territory would be a very serious escalation\" likely moving world opinion against Iran, remarked one.     Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.     Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted last Friday \"a river of blood\" throughout the world in the event of any U.S. strike against Iran.     Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.     Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.     Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.  \n',ship
'China has resumed repairs of Soviet ships after a 23 year break caused by the ideological split between the two countries.     The New China News Agency said an agreement to resume the business was signed by the two sides on Wednesday in Shanghai, where three Soviet commercial vessels were being repaired.     The China Daily said the first two Soviet ships to be repaired in China since 1964 left the ports of Dalian and Xingang last month.     Bi Yueran, managing director of China State Shipbuilding Corp\'s ship repair department, told the newspaper the Soviet Union lacked adequate repair facilities for the more than 600 ships deployed in the far east. Bi said China\'s yards offered competitive prices, guaranteed quality and prompt delivery.  \n',ship
'Sri Lanka today ordered its armed forces to defend the island\'s territorial waters as India prepared to send a flotilla with relief supplies that Colombo says it does not want for the Tamils in the Jaffna peninsula.     The sudden crisis between Sri Lanka and its giant neighbour deepened as Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa told parliament: \"We have our territorial limits and nobody can be allowed to trespass there ...     \"President (Junius) Jayewardene has ordered the army, navy and air force to protect the island and its territorial waters,\" Premadasa said to a round of applause from the house.     In New Delhi an Indian spokesman said the plan to send a flotilla of 20 small unarmed boats with Red Cross supplies to Jaffna tomorrow would go ahead despite Colombo\'s objections.     The confrontation was the latest result of the long and bitter conflict between Sri Lanka\'s Buddhist Sinhalese majority and the Hindu Tamil minority, which has strong ethnic and cultural links with India\'s 50 mln Tamils.  \n',ship
'A new convoy of tankers escorted by American warships headed down the Gulf on Wednesday, towards Iranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having being blasted by U.S. Navy raiders.     Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well clear of Iran\'s Silkworm missiles, however, and frontline emirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat.     \"I think the predominant feeling ... Is of being scared this conflict will escalate,\" a top West German Foreign Ministry official, Helmut Schaefer, told reporters in Bahrain after a tour of three Gulf states. b     Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six sea captains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday\'s U.S. Raids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying the Gulf.     Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulf would stay out for the time being following Monday\'s U.S. Action.     But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat assaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the area.     Iran, having vowed to react strongly after Monday\'s U.S. Action, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule.     For its part, Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday that it was ready for any further hostile action.     Pentagon officials then announced that a U.S. Guided missile destroyer began escorting two Kuwaiti tankers flying the U.S. flag southwards--the 80,000 tonne product carrier Ocean City and 46,000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King.  \n',ship
'Rising water levels on the Rhine caused by heavy rain are delaying an operation near Karlsruhe to raise two sunken boats which have blocked the river\'s main navigation channel since early last week, a Karlsruhe water authority spokesman said.     He said two floating cranes were unable to begin lifting the sunken tug Orinoko and its lighter because the water level had reached 815 centimetres and was forecast to rise to 820-830 cm by tomorrow. He was unable to say when the operation might begin.     Meanwhile, high water at Cologne has forced vessels to travel at reduced speed, a water authority spokesman in Cologne said. But a water authority spokesman in Duisburg, 60 kms north of Cologne, said vessels there were moving normally.  \n',ship
'The two sides in the Rotterdam port general cargo dispute have agreed to appoint an independent chairman, Han Lammers, to preside over future meetings, employers\' spokesman Gerard Zeebregts said.     Lammers, Queen\'s Commissioner for the province of Flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.     Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in protest at employers\' proposals for 350 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce this year.     The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on March 13 following an Amsterdam court\'s interim injunction against the redundancies on procedural grounds.     The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but Zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.     Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement in the port\'s grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a spokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in the sector, said.     The employers have written to the union asking it to reconsider its position and a meeting of union members has been called for tomorrow.  \n',ship

'Iran said U.S. Naval forces attacked two of its oil platforms in the southern Gulf on Monday afternoon, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported.     IRNA, received in Nicosia, said an informed source at the Iranian oil ministry identified the two platforms as Resalat and Reshadat, about 60 miles from Iran\'s Lavan island oil storage site.     Regional shipping sources earlier said three Iranian offshore oil sites at Sassan, Rostam and Rakhsh had been attacked at 7.00 A.M. (0300 GMT) on Monday by unidentified aircraft.     In Washington, U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said four U.S. Destroyers attacked and destroyed an Iranian oil platform about 120 miles east of Bahrain.  \n',ship
'A top Iranian military official said America\'s attack on an Iranian oil platform on Monday had involved the United States in full-scale war and Iran would avenge it with a \"crushing blow.\"     \"The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely,\" the Iranian news agency IRNA quoted the head of Iran\'s war information headquarters as saying.     The official, Kamal Kharrazi, said Washington had now become involved in what he called a full-fledged war with Iran.     It was the first official Iranian reaction to the attack by four U.S. Navy destroyers on the Reshadat oil platform.  \n',ship
'Iran warned the United States on Monday against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying it would endanger American interests.     Tehran Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said a spokesman for Iran\'s War Information Headquarters was responding \"to U.S. Officials\' remarks about taking military action against Iran.\"     The radio also quoted an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying Iran would respond decisively to any aggressive measure by the United States.     The radio said the spokesman made the statement \"following the attack on a Kuwaiti ship under the U.S. Flag and comments by American officials on carrying out retaliatory action against Iran.\"     The spokesman said, \"Any U.S. Military aggression against Iran will certainly be the beginning of an extensive clash in the Persian Gulf, and amidst this our principled policy is to confront any act which escalates tension.\"  \n',ship

There was no indication of measures being taken against the mine, which is in Iranian territorial waters.  \n',ship
'Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Goria told the cabinet on Monday he was worried about the increased tension in the Gulf, but said America\'s retaliation against Iran had been limited.     A statement issued after a cabinet meeting said Goria had been informed by the United States that it would take action against an Iranian target in the Gulf, but had not known beforehand that the action would involve an attack on an oil platform.     \"The prime minister expressed his concern over the possible consequences of increased tension in the Gulf, at the same time recognizing the limited character of the American military reaction to the attacks it has suffered in the past few days,\" the statement said.     Goria said Italy\'s own ships were far from the platform at the time of the attack and the fleet had been advised to follow events with caution.     Italy has sent eight ships, including three frigates and three minesweepers, to the Gulf to protect Italian merchant shipping there.  \n',ship

'Japan was ready to use diplomacy to help maintain the security of the Gulf, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said.     But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines of communication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to take a broad political stance. Officials of the foreign ministry said Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980.     Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financial help to patrol the waters of the Gulf. About 60 pct of Japan\'s crude oil passes through the waterway.     President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes in the Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agenda for next week\'s G-7 summit in Venice.     Reagan has approved plans for the United States to step up its naval presence in the Gulf despite congressional expressions of concern and he has called on U.S. Allies to help maintain freedom of navigation.     Japan\'s constitution prevents its armed forces from being deployed overseas. Nakasone has said that Washington understands this problem.  \n',ship
'Kuwait, a target of Iranian anger over the emirate\'s backing for Iraq in the Gulf war, today rejected charges that fishing vessels seized recently by Iran were spy boats.     \"There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranian accusation on the nature of the operations of the vessels recently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were out fishing,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.     It said Iranian Charge d\'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri was summoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with Foreign Undersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.     The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seized seven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who confessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.     It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullah waterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq\'s Faw peninsula at the head of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.     The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured Gulf Arab states saying responsibility for security and stability in the waterway was a regional matter. A U.S. Senate team was scheduled today to meet Kuwait\'s Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and the defence and oil ministers.     Today\'s Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Kuwait News Agency KUNA, said the recent detention of Kuwaiti fishing vessels by Iran was not the first.     Tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels Kuwait had sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said.     \"However, Kuwait is perplexed that this time the Iranian charges are accompanied by accusations that the vessels were undertaking espionage activities,\" it said.     Shaheen condemned the detentions and accusations, and asked Tehran to free all fishing boats and sailors held by Iran, the statement said.  \n',ship
'Kuwait, whose shipping has come under repeated attack by Iran, has the full support of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies, a senior government official said.     Cabinet spokesman Abdul-Aziz al-Otaibi, quoted by the Kuwaiti news agency KUNA yesterday, said Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah had told cabinet he had found \"complete support...At this delicate phase\" during visits to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.

'The United States said Kuwait was discussing plans to lease privately-owned U.S. tankers to transport oil through the Gulf in addition to putting some of its own vessels under American flags.     State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made the disclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the United States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in the Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reagan administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags.     The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War.     \"The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering U.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration,\" Oakley said. She emphasized, however, that \"if some charter arrangement could be worked out, it would not supplant the reflagging arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis.\"     In both cases, the ships would be eligible for U.S. Navy escort in the Gulf, she said.     The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan, administrator of the Martime Administration, as saying Kuwait has approached an American shipping company about the possibility of a charter.     Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives of the company, whose identify he did not know, that chartered vessels flying the U.S. flag \"would be protected,\" the newspaper reported.     Concerning Saudi Arabia, Oakley said \"we are moving forward in our talks ... on how we can tailor our efforts and security cooperation to facilitate our Gulf operations.\"  \n',ship
'House Speaker Jim Wright predicted passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and conservatives left the bill\'s fate in doubt.     The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan\'s decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships.     Since the administration made known its reflagging plans, congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted, and some charged the policy could lead the United States into the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.     The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.     The resolution was expected to pass without controversy today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.     Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the bill implied consent to Reagan\'s policies.  \n',ship

Free men should not cower before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand alone.\"     Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the economic summit, which will take place in Venice June 8-10.         The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising congressional concern over Reagan\'s plan to protect gulf shipping and demands that the allies do more.      These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen.     \"They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring aggression and reaffirming America\'s willingness to protect its vital interests,\" Reagan said.         In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, Reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system.     \"While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world economy is the business of every member of the world trading community,\" he said.         \"It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany, that growth-oriented domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading system on which they depend.\"     Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with allied accords on exchange rate stability.     \"Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this year\'s meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten,\" he said. \"The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action.\"  \n',ship

These are now being quoted between 12.5 and 17.5 dlrs a tonne per day, depending on shipment and destination, against recent fixings below 12 dlrs a tonne.     Charterers are considering combining contracted shipments because of inadequate space, shipping sources said, noting 13 raws cargoes are awaiting shipment from various ports.     A cargo of Thai raw sugar was reported traded at basis July New York futures less 25 points for June/July 15 shipment, traders said. But others said this was old business.  \n',ship
'The U.S. House of Representatives  approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not place any restrictions on its actions.     The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan\'s policies in the region.     The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan\'s decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships.     The legislation -- supported by Congress\' Democratic and Republican leadership as well as by the administration -- required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.     It did not, however, place any restrictions on the administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.     The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.     Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a first step toward a greater congressional involvement in formulating policy.     But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the administration to address tough policy questions in the report.  \n',ship
'The House today approved a bill requiring the Reagan administration to report to Congress on its Mideast Gulf policy but not restricting its actions.     The vote in favor was despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan\'s policies in the region.     In the Senate, a leading Republican senator, former Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Mark Hatfield of Oregon, said he would try to prevent consideration of the bill.     He said he will put a so-called \"hold\" on the bill until he finds out whether the War Powers Act applies to protecting Kuwaiti tankers.     Congressional leaders complain they were not consulted about plans to put the U.S. flag on Kuwaiti ships and some charged the policy could lead the U.S. into the Iran-Iraq war.     Conservative Republicans said increasing the U.S. military obligation in the gulf would place impossible burdens on American servicemen and equipment, and warned it could lead to war.     \"It is a real snake pit at best and a powder keg that will blow sky-high at worst,\" said Wisconsin Rep.

'American lawmakers rallied behind President Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets in the Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress debate over limits on his powers to make war.     The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf ship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.     Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans expressed support for the attack and praised it as an appropriate \"measured response.\"     But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States could erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of American forces from the waterway.     \"Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war with Iran,\" said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon, a Republican.  \n',ship
'U.S. warships attacked and destroyed an Iranian oil platform on Monday in retaliation for Friday\'s Iranian attack damaging a U.S.-flagged ship, U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said.     When asked how much was left of the oil platform, Weinberger said, \"Nothing.\"     \"There was no Iranian reaction,\" he said. \"... We consider this matter is now closed.\"     Weinberger said four U.S. destroyers attacked the platform about 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf with fire at 0700 EDT, Weinberger said.     \"We chose a platform used by the Iranians to interfere with and be a source of potential attack on convoys...,\" Weinberger said at a Pentagon briefing.      \"We know it has been used indeed, to not only launch small boat attacks on shipping but to fire on U.S. helicopters...     \"It\'s removal will contribute significantly to the safety of U.S. forces in the future,\" Weinberger said of the U.S. Navy\'s operation to escort oil tankers through the Gulf.     \"We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by Iran with stronger countermeasures,\" Weinberger said.     He said the 20 to 30 Iranian personnel on the oil platform were given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform.     \"As far as we know they did abandon the site,\" he said.     Weinberger was asked why the United States had chosen to attack an oil platform rather than Iranian Silkworm missile platforms blamed by Washington for Friday\'s attack.  \n',ship
'The United States responded to an apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would play purely a deterrent role.     \"I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that we\'re going to be assuring safety for American shipping and that that shipping is not related to the war itself,\" State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.     He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.     Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday, \"At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of an armed encounter with us.     \"We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S. Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We are determined to stand firm and will certainly win.\"     The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.     The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.     Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, \"We won\'t have any comment or response to the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not helpful or welcome.\"     Redman said he could not independently confirm reports that Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping.  \n',ship
'The leaders of a U.S. Senate team probing American defense strategy in the MidEast Gulf said they favored a multinational force to keep oil flowing through the waterway.     Sen. John Glenn and John Warner, in Kuwait as part of a Gulf Arab tour, said at a news conference that top officials in the area appeared ready to discuss extra facilities needed if the U.S. upgraded its defense role.     The Senate team next heads for the United Arab Emirates, their last stop on a fact-finding mission prompted by Reagan administration plans to let half of Kuwait\'s 22-tanker fleet fly the U.S. flag.     Glenn and Warner said the U.S., Britain and France, should explore the possibility of a unified Gulf force.     \"The American ships, the British ships, the French ships now talk to each other and all we\'ve got to do is formalize this arrangement,\" Warner said.     Glenn said a multinational force could be effectively deployed within 24 hours of a decision.     Glenn voiced a preference for a United Nations multinational force, or failing that, an American, British, French force with cooperation from the Gulf Arab states.     Warner voiced concern that the Soviet Union might use the situation in the Gulf to raise its presence. \"And, unequivocally, all GCC states we have talked with, have said that would not be in the interests of the Arabian peninsula.\"  \n',ship
'U.S. military forces in the Mideast Gulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels and occasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to \"non-belligerent\" states in the area, the Pentagon said today.     \"No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting all shipping in those waters,\" Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims said as the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase the protective U.S. military presence in the gulf.     Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq.     \"As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are under our protection with the exception, on a limited case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the region,\" Sims said.     U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that the the arms would not be used elsewhere.     He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war.     Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack.     Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11 Kuaiti tankers.

'Confronted by new hostilities involving U.S. forces in the Gulf, the U.S. Senate voted to end Republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy.     The measure, however, does not require President Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate bill. The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.     The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.

'The United States warned Iran again  that it was ready to retaliate for any further hostile military action in the Gulf as U.S. warships began escorting another tanker convoy southward from Kuwait.     U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the U.S. sought no further Gulf hostitilies but was ready to deal with any Iranian response to Monday\'s attack on an Iranian oil rig.     Several hours later, the Pentagon announced that U.S. warships had begun escorting two U.S. flag Kuwaiti tankers -- the 80,000 ton product carrier Ocean City and 46,000 ton liquified petroleum tanker Gas King -- southward from Kuwait.     The Defense Department said the 12th such convoy of U.S. flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the Gulf began at 0230 EDT under the escort by the U.S. guided missile frigate Ford.

'The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier Cumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore, a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.     He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.     Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South Wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates. Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning trading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental news due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low stocks.     Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates could convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this depended on the quality of the concentrates.     A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supply pipeline, particularly in North America, they noted.

'The United States appears to have won a transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest rates, European economists said.     But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were plunging.     West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt, according to official statements released late Monday.     Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct facility rate offered last week.     While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.      \"It\'s round one to the Americans, \" said Richard Reid, senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in London.     But Reid added, \"We shouldn\'t forget that it has taken one of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05 percentage point.\"     Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.     Six leading industrial nations agreed under February\'s Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven - the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.     The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.     Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.     \"The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits with Baker\'s wishes, then all the better,\" he said.     No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises in the U.S., Aschoff said.     Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.     Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London said \"The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn\'t won the war as the security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.\"     Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.     Economists said the United States now appeared to have agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.     Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder Washington\'s efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening on exchange markets to defend the dollar\'s value.     Deutsche Genossenschaftbank\'s Aschoff stressed West Germany\'s heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.  \n',money-fx

The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged dollar slide.     The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance Ministers in Washington last month.     But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate rise was \"not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to.\"     \"What I\'m really saying is that they should not expect us to simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow them,\" he added.  \n',money-fx

'U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker met West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl in Frankfurt on Monday, a Bonn Finance Ministry spokesman said.     After the meeting the spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be stabilised at around current levels.     The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for increasing short-term money market interest rates. He had said the rise was not in line with the spirit of the Louvre accord aimed at stabilizing the U.S. dollar last February.     The meeting had been arranged last week, the spokesman said. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue the policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to currency stability and monetary policy.

'The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1 billion marks at today\'s tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said.     Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy back securities pledged on May 6.     Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with today\'s allocation.     A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful liquidity in the banking system.     Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.     The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2 billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.     Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.     The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6 and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that range are possible, dealers said.  \n',money-fx
'The Bundesbank sees no current reason to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger tolds in a telephone interview.     Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts may once again be under discussion.     Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his two central bank council colleagues.     But he added that the last central bank council meeting on April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of \"subdued optimism,\" particularly influenced by the news brought by several state central bank presidents.     \"Much is going better than the impression gained by the public from the January figures, which have been in the meantime superseded,\" he said.     German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9 pct after they had been unchanged in December.     Bank economists said that the two together showed the economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter of 1987.     Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF meeting.     Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, \"Since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable.\"     Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no comment on the subject while negotiations were still in progress in Washington.  \n',money-fx
'Japanese trade figures are seriously challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates are the key to smoothing world trade problems.     Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan shrinking?     What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down made world trade problems worse rather than solving them, fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker\'s forecast of world trade recession?     U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five pact in New York.     The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.     Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined only 11 pct against the yen.?     Last week\'s G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?

'An income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.     Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies.     The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech. He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could be much higher than the government\'s 1.3 billion dlr forecast.     Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.     He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986, but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact. Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation.     The government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.     New Zealand\'s inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.     The major deficiency in the government\'s anti-inflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.     \"The widespread belief that (New Zealand\'s) problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based -- primarily because the government\'s macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,\" Bayliss said.  \n',money-fx

'Finance ministers from seven major industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.     In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy.     West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a \"good meeting\" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.     Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.     The communique said, \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances.\"     It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed \"extraordinary and urgent measures\" including an \"unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.\"     The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.     The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then-current levels.     In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows.     Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports.     The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate.

'International monetary officials will  rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the Louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets, economists and currency traders said.     \"I don\'t think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks up in an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the dollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.

In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to foster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.     His comments rocked the currency markets and helped send the already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into a tailspin.

'Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the market of their resolve.     At a news conference after today\'s G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed.     The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said.     He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable.     Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.     \"As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression of \'current level\' is rather vague idea,\" he said.     The yen\'s movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.     It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market, Miyazawa said.     Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable.     He also said Japan\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement.     Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7 meeting and did not affect the currency talks.

'Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany\'s central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central bank\'s independence.     But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl, president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of the country\'s already nervous financial markets, bankers said.     Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates     Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl\'s criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors.     \"The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors,\" said one economist for a London broker, who asked not to be identified.     Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.     \"There are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill feeling,\" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.     News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad.     Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.     Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under extraordinary pressures lately.     Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.     In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices.     Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his views, bankers said.     \"Poehl is in a minority in his own house,\" said Commerzbank\'s Pfister.     \"Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not entirely his own,\" said another economist.     The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far, they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark and hurting West German exporters.     The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the Bundesbank\'s new tack became clear in early October.     Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.     Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986 war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S. Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.     One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.     But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.     The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year, had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.     The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising 4.3 billion marks.     But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.     Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row which has turned into the country\'s worst political scandal.     Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last month early to sort out a row in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.     The state\'s CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after allegations of a \"dirty tricks\" election campaign led to heavy losses for the CDU in state elections.     Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.     Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.     When Poehl\'s contract came up for renewal earlier this year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl\'s CDU-led coalition government gave Poehl another eight-year term.     Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.     But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg\'s tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the Bundesbank\'s independence of government, Chrobok said.  \n',money-fx
'Remarks by central bankers raised some hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a move in the near term, money market dealers said.     Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.     Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.     Dealers said the Bundesbank\'s latest liquidity allotment this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.     The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80 pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market, as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.     But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions, and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to 3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.     The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.     Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than the more public adjustment of leading rates.     The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.     Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the 15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.     Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week. This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited with banks.     Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5 billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.     Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the estimated 51 billion required for all of April.  \n',money-fx

'If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street, Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a serious way, Japan investment managers say.     The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar securities, have already sold U.S. Equities.     But \"if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw significant funds from U.S. Shares,\" said Akira Kawakami, deputy manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd\'s international investment department.     An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese investment in U.S. Bonds. \"Japan-U.S. Interest rate differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing in the absence of dollar stability,\" said Kawakami.     U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S. Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.     But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating to see if the dollar really is stable, he said.

'Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an advisory panel to the government\'s Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said.     The advisory body said in its report that the yen would soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global basis were delayed.     An EPA official tolds the dollar could fall to slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to restructure their economies.     The dollar\'s fall without structural adjustments would cut Japan\'s current account surplus to two pct of gross national product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually during the seven-year period to 1993.     If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan\'s current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993.

'Interest rates on Kuwaiti dinar deposits held firm in scattered trading despite a Central Bank decision to revive limited funding lines, dealers said.     The Central Bank, which last Tuesday shut a daily aid window through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopened the facility for three month money, which was available at seven pct, they said.     It offered one month funds at seven pct through swap facilities, dealers said.     Today\'s Central Bank action, combined with sales of dollars by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the U.S. Currency arising from attractive U.S. Interest rates and Gulf tension, dealers said.     However, as one dealer noted: \"The market is still unsettled.\"     Overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business, traded up to 30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers down to 10 pct by the close. Tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell quotes started at 30, 20 pct, ended at 14, eight.     Spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after opening bids of 10. Dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an early 9-1/2, 7-1/2.     One month rates were at the same level after trade at eight then 8-1/2. Dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct and six-month to one year funds at seven, six pct. They reported offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and one year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close.      The Central Bank fixed its dinar exchange rate steady at 0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday\'s 0.27939/73. The spot dinar was 0.27930/40.  \n',money-fx
'The scale of foreign exchange intervention the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of Britain\'s determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.     Saying he was \"content\" with sterling\'s current value, Lawson told reporters he wanted \"to maintain the exchange rate stability we have all signed up for.\" He declined to say if he favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels.  May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.     In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.     Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, \"We have been playing a very full part ourselves\" in meeting our commitments toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.     \"We wish to see it (stability) continuing,\" he added.     Asked which techniques were available to preserve stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and interest rate changes could be used to tackle \"the market pressures there are from time to time.\"     \"Interest rate stability is not an objective in that sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times,\" he added.     Lawson said he expected intervention to be \"sterilised\" by draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new issues of government securities and foreign currency sales, when the market allowed.     This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention, he said.     \"Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs,\" Lawson said. \"I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale.\"  \n',money-fx
'The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.     Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth.?#5;&#30;side measures to boost growth, he said.      \"I think it is possible that there may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in Germany,\" he added, but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.     Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on \"a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.\"     He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced \"satisfactory exchange rate stability,\" in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and he was \"content\" with sterling\'s exchange rate.     Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May currency reserves announced today he said, \"we have been playing a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.\"     Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic commitments underlying the accord.     \"Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in Paris ... In this respect.\" He said the U.S. Budget deficit was \"very important.\"     Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson said, \"what is really needed in Japan is an increase in merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.\"     \"There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified,\" he said.     Lawson doubted that Tokyo\'s partners would indulge in \"Japan bashing\" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of Nakasone\'s plans to increase Japanese development aid over the next three years.     Japan\'s more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.     He said he thought West Germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth.     In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of German national industries.     On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to make progress in Venice.     The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.     Lawson said he would seek \"to consolidate political backing for the plan at the Venice summit\" and hoped the programme would be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.     He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt provisions.     \"First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,\" he said.     U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations, strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions. \"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,\" Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions.     He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit. \"There is a consensus, which we have to push further.\"  \n',money-fx

'Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bank president, urged the National Bank to declare its intent of achieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.     In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, \"A gradually rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with regard to sustaining Swiss industry.\"     \"Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of issue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect,\" he said.     Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss central bank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank\'s target of monetary stability.     \"Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, have to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary policy,\" he told shareholders. \"Realistically there is in fact no persuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20 pct lower than the Swiss.\"     A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and Swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over a long period of time.     The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market, not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influence individual parities separately.     Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not support the value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other central banks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.     \"I would be the last to recommend that. The key to a stronger dollar lies in the United States itself,\" Leutwiler said.  \n',money-fx
'The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations still comply with last February\'s Louvre accord to stabilize currencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.     And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\'s remarks at the weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower range for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.     \"The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on,\" the Bank of Japan official tolds.     The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he noted.     A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar against the mark or the yen.     The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between 140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.     The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and 141.35 yen.     \"Behind Baker\'s remark was U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre accord,\" the Finance Ministry official said.     He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt problem.     Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets further, the monetary officials said.     Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary expectations in the U.S.     \"That\'s why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre agreement is still operative,\" the senior ministry official said.     Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West Germany\'s increase in short-term interest rates.     The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany, try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the accord, foreign exchange dealers said.     But the market on reflection also noted Baker\'s additional statement that \"the Louvre agreement is still operative,\" and this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the dealers said.     Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in Tokyo currency markets.     The Japanese monetary officials said Baker\'s undisguised pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance, or international economic policy coordination.     The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other\'s economic policies and from time to time apply \"peer pressure\" to persuade others to change their policies to a desired course, they noted. \"Without such a basic agreement of multilateral surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German policy so openly,\" the ministry official said.     The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn\'s monetary policy should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse of the Louvre agreement, the official said.     He also said Japan has not received any specific request from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term money rates have been edging higher.     \"This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,\" he added.  \n',money-fx

Stoltenberg is due to attend a routine Bundesbank meeting on Thursday in West Berlin. He declined to forecast what, if any, policy decisions the Bundesbank might take.  \n',money-fx
'U.S. And West German reaffirmation of support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the current collapse in stock markets, London economists said.     \"There\'s going to have to be some acknowledgement that the dollar is going to be allowed to slip,\" said Richard Jeffrey of Hoare Govett. \"If not, there is going to be continued fear that when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.\"     But some economists added that Wall Street\'s crash, which dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.     \"If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street ...It\'s some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,\" said Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from other London and Tokyo analysts.     Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.     Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.     \"It would be suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their interest rates,\" he added.     Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial system.     The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.     It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of 1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said today\'s whiplash moves do not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in mind.     \"The United States has been able to live on borrowed time. If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,\" said Capel\'s Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in danger.     \"The liquidity doesn\'t disappear...All it\'s doing is disappearing from the equity markets,\" Dennis noted.     David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar, as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg\'s remarks that intervention to support currencies is still on.     Last week\'s dollar fall was partly triggered by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency stability.     But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said Morrison. \"The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong,\" he said.  \n',money-fx

'Currency futures are likely to move higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated as his replacement, currency analysts said.     Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation, analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between now and the June 8 Venice economic summit.     In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan\'s attitude to the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency, analysts said.     Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in Chicago last week that the dollar\'s recent move upward was a technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower, analysts said.         \"Disappointment of European central bankers over the appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar lower,\" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol Mackoff.     \"The international community will not like this appointment,\" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S. budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner.      Furthermore, \"that Greenspan was not named two months ago suggests that he was not the Administration\'s first choice -- and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,\" Horner said.     A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated only by concrete action as opposed to \"jawboning\" at the G-7 summit, he said.     But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may be at an impasse, analysts said.     Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the U.S. to do so, Mackoff said.     The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.     Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the dollar could be forestalled, Horner said.     However, \"the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing changes,\" Horner said.     Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of their 1987 ranges after today\'s sharp advance.     For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yen futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area.

'Analysts said they were surprised at the government\'s announcement of a forecast budget surplus for fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy statements and positive for the economy.     Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.     Analysts polled bys said the forecast budget surplus was even more positive than the most bullish analysts\' forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.     Market expectations among analysts questioned bys before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a 2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.     The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically, the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.     However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will move lower.     The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget release.     Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share market, despite an increase in the contribution of company taxation to revenue figures.     One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus announcement could push the share market up by 50 points tomorrow.     The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a continuation of existing policies, and the absence of traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively by overseas investors, another said.     But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share market, particularly multi-national companies.     The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements, through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.     Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely credible.     \"Altogether it looks good for Labour\'s election prospects,\" he said.     An election is due before the end of September.  \n',money-fx

'For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in shaping the world\'s financial destiny for the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the mark.     President of the powerful and independent West German central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year, government officials say.     (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)     But no official announcement has yet been made, raising eyebrows in West Germany\'s business community.     The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.     There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg since Kohl\'s government took office in 1982.     Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.     Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook Poehl\'s past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.     In recent months, with the mark\'s strong rise against the dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the Bundesbank\'s council, a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century.     But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.     \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told business journalists in Frankfurt recently.     Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that Poehl\'s reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.     \"Poehl\'s policy has always been a policy which does not focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external economy,\" she said.     An economist at a German bank, who declined to be identified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards money supply.\"     One of Poehl\'s great struggles recently has been to persuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. For Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies.     The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.     \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they don\'t know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round, making a speculator\'s position worthless.     Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.     A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.     He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf.     Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.     \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount if you strike at the right moment,\" he said. Bundesbank dealers are very professional and skilled. \"They\'ve burnt the fingers of many people,\" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes, the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.  \n',money-fx

'Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth.     In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here, Poehl said \"It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit.\"     He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route.     Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth.     He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament.     But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.     Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home.     \"A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth,\" he said.     Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.     But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy.     The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.     \"For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful,\" he said.     He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan\'s trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States.     Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated.     All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said.     \"This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues,\" he said.     But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar\'s value could overshoot.  \n',money-fx

'West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said today\'s meetings of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates.     Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.     But he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later today.     Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre accord, had been underestimated.     Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major trading partners.     \"There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord,\" he said. \"We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do not want to discuss that here.     Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a \"slight firming\" of the yen against the dollar.     And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar.     \"The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market,\" he said.     Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.     Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation.     \"And we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through Congress,\" he added.     Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.     \"You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy.

'Taiwan\'s central bank announced that as from today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local and foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at the end of May.     The central bank\'s statement added that the measure would be effective until the end of July.     Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend foreign exchange to importers and exporters.     Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April, according to official statistics.     Last week the central bank said that from today it would reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move was needed because of \"distortions\" in the foreign exchange market.     Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar, have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank market to avoid exchange rate losses.     Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9 billion in April.     All Taiwan\'s foreign exchange earnings must be converted into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.     In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.     Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..     Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about 22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.     Bankers said the government\'s efforts to stabilise the foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will be dropped by the end of July or early August.     Foreign exchange dealers said today\'s announcement caused jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold about 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.     Taiwan\'s stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to close at 1,803.08.  \n',money-fx
'Recent government moves to curb capital inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar against the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.     Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the U.S. Dollar.     Chang said, \"The pace of increase in our reserves is much slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable.\" He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S. Dlrs a month between January and May.     The reserves, the world\'s third largest after Japan and West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.     On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90 pct of the value of a contract.     Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to importers and exporters.     They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks registering a fall of up to 30 pct.     Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five to eight cents in May.     The bank dealers said the central bank, which had previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1 billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial demand.     They said they expected the government to keep the local dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since September 1985.     The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today, unchanged from yesterday.     Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said, \"It appears the central bank\'s move to curb the capital inflow is quite successful.\"     Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from Washington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.     Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed imports of machinery and production equipment because of exchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange rate would help boost imports, particularly from the United States.  \n',money-fx
'Tokyo\'s foreign exchange market is watching nervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.     \"The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,\" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd\'s international treasury division.     The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.     The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of 140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.     The currency\'s decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.     \"The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish sentiment after Baker\'s comments,\" said Dai-ichi\'s Tanaka. He said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.     The dollar\'s fall was also prompted by a record one-day drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.     Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest rates. Operators took Baker\'s comment to indicate impatience with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord due to their fears of increasing inflation.     Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary pressures also slow domestic demand.     West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade deficit, Tanaka said.     U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.     \"Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations coordinate dollar buying intervention,\" said Soichi Hirabayashi, deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd\'s foreign exchange department.     The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.     \"The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,\" Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low as 135 yen soon.  \n',money-fx

'The Louvre accord on currency stability, which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since last February, appeared in serious danger today as a transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to the boil, foreign exchange dealers said.     But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem between the United States and West Germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive.     U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term interest rates. \"That\'s not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,\" Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the pact.     Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S. Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.     However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.     \"The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that he\'s going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets are off in terms of currency cooperation,\" Chris Johns, currency analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.     But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine view, tellings that \"the exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on.\"     French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to respond directly to Baker\'s remarks. He called for \"a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.\"     Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British Treasury commented on the row.     But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, \"this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre Accord.\"     In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive of West Germany\'s largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S. Was still committed to the accord.     In a move which the market interpreted as a possible gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also stepped into the French money market to hold down rates, injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose close to eight pct.  \n',money-fx
'Treasury Secretary James Baker said the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy.     In remarks before the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund\'s Interim Committee, Baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.     \"But I do suggest,\" he said, \"that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts.\"     He said that indicators can serve \"as a kind of compass\" but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies.     Baker, however, said the IMF \"needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today.\"     The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.     Baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public.     \"In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF recommendations, and greater use of special consultation procedures,\" he said.     Baker emphasized that indicators were a device \"for moving beyond rhetoric to action.\"     He said they provide \"more structure to the system, and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination.\"     He said the Fund\'s procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.     \"This should be matter of priority for the executive board,\" he said.     Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative medium-term economic scenarios for countries that \"can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options.\"     He said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.     \"If we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course, then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables,\" he said.  \n',money-fx
'As official Washington sought to restore investor confidence after Monday\'s Wall Street collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.     Baker\'s weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an international accord to stabilize currency values.     Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was among those who said the treasury secretary\'s statements helped spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors think that a clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy.     Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, \"I think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I think, was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic.\" It was a dispute that should never have happened, he added.     Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he   still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.     Said one U.S. analyst of Baker\'s weekend remarks, \"His timing could not have been worse.\"     One government bond salesman in New York said, \"He actually thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack the dollar down would work. That doesn\'t show much understanding of international monetary gamesmanship.\"     However, some analysts said West Germany\'s stubborn march toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker\'s hand.     \"On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial markets), it was West German policy,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International in New York.     \"All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so making him responsible for it was a little like killing the messenger,\" he said.     After Monday\'s talks, the U.S. and West German governments made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together in Paris in February, was still in effect.     Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday\'s Wall Street crash wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.    Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about Bonn\'s refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.     He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge market for debtor country exports.     Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried that the Republican party might face next year\'s presidential election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly tarnished.     A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.     \"There\'s no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy, and it\'s important that the psychology turn around quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and eventually there\'ll be a serious price to pay economically,\" former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a television interview.     In many ways, the official response was mild.     Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat, with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting that he was \"puzzled.\"     U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments and, presumably, their political impact.     For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker\'s status in Washington will diminish because of the market fall.     Asked by reporters if somebody\'s head should roll because of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen said with some irony, \"Oh, I think it\'s much too late to be doing that...You have an administration that\'s taken the attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and --- retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can\'t do that.\"  \n',money-fx

'Commodities from gold to grains to cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of inflation and economic instability.     Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.     A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co., in New York.     The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their commitment to support its value, and despite reports of intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.     Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term direction of the currency markets.     \"Maybe they have some ideas or plans,\" said Chronowitz. \"If they do, it\'s not evident.\"     \"It looks like there\'s no cure but to let the free market take values to where they should be.     \"One way or another, we will force our major trading partners to stimulate their economies,\" as a measure to correct the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.     \"I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It\'s going to be a long and tedious process, but that\'s what\'s happening,\" he said.     The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.     At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of Dominick and Dominick.     The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton posted broad gains.     Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate export demand.     After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.     Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately higher.     Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said hogs haven\'t been making the weight gains that are normal at this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field work to market animals.  \n',money-fx
'Today\'s turmoil in the U.S. Financial markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar\'s wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.     For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar\'s decline as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.     But that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker\'s often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.     \"Volcker\'s been saying for a long time that a dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he\'s got it,\" said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.     The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short of further depreciation of the dollar.     Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid worries that the dollar\'s slide will rekindle inflation, scare away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.     The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 33 points to 2339.     Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the markets\' instability frightening. He believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"once you start the ball rolling it\'s difficult to stop.\"     \"There\'s a stark possibility that you could get a destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\"     Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and 264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.     \"We\'re still more or less on track for a hard landing... But the agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris tolds.     Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.     The stock market\'s reaction today and its sharp drop on March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.     The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.     Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar\'s latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.     Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.     Many economists believe that long-run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the massive budget deficit.     But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.     \"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding cut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston\'s Jones.     Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for American farmers, Latin American governments and others.     But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and Co, scoffed at the notion. \"It\'s ridiculous to think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar weakness,\" he said.     Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.     \"We\'re going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody cares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69 will have been greater.     He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.     But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. \"Put on your helmets,\" Giordano said.  \n',money-fx
'The dollar\'s recent signs of stability have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over, but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.     \"The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the dollar has bottomed out,\" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.     Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value against the yen and the mark as part of an officially orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.     On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks, topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.     Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far enough to ease the trade deficit\'s drag on the U.S. economy.     The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.     Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up towards 150 yen.     \"There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed out for the medium term,\" added Tom Campbell of First National Bank of Chicago.     Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan\'s larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and  more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.     The dollar was also aided by Japan\'s moves to dampen speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central bank intervention to support the dollar.     The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount since the dollar crisis of the late 1970\'s.     Discount Corp\'s McGroarty described the Fed\'s intervention volume as \"impressive\".     James O\'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive, however: \"the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and 140 yen.\"     Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York warned, \"I don\'t think the dollar has bottomed out yet.\"     Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.     Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice, which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.     President Reagan said today, \"economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this year\'s meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten.\"     \"The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action,\" he added in a speech, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.     Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package, analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the brunt of U.S. calls for further action.     Marine Midland\'s O\'Neill said, \"pressure will build up on Germany to take stimulative action like Japan.\"     Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is not having much impact on Japan\'s economy and its trade surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign portfolios, while some others have started covering those short positions, Japanese bank dealers said.  \n',money-fx
'U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker met West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl today in West Germany and agreed to support the Louvre pact, the Treasury Department said.

'Treasury Secretary James Baker said that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and have improved the prospects for a reduction in external imbalances to more sustainable levels.     In remarks before the IMF\'s policy-making Interim Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the Plaza agreement 18 months ago have \"now brought currencies within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.\"     Baker said, \"These exchange rate shifts have generally been orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of external imbalances to more sustainable levels.\"     As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances \"simply are not sustainable,\" Baker told the ministers.     He said that the Reagan administration was resisting \"strong domestic pressure\" for trade protection and was working closely with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.     \"While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist,\" he said.     Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund\'s executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund\'s compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this fall.     \"We should pay particular attention to the lack of continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed temporary,\" he said.  \n',money-fx
'Venezuela\'s cabinet approved a new exchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at 14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously, Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.     Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the measure is \"fundamental to conserving the economic and financial strength of the petroleum industry.\"      He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state oil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its problem of working capital and implement investment plans, estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when the measure would become effective.    Venezuela\'s oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.    The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more government debt bonds.                             PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust fund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed in government bonds.   According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank, the BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries by repurchasing the bonds.     PDVSA\'s contribution to the treasury last year was 44.480 billion bolivars. It foreign earnings for oil and petrochemcial sales were 8.023 billion dlrs.  \n',money-fx
'Banking authorities and police are investigating an alleged fraud by the second largest trading house in the Caracas free foreign exchange market, Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters.     The Superintendency of Banks and the Technical and Judicial Police have both begun probes of Cambio la Guiara, Azpurua said on Friday night.     Police said the owners of the firm, Mario Muggia and his brother Luigi Muggia, have left Venezuela.     Cambio la Guiara operated in part on the \"parallel market\" in which traders buy and sell dollars among themselves.     The Venezuelan central bank on June 17 suspended the licences of all 21 foreign exchange operators in the parallel market, blaming their speculation for the constant rise in the value of the U.S. Dollar here.

'Venezuela\'s central bank has ordered Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange operations with brokers based outside the country, according to a copy of a central bank telex made available tos.     The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela\'s volatile currency market.     The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez Delfino, manager of the bank\'s department of international operations.     The telex said the restriction on business with foreign brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.     In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to prop up the weakening bolivar.     But brokers said the central bank\'s move is seen as a de facto currency control. \"It is definitely a control in the sense that there\'s no longer complete freedom to operate,\" one broker here said.     \"Gradually they\'re imposing restrictions and the direction is towards complete control,\" the broker said.     The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with telephone calls.     He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume of his firm\'s transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs a day. \"It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,\" he said.     The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.     \"We weren\'t buying dollars from Venezuelans, that\'s ridiculous,\" he said. \"They\'ve been on a rampage against foreigners.\"     The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela\'s central bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct reserve requirement.     In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in bolivar futures, the broker said.     \"We used to have a forward market,\" he said. \"For a small currency it was miraculous.\"     He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S. Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free market.  \n',money-fx
'Paul Volcker\'s decision not to go for a third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about the U.S.\' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem rising inflation, financial market analysts said.     Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough campaign against inflation over the next year or two.     \"The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with inflation,\" said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for monetary and financial policy at the Fed.     \"A lot of questions have been raised by Volcker\'s departure. Until Greenspan answers them, the markets will remain nervous,\" added Stephen Slifer, money market economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.     This morning\'s announcement sent the dollar into a tailspin, which was halted only by concerted central bank intervention in the open currency market.   \n',money-fx
'South Africa must drive down its inflation rate to much lower levels to prevent a further decline in the rand, said Volkskas Bank in its monthly economic review.

'Economists said that they doubt the Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.     Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were 1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.     \"One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it probably isn\'t,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.     Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.     However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings.     \"Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn\'t quite make it,\" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.     A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.     Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.     The Fed took no market reserve management action last Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.     Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday\'s overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.     \"It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at this time,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.     Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the United States and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.     \"Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled,\" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.     He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday\'s Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.     In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in Wednesday\'s G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the United States and Japan.     The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where the rate has been since early November.     \"I\'m not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,\" said Sullivan of Dean Witter.     If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from six to 6.10 pct previously.  \n',interest

The bank\'s bill buying operation also had little impact because it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.     The money traders said they regarded the central bank\'s CD buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan\'s pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.     \"We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip any further,\" a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing market expectation of higher rates will remain.     \"If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stay above four pct for the time being,\" he said.  \n',interest
'The Bank of Japan will tomorrow sell 1,200 billion yen in bills from its holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 2,100 billion, money market traders said.     Of the total, 800 billion yen will yield 3.6004 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in 34-day repurchase agreements maturing on August 3.     The other 200 billion yen will yield 3.6003 pct in 43-day repurchase accords maturing on August 12.     The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 3.6503 pct in 50-day repurchase agreements maturing on August 19.     The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.5625 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and 3.6250 pct on two-month bills.     They attributed the projected surplus mainly to 1,900 billion yen of government tax allocations to local governments and public bodies.  \n',interest
'The Belgian National Bank said it cut one, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by 0.10 points, effective immediately.     The cuts take the one month rate to 6.75 pct, the two month rate to 6.80 pct and the key three month rate to 6.85 pct, the central bank said in a telex.     A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was made after a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and was not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct discount rate.     The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especially the three-month rate, have been the National Bank\'s main monetary policy instrument for the last two years.     The discount rate has been the market\'s penalty rate rather than a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currently little used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said.     The bank last cut one- to three-month certificate rates on June 5, also by 0.10 points.  \n',interest
'White House Budget chief James Miller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might \"overreact\" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession next year.     \"Our greatest danger is overreaction,\" Miller told newspaper reporters yesterday. \"I\'m concerned about the Fed\'s overreaction. I\'m concerned about what I see in recent data showing a substantial fall in the money supply.\"     Edwin Dale, Miller\'s spokesman, said the remarks, published in the New York Times today, were accurate.     Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he said could have \"political consequences.\"     The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential and congressional elections next year.     \"My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep soup, and there is no question about it,\" he said.     Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax revenues and a widening of the budget deficit.     Miller\'s remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of bolstering the dollar.     Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize global growth prospects.     U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist pressures in the United States.  \n',interest
'Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.     In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements.     \"Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them,\" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.     Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods, services and investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends.     Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.     \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.     The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S. Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems.     The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect.     \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term,\" Koehler said.     A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand. In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should rise faster than GNP.     \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.     If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..     But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the U.S.     When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.     Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates.     It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability, economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.     A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding of non-inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.     Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set, because they were only testing points for the market, he said.     In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.  \n',interest
'The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit, banking economists and money market dealers said.     The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future, they said.     The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.     But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and did not necessarily herald any policy moves.     Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark.     Schlesinger tolds in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office, that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.     Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.     \"They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or Lombard,\" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder, Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.     Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany.     A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand, with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.     The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve. \"The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,\" he said.     A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.     The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week\'s Venice summit.     But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere \"eyewash.\"     Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.     But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.     \"The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they can\'t risk increasing the deficit further,\" said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst\'s Hutmann.     Bethmann\'s Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. \"But I don\'t expect any convincing measures,\" he said.     Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month-end distortions.     Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15. Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.     Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55 pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.     But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not represent a tightening of policy, however.     Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.     On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.     Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French occupation this century.     But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes.  \n',interest

'Donald Regan, President Reagan\'s former chief of staff, said the government should loosen the money supply, try to keep interest rates down and try to reduce the federal budget and trade deficits to avoid a recession.     \"I think what we have to face now is trying to preserve our economy,\" the one-time chairman of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc MER said in an interview on the ABC television network.     \"We\'ve got to loosen money, we\'ve got to keep interest rates down.

'A cut of about half a percentage point in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.     Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank, encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German, might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.     Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.     That rate has remained in force, just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings.     Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff, forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.     In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota.     Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.     In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.     Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market.     Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate, provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.     The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673 guilders per 100 marks.     Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level that would not permit a change in the interest rate differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers said.     An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term.     In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil, or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts point to a falling rate of economic growth.     \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\" the ABN economist said.     He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in January, could also contribute to some inflation.     At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates, currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.     Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down, probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below five pct.     Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in the money market.  \n',interest
'Australian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets, analysts said.     High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and U.S. Investors, analysts polled bys said.     Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.     A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.     Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States.     \"These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don\'t know what to do with it. Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said.     \"There is a \'flight to quality\',\" Hamley said. \"Australia may not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren\'t too many other countries where you\'d want to put your money.\"     The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.     \"We\'re looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S. Where some people would be concerned about the value of the U.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable?\"     But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy, he said.     \"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government\'s promised tough economic statement on May 14.     While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.     \"It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be delivered, if the statement wasn\'t considered tough enough, one might see a substantial outflow,\" Buttrose said.     Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.     \"They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here,\" Buttrose said.     Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.     Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off the yen\" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.     Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen.     Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.     Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities, particularly in the gold sector.     The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3 today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the same period.     The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate, particularly in the tourism field.     Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney\'s five-star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought.     \"They think they find good value real estate here which, with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of investment Australia needs,\" Buttrose added.  \n',interest

'Remarks by two leading central bankers sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in the West German three pct discount rate may be under discussion, currency dealers said.     Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates.     Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was not making a forecast on interest rates, however.     Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation.     But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80 pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate and let the strength of banks\' demands set the allocation rate.     It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact expired.

Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.     \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity.\"     Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.^M \n',interest
'Swiss National Bank President Pierre Languetin said a wider interest rate differential between the dollar and stronger currencies was needed to brake the dollar\'s fall.     At a news conference, he said Japan and West Germany could try to stimulate their economies further by expanding money supply, but he added \"I\'m not so sure it would be desirable if monetary policy became more expansive.     \"But what would be useful is a greater differential in interest rates,\" he said.  \n',interest
'Sales of new single-family homes tumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of higher mortgage interest rates, analysts said.     \"There should be another month or two of very weak new home sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes should become more stable by mid-summer,\" said economist Lawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.     The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the Commerce Department said.     Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at about 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April, according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.     The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out of the market, he and others said.     \"The rates moved very suddenly and were certainly unexpected by homebuyers,\" said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources. \"They were so startled, they wanted to hold back and see what would happen.\"     The drop in sales of new single-family home sales was sharper than expected, some economists said. \"We fully expected a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated,\" said James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.     Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales of existing homes, which are generally less expensive than new homes.     Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of new condominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast were reflected in sales of existing but not new homes.     Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said, \"Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the market is going to stabilize and give us a good second half.\"     Others were less optimistic, however.     \"We clearly won\'t have a boom (in new home sales) but I don\'t think this is the start of a collapse in single-family housing,\" said Chimerine of Wharton.     Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, said, \"The lower sales level will be maintained for awhile until there is another change in rates. There won\'t be much specific improvement in coming months.\"  \n',interest
'Bank of Japan sources said the bank has no plans to cut its discount rate.     They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel any need for a cut at all.     Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries - those with strong currencies - might have to cut interest rates.     The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the G-7 pact a failure.     The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar\'s renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the dollar\'s fall had been orderly.     They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker\'s comments because he was referring to the dollar\'s fall since the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span, not the currency\'s recent movements.     They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other.     The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies.     Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the U.S. And world economies, they said.     In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources said.     Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.     This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and dollar/European currencies.     At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did not object to the yen strengthening, they said.  \n',interest
'Henry Kaufman, managing director of Salomon Brothers Inc, said the nomination of economist Alan Greenspan to replace Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and currency markets.     \"The basic direction of interest rates is not changed. The fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward, interrupted by intermittent rallies,\" Kaufman said in a statement. He said the implication for equity markets in neutral to bullish.     Kaufman said, \"Unlike Paul Volcker, who entered the office of the Federal Reserve chairman with strong credibility both domestically and internationally, Mr Greenspan will have to demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before he can gain full confidence of the financial markets.\"     Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the U.S. economy, while his professional skills in the international area are much more limited, Kaufman noted.     \"Consequently, although he is well known abroad, his views on issues such as the Less Developed Country Debt may initially carry less weight than have those of Mr Volcker.\"  \n',interest
'Nigel Lawson, Britain\'s Chancellor of the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.     Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said central banks would continue to intervene \"as and when necessary.\"     He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.     Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget speech to the British Parliament.     \"If anything I\'m a little bit less concerned, but there is still a risk,\" he said.     Asked if the United States should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar, he said, \"If there is a need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn\'t need to be a rise in interest rates in the United States.\"     Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday\'s meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in reducing its budget deficit.     \"We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it continue year after year,\" Lawson said.     The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.     Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the Louvre accord, he said, \"I don\'t think so. If there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.\"     Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson said, \"the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode ... but one has to be vigilant.\"     He said yesterday\'s G-7 statement, which affirmed that \"current levels\" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been \"carefully worded.\" \"We know what we mean, and we all mean the same thing,\" he said.     Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement.     Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa\'s presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand.     They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year.  \n',interest

'Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.     With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark, Schlesinger tolds that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed.     The economy is picking up, after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth, he added. \"We may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter,\" he said in an interview.     Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.     Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in 1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.     He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct.    \"It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly,\" he said, noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.     Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank\'s three to six pct target.     He said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.     \"There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed,\" Schlesinger said.     A major reason for the inflows was the market\'s conviction that the mark was headed higher. \"As we can see from the market, expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished,\" Schlesinger said.     The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.     Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87 marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.     At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.     \"Central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,\" Schelsinger said.     \"One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,\" he said, adding, \"It is not only our own case, it is also the American case.\"     He said that the West German export industry has been hit hard by the dollar\'s sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now. \"But it wouldn\'t be good to have short-term fluctuations,\" he said. \"Let us wait and see.\"     \"It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level (of rates) as such,\" Schlesinger said.     The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West German inflation down year.     Although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.     Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term, in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.     The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16 months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank\'s council, Schlesigner said.     But he added: \"I don\'t see any great pressure to go away from it.\"  \n',interest
'Rises in West German and international interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said.     \"We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,\" Poehl told an investment conference.     \"I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates,\" he said.     Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct.     Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct at last week\'s pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in late September.     The Bundesbank\'s reduction of the key allocation rate to 3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.     These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.     Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.     Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.     But the dollar rallied on news of Monday\'s meeting in nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.     Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not due to central bank policy, but to markets\' expectations, and currency developments.     Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said \"You have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears.\"  The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he said.     Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany, saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.     The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.     \"Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of 1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest rates have risen substantially more,\" Poehl said.     This had to be taken into account when considering recent rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to rising international money market rates that had spilled over into the German market, he said.     Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.     \"The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is definitely underway,\" he said, noting that this was not so noticeable in absolute figures.     The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also attracted little attention, he said.  \n',interest
'Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said West Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates and that he believed the economy would continue to recover after a six-month lull.

Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the past six months because of the mark\'s surge and the cold winter.     \"But since April, statistics clearly show that the economy finds itself on a course of growth,\" he said. \"I expect this development to continue in the coming months.\"     Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Community trade war, Poehl said such an event would be disastrous.     \"For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used by protectionist forces in the U.S. As pretexts,\" he added. \"This includes...Eliminating existing restrictions in the EC as far as possible.

'The head of Spain\'s employers\' federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried about the government\'s monetary policies because high real interest rates were hampering investment.     He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this year were not endangering the government\'s five pct inflation target. The government\'s perceived need to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.     High real interest rates were attracting an influx of speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the government\'s target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.     Spain\'s most closely-watched measure of money supply, liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17 pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.     To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from 11.8 at end-1986.     Cuevas said employers were heeding the government\'s call to hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year, with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.     These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.     He said Spain\'s current wave of strikes mainly affected the state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five pct wage ceiling.     Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in Spain\'s foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct increase over the corresponding period last year.     However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the peseta to correct the imbalance.  \n',interest
'Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues, government and private economists said.     A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.     Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise.      Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank\'s apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.     But today\'s stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15 pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.     Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market\'s collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount rate increase.     A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S. And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. \"They need to support the stock and security markets,\" he said.     But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week.     Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.     With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence, one government economist said.     \"There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won\'t be that big,\" said another.     Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own, although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year\'s economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.     Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending, one government economist said.     In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation, one central bank official said. \"That will at least take a couple of days, if not weeks,\" he said.  \n',interest
'Representatives of major U.K. Based banks are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the cost of financing British exports guaranteed by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sources said.     The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD and the Bank of England.     Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD\'s medium term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.      The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size and maturity of the credit and the currency.     The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers said that while these rates would reduce a bank\'s return they would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another cost reduction plan.     At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing government backed credit in the capital markets.      On credits that are refinanced an original lender would receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.   \n',interest
'Bank of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could jeopardise recent economic achievements in the U.K.     In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in Birmingham, he said prospective returns on real investment are more favourable, relative to those on financial assets, than for a good number of years.     \"It would surely be foolish to put that favourable conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or excessively,\" he said.     \"We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity, but at the risk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of high inflation,\" he added.     Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would argue that interest rates are still too high and deter investment in industry.     \"But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were intervening to support sterling and had some temporary difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in base rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy at the time,\" he added.

'An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as long as sterling remains in its present robust state, economists said.     An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.     \"In the normal course of events the markets would have been extremely worried about that figure,\" noted Peter Spencer, U.K. Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.     After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data, which compared won stg August rise, U.K. Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee from plummetting equities into the relative security of government securities.     Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a day\'s low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data, before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone throughout.     U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response, resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.     Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, \"With the financial markets doing what they\'re doing, that\'s the last thing the Bank of England would want to do,\" Spencer said.     \"The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,\" said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August\'s 4.5 pct growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.     But \"The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed down is a rather encouraging sign,\" noted Paul Temperton, U.K. Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August\'s 22 pct.     It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.     Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.     Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in influencing consumer behaviour, he said.     In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity markets in the past few days, \"There will almost certainly be a straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail sales,\" Temperton said.     \"Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,\" he added.     \"I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very serious panic and a flight to quality,\" Spencer said.     A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending, adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly than bank lending.     Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy personal sector borrowing.     Figures from the Banking Information Service showed personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66 billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.  \n',interest
'Today\'s U.K. Economic data have pushed the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.     A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing production data showed that the economy is still strong and does not need a fillip from lower rates.     News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually, taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist arguments against easier credit, they said.     \"The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near term,\" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.     Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday\'s mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K. Rates.     It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such optimistic economic news as May\'s record reserves rise which mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling\'s strength.     The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm about May\'s 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying average earnings in April, dealers said.     The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset the impact on domestic money supply of its current intervention.     \"The gilt market reaction was correct,\" said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.     \"That\'s very important ... It shows the economy in a very good state indeed,\" Skeoch said.     \"There\'s no reason to get worries about inflationary pressures because they\'re very subdued.\" Unit wage cost rises were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings which were potentially inflationary, he added.     \"I don\'t think these average earnings numbers are a major problem,\" agreed Chase Manhattan\'s Marshall.     But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried about the funding implications of recent intervention.     He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that the ruling Conservatives would win last week\'s election, now looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.     However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still trigger a base rate cut and that today\'s figures did not signal higher inflation this year.     \"Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As long as that continues we\'re okay,\" he added.  \n',interest
'More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates.     And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money.     The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business.     While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a few years ago.     But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders, mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts.     As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds.     \"We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,\" said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society, explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only offering variable rate mortgages.     The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more.     Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation\'s two largest building societies and by National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for new business, officials at all three institutions said.     The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans.     \"Of course they are less profitable than other (variable rate) mortgages,\" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans.     But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because, \"It was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product.\"     Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.     The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.     \"Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,\" she said, noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume.     In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets.     But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money.     Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.     Young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument.     But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably.     However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor.     For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years.  \n',interest
'Major U.S. banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.     In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to 7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.     \"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.     Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks\' cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point.     He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage points since last October until it fell below one point and triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.     \"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.     \"We\'ve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.     \"Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\" said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.     However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.     Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He said \"if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\"     Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.     In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S. interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.     Based particularly on the Fed\'s reserve management actions on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has become clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\"     Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.     That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected.     On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements.     \"The Fed\'s actions on Friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\" said Jones of Lanston.     \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have a major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point.\"     Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.     Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar.     Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year\'s end.     \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately. Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.    \n',interest
'The U.S. Treasury said its weekly auction of three-month bills produced an average rate of 5.98 pct, with a 6.08 pct rate on six-month bills.     These rates compared with averages of 5.53 pct for the three- and 5.63 pct for the six-month bills sold last week.     The bond-equivalent yield on three-month bills was 6.17 pct. Accepted bids ranges from 5.92 to 5.99 pct and 60 pct of the bids at the high, or stopout rate, were taken. For six months, the yield was 6.38 pct and the bids ranged from 5.98 pct to 6.10 pct with 48 pct of the bids accepted.     The Treasury said it received 25.99 billion dlrs of bids for the three-month bills, including 1.2 billion dlrs in non-competitive bids from the public. It accepted 6.6 billion dlrs of bids, including 2.1 billion dlrs from the Federal Reserve and 180 mln dlrs from foreign and international monetary authorities.     Some 24.7 billion dlrs in bids for six-month bills were received, including 832 mln dlrs in non-competitives. The Treasury accepted 6.6 billion dlrs, including 1.8 billion dlrs from the Fed and 1.2 billion dlrs from foreign and international authorities.     The average price for the three-month bills was 98.488 and prices ranged from 98.504 to 98.486.  The average price for the six-months bills was 96.926, and prices ranged from 96.977 to 96.916.     The average yield on the three-month bills was the highest since 5.99 pct on June 30, 1986.  The average yield on the six-month bills was the highest since 6.13 pct on June 23, 1986.  \n',interest
'Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) called on major industrial countries to make a pledge at the coming economic summit in Venice to cut interest rates.     \"I think at the summit meeting in Venice what we ought to be trying to do is to get the other major industrial nations that are involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,\" Bentsen told NBC Television\'s \"Meet the Press.\"     Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take \"billions off the debt service of the Latin countries\" and help ease protectionist pressures in the industrial countries.     Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured to revalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.     \"You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus, enormous trade surplus, and we\'ve had very little cooperation there,\" he said.     Departing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told the same television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had not fallen enough against the currencies of some countries.     \"I think that more does have to be done there in negotiations with the countries involved, the so-called NICs (newly industrialized countries),\" he said.     Darman said such negotiations with newly industrialized countries were underway privately.     Bentsen predicted Congress and the White House would agree on a fiscal 1988 budget that would raise between 18 and 22 billion dlrs in new revenues.     The Texas senator said a series of excise taxes would be considered by Congress, including an extension of the telephone tax and new levies on liquor and cigarettes.     Bentsen said he supported an oil import fee, but that it would not happen without President Reagan\'s support.     Darman called for a \"top level negotiation\" between the White House and Congress on a budget compromise that would include asset sales, some excise taxes, cuts in middle-class entitlement programs, \"a reasonable, steady rate of growth in defense\" and reform of the budget process.  \n',interest
'The Treasury Department said it notified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948 income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba.     The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasury said in a two-sentence announcement.     The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations between the United States and the Netherlands over the past eight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesman said.     The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies of Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no longer be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the spokesman said.     Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles  may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most have maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the spokesman said.     He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance at lower interest rates.     However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced with lower yields.  \n',interest

'The six basis point rise of the past month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the dollar holds firm.     \"Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis points over the last month, largely over indications that inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,\" Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities, said.     Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the longer term.     Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has become more important to the direction of debt futures than the beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.     The median trade expectations for Tuesday\'s U.S. Consumer Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down 1.5 pct, respectively.     Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money supply announced this week was \"surprising, much larger than expected,\" according to Kahan. \"Unless quickly reversed,\" such a trend \"will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,\" Kahan said.     Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which Kahan said have \"slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board annual targets,\" the consequences could be a hint of economic weakness down the road, he said.     Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently, analysts said.     September T-bonds \"are up almost six points since about May 18,\" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93 in mid-June, Duggan said.     While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far, and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted above the 93 level.     \"The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken out before this activity is anything other than a trading range market,\" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst Brian Singer said.     The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S. currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.     \"The critical variable remaining in the market is the value of the dollar,\" Kahan said.     Additional influences next week will be possible developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact and size of the U.S. budget deficit, \"although these will not be in the forefront of the market early next week,\" Kahan said.     In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results with little excitement. However, a successful auction could prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market psychology.  \n',interest

'The Kuwait Central Bank kept its window for funds to the domestic interbank deposit market shut as banks returned from a four day holiday, dealers said.     The move drove short-term interest rates sharply higher, with overnight and tomorrow-next funds more than doubling from last Wednesday and hitting 20 pct.     There were few offers in a tight market and traders scrambled for any available funds. One-month to one-year deposits were indicated one point higher at eight, seven pct but there was little activity at the longer end of the market.     Bankers see the suspension of central bank aid as a deliberate move to drive up Kuwaiti dinar interest rates and stem a flow of funds out of the country, where market nervousness is increasing over the growing tension in the Gulf.     The central bank\'s move has been combined with a steady cut in the dinar exchange rate.

'The Federal Reserve will promote lower interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth, First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.     As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without subverting national U.S. economic policy.     \"On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and, because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its part by moving rates down,\" Wojnilower said in a report.     \"Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants have seen little to fear,\" Wojnilower said.     He said last week\'s \"hiccup\" in money and currency rates and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.     Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average economic growth in the first quarter.

'Asian cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.     \"Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product,\" said a spokesman for Indonesia\'s directorate general of plantations. \"We\'re happy about our long-term future.\"     Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable for European tastes.     They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices.     London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids.     Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia\'s Cocoa Growers\' Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe.     A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.     \"When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to talk down prices,\" the spokesman said.     He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.     PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the Netherlands and Britain.     The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as \"trade politics\" and said Jakarta\'s traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports.     Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia\'s two biggest commodity producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).     Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.     This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country\'s largest cocoa growing area.     Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes this year as young trees mature.     Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries.     According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.     Some traders believe the main quality problem is with harvesting and fermentation techniques.     One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian estates.  \n',25
'Brazilian cocoa exporters are not likely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA, members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to boost world prices, trade sources said.     They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans.     \"The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in Brazil operate at their own free will,\" a trade source said.     The traders were responding to questions whether they would follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.     The sources said the Banco do Brasil\'s Foreign Trade Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment criteria.     \"The position of local producers is always to negotiate as they please.

The scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought on the current temporao harvest has pushed prices well above international levels, the sources noted.

'Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said.     The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday.     They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices.     Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon.     Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules.     The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.     \"The world\'s cocoa price at present is just not interesting,\" commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.     Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year\'s harvest.     The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the world\'s number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards.     The CPA includes the world\'s top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.     The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.  \n',25
'Traders recently returned from West Africa say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases.     One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows.     So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted, only on an intermittent basis.     They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.     The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far, noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.     London traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference price).     However, little progress has been made in that direction, and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.     The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic, traders said.     Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers, they observed.     A report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities.     In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than 21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes. Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.     Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from Friday\'s close, basis July at its high of 1,271.     It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.  \n',25
'The basic deposit on cocoa futures contracts will be reduced by 25 pct as from Friday, April 10, taking the required deposit for one 10 tonne lot to 300 stg from 400 previously, a spokesman for the International Commodity Clearing House (ICCH) said.     The deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut, to 150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously, he said.     The ICCH had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations over a period of weeks, he said, adding the market\'s basic stability had warranted a cut in deposit rates.     The decision to cut deposits was taken by the ICCH after consultation with the London Cocoa Terminal Market, the spokesman said.     The cuts were likely to attract more business to the market, he said.  \n',25
'Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with the intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa Organization\'s buffer stock manager, industry sources tolds.     \"The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost nothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be actively depressing it,\" one company spokesman said.     Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.     Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the 1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.     \"Even before he started operations, traders estimated the manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level, and yet he appears reluctant to do so,\" one manufacturer said.     \"We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply step back,\" he added.     \"The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the market because everyone is holding back from both buying and selling waiting to see what the manager will do next,\" one processor said.     \"As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is about to alter his methods,\" he added.     Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock buying for some time to come.  \n',25
'The buffer stock manager of the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) will tender for about 3,000 tonnes of cocoa beans Wednesday, June 3, the ICCO said in a statement.     It said all other conditions remain unchanged from the previous announcement.     These conditions are that offers from registered companies should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard differentials have been set in the ICCO\'s buffer stock rules, and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and spot to December arrival/delivery.     The basis position will be afloat, May/July shipment or June arrival/delivery. For later positions the appropriate carrying costs will be taken into account.     The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case of offers emanating from the origins.     The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking cocoa into store (currently 23.00 pounds sterling from \"cif landed\" and 38.00 pounds sterling from \"cif shipping weights\" to \"in store\") and the cost of carry which currently is 12.00 pounds sterling per month, the ICCO said.     No more than four offers will be considered from each offering party, it added.  \n',25
'The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock manager bought 5,000 tonnes of cocoa today for the buffer stock, traders said.     The cocoa is believed to have been entirely made up of second hand material, they added.     Such a purchase would bring cumulative buffer stock purchases to 26,000 tonnes.  \n',25

'Brazil\'s coffee exports could amount to 19 mln bags this year, because of the excellent crop estimate of 35.2 mln bags, an IBC spokesman said.     He said exports could surpass the average annual 18 mln bags mark, especially if the final harvest to be conducted in October and November confirms the crop at over 35 mln bags.     He said the average limit of errors for the official crop harvest could be set at five pct above or below the first estimates officially published today.

'A Colombia government trade official has urged the business community to aggressively diversify its activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.     Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become what he called \"mental hostages\" to coffee, traditionally Colombia\'s major export.     The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987 coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.  \n',25
'Colombia\'s coffee export registrations remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered, Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters\' association said.     \"The philosophy of the new policy is not to close registrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed,\" he tolds.     On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and May for an unlimited amount.     Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6, or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the average in recent years.     He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national coffee growers\' federation at about the same, meaning a total of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by Colombia.     \"The only change that could happen is, because of the volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations would be for June shipment, etc\" Arango said.  \n',25
'A U.S. government trade official responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.     Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.     \"There is one country which evidently still does not,\" Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.     Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.     He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical discussions with Colombian officials.     While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe, Cardenas left a \"positive letter,\" Rosenbaum said.     The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns with the technical details of the Colombian plan.     Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by European coffee roasters and traders.     Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.     The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas unless \"objective criteria\" which reflect recent changes in the coffee market are used to set export limits.  \n',25
'Colombia has opened coffee registrations for June shipment with no limit set for private exporters, as in April and May, a National Coffee Growers\' Federation official said.     Colombia has sold an average of 900,000 bags per month since the beginning of the calendar year.  \n',25

'Consumer countries should not intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas, Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said.     \"Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of producers as has been traditional,\" Dauster, a delegate at the recent coffee symposium here, told journalists. \"When consumers want to get involved, talks are much more difficult.\"     The main consumer country the United States and main producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in February.     Dauster said Brazil\'s role when the ICO meets in London in September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the hands of producer countries.     \"We have sacrificed a great deal already,\" he said. \"this year we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we are not in a position to do favours.\"  \n',25
'European coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.     Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.     The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil, the world\'s biggest coffee producer, an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement, van Horick said.     If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement, van Horick said.     Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil.     Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.     \"Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal leaves it very little to object to,\" van Horick said.     \"The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality,\" he said. \"Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone.\"     Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.     Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year\'s quota.     \"If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula, \" van Horick said.     At the same time much will depend on Brazil\'s attitude.     \"Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might just get an agreement,\" van Horick added.  \n',25

'The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, gave details of its plans to pay the 18 companies that bought 630,000 bags of robusta coffee in the London market on its behalf last September.     An IBC spokesman tolds that a 15 mln dlr loan from the Banco do Brasil would be used to pay five mln dlrs a month in June, July and August to creditors.

'The Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to submit details of past export performance in order that individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.     He tolds IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.     Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be used for calculating the export performace portion.     The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers participation and use this as a basis for allocation of individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.     He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate. Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export sales declaration form.     Auctions will not start until after the opening of export registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of the week, opening registraions from Monday.     A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the CNPC\'s export marketing committee to establish a system for allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels, the spokesman added.     A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure shipments are kept in line with the country\'s ICO quota.  \n',25

'European coffee traders and roasters may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting here this week, traders and officials tolds.     Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the world\'s biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.     \"The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil\'s attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, \" one said.     However, the European coffee trade federation meeting, which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week, has revealed gaps in the European position on re-introducing quotas.     Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing countries.     The roasters said the positions were generally fairly close, and problems with some Government officials.     Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.     Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.     \"Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present a common European Community (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,\" one trader said.     \"We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,\" one official said.     \"We have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned,\" he added.     Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.     \"Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota re-introduction, \" he said.     \"The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors,\" one trader said.     \"However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota meeting in September,\" the official said.  \n',25
'A voluntary compliance system for monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and trade sources.     \"Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and  importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other,\" one analyst said.     On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.     Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification, it will still be allowed entry.     While many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls, trade sources said.     \"Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,\" a U.S. Customs spokesman said.     \"Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when its hands are tied, it doesn\'t have the authority to demand Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to destination),\" he said.     Many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system.     \"It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement,\" said one major U.S. roaster.      \"Last time we had a gentleman\'s agreement, the trade did not act as a gentleman,\" said another analyst adding, \"without the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the producers\' hands.\"     Some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market, in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount. Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely labelled.     According to customs officials, several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations, forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans.     \"If there\'s that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions,\" said Paine Webber analyst Bernie Savaiko.     Still, others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the U.S. in the near term.     \"It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee, I don\'t think that it poses that much of a threat,\" one trader said.  \n',25
'Uganda plans to export roasted coffee to Europe by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.     A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda\'s Ministry of Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind and pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in December and the factory should be ready by next October.     He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee Marketing Board to supply his company Unipack with 24,000 tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan from the Banque Industrielle d\'Afrique Oriental in Paris.     Uganda is the world\'s fifth largest coffee producer, and expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.     Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit Uganda\'s economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln (60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the latest International Coffee Agreement.     In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be substantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.     The U.S. Is the biggest buyer of Ugandan coffee, most of which is used to produce instant coffee.  \n',25
'Uganda\'s Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has stopped offering coffee on the international market because it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.     The board suspended offerings last week but because of its urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it could sustain, the sources added.     Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the Kenyan port of Mombasa.     Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by holding up remittance of Uganda\'s hard currency earnings from coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.     The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty for such delays, it added.     Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100 billion.     The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.     The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda\'s export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.     CMB officials have forecast that because the government has restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.  \n',25

'The International Tin Council, ITC, intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent the presentation of internal Council documents as evidence.     The intervention in Shearson Lehman\'s action against the London Metal Exchange over its \"ring out\" of tin contracts in 1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which the Council is involved following the collapse of its buffer stock operations in October 1985, ITC delegates said.     The ITC\'s case is being presented by Professor Rosalyn Higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next week. Court does not sit tomorrow.     In essence the Council is claiming that its status is similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can therefore not be used in an English court of law.

Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax was adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result, they would be compensated through access to the EC for alternative exports.     \"Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannot see how this would work out in our case,\" Lim said.     Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250 mln dlrs a year.     The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPC meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.     \"Not enough research and development effort has been put in by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes such as aluminium, paper and plastics,\" Lim said.     He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an exciting possible new application.     Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the new paper was produced.     He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamental barriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new International Rubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accord into some EC languages are still being awaited.     Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia\'s behalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said it was important there should not be a long \"interregnum\" between the old agreement lapsing in October and the new one coming into force.     He described the present accord as a model for commodity agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and control over buffer stock management.  \n',25
'The Association of White Metals has decided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per 100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said.     The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for some French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals association said.     Today\'s price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and Tuesday\'s at 4,790.     The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a tin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tin trading on October 24, 1985.     The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a French franc price over the last few months to ensure it was reliable, the spokesman said.     The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railway station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.     The French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals groups various metal associations including the Association of White Metals.  \n',25
'Spot tin on the European free market was indicated in the easier range 4,200 to 4,230 stg per tonne, for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam, down 20 stg from yesterday\'s afternoon kerb close.     Stability in sterling versus the dollar continued to apply pressure to a market which is coming close to testing a psychological chart support base at 4,200 stg, traders said.     Dealers said major consumers still need to cover their May and June requirements but are holding out for even lower offers. Reported high grade tin business in London was confined to end April metal at 4,225 stg.     Small-scale spot business was reported by West German operators at 12.60 and 12.63 marks per kilo although the market was still being undercut by Chinese material, which traded at one stage down to 12.54 marks per kilo, traders said.  \n',25
'Mines and Energy Minister Subroto confirmed Indonesian support for an extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA), but said a new pact was not necessary.     Asked bys to clarify his statement on Monday in which he said the pact should be allowed to lapse, Subroto said Indonesia was ready to back extension of the ITA.     \"We can support extension of the sixth agreement,\" he said. \"But a seventh accord we believe to be unnecessary.\"     The sixth ITA will expire at the end of June unless a two-thirds majority of members vote for an extension.  \n',25
'Discussions on the possible extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA) began at the quarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) but the Council is still waiting for decisions from various member states.     A number of producer governments in particular have not decided their final position on whether the ITA should be extended for up to two years or wound down after it expires on June 30, according to delegate sources.     Earlier today European Community (EC) members decided to back an extension, with the exception of Britain, which undertook to communicate its decision to its EC partners later.     Delegates said it could be Friday before all the member countries declare their positions on the possible extension. Today\'s full Council session started shortly before 1500 GMT after the scheduled 1330 start was delayed by an EC coordination meeting.     The council reconvenes at 0930 GMT tomorrow, although delegates said the morning is likely to be taken up with minor technical matters and the main issue will probably not be discussed before the afternoon session.  \n',25
'Thailand\'s major tin exporter and producer Thailand Smelting and Refining Co (Thaisarco) said it may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because of insufficient supplies of tin concentrates from Thai mines.     Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to Thaisarco, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group RD.AS unit, to less than 20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonne average, commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard tolds.     He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to let the temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported tin lapse on June 3.     The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct this month from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lower levels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid the tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985.     Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a large portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100 tonnes per day.     As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some 3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the year ending February 1988.     Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC to allocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said.     The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however, because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a Mineral Resources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late this month, Yoot said.     The department said Thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tin during January/May compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago.  \n',25
'Britain\'s highest court has decided the International Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC documents in court actions.     On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to what extent ITC documents, whether circulated or not, are admissible as court evidence. Lawyers working in the legal tangle left from the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said this hearing is likely to last a few days.     On Wednesday the Court of Appeal will link the outstanding ITC cases that have so far reached it and a single set of hearings could begin in early January, they added.     The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will be referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies against the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988.     The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers and cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the member governments of the tin council.     Action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the ITC or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by the Court of Appeal legal schedule.  \n',25
'European free market tin traders made a somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October.     Traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin interests although European traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current \"free market\" system which has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin trading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.     There is also a view among European traders that, while the proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.     Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court litigation actions have been resolved.     Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten year low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as 4,680 stg in December 1986.     This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350 stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.     LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065 tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485 tonnes reached in February 1986.     Traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.     However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to 4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.     The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.     There was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.     Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks\' original tin holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved, and the bulk of material still available is being held by Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal.     Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the International Tin Council\'s, ITC, buffer stock manager halted support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members nations of the International Tin Agreement.     The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker Shearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin position.     Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter.     The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two major producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.  \n',25

'Homestake Mining Co is considering acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company\'s exploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger tolds in an interview.     Conger said, \"the move to consider acquisitions represents a change in the company\'s acquistions policy.\"     Conger said all of Homestake\'s current cash position of 120 mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition, Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which have not been drawn on and could be used to finance an acquisition, he said.     Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs.     Conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than last year\'s spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year\'s 9.6 pct.     Conger said he sees Homestake\'s 1987 gold production about the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.     However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year\'s 45,400 ounces due to start-up production problems.     He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400 U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.  \n',25
'The elimination of price limits on precious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange in New York appears to be having little effect on the market, analysts said.     \"There is nothing apparent from the change,\" said William O\'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc. \"The market has not approached the old price limits and trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,\" he added.     Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.     On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the two contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver futures at the end of April caused severe disruptions.     During the last week of April, silver futures traded up and down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts said.  As a result, Elders\' O\'Neill said, there was much confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.     The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.     Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.     O\'Neill said the elimination of price limits on all COMEX metals futures would add caution to trading since all contracts could move any distance.     \"This is amore realistic approach because the metals market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,\" O\'Neill said.

'Mining group Boliden AB said it had agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to exploit one of the world\'s richest deposits of the metal.     Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson tolds the Swedish group would  be responsible for the technical side of the operation and would have no control over the product itself.     He said one option under discussion for refining the gold ore would be to ship it to Boliden\'s Ronnskar copper smelter in northern Sweden.     Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it was strategically important since it increased Boliden\'s presence in Saudi Arabia.     \"Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the future,\" he said.     The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab in the west of the country and should open in the first half of 1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.

'Zimbabwe\'s beef exports to the European Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.     The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.     The outbreak in the country\'s main ranching province has already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export revenue.     \"The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of beef exports,\" one industry source said yesterday.      Commenting on EC policy, he explained, \"Depending on the seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are still awaiting their decision,\" he added, asking not to be identified.     Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.     Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.  \n',25

Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart Association guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained less than six pct fat, the NPPC said.     Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.     Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy between the study and the USDA handbook.     \"Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago, thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,\" Kline said.     The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money, evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat, moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.  \n',25
'The U.S. meat and poultry inspection programs are incapable of protecting consumers from contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and consumers charged.     \"The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated meat,\" Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.     \"The American consumer has little reason to feel confident about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him today,\" said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute.     \"Company management is less concerned about the risk to health than about raising plant output and company profits,\" Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.     Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose violations of federal law, demonstrating a \"serious breakdown in the entire inspection system.\"     Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being contaminated by \"intestines dragging in a water trough used to flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit, chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow their noses.\"     Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended the government\'s program, calling it \"one of the most respected public health programs in the world.\"     FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5 billion chicken and turkeys every year.     Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in the meat and poultry supply has increased.     He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time and much money to contain the growing problem.     Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.     The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20 years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.     \"We certainly really have not found an effective means of turning this disease around,\" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)     The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for detecting microoganisms.     But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls would cost too much.     \"Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and economical meat supply for consumers,\" Stanley Emerling, executive vice president of the National Association of Meat Purveyors, said.     Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at certain plants \"voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor legal recourse.\"     Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.  \n',25
'U.S. Agriculture Department inspectors have refused entry to parts of two lots of Australian beef because of pesticide residues, a spokeswoman for the department said.     She said USDA has notified Australia, which assured it that stricter controls would be implemented.     The Australian government had already imposed residue controls and it is believed the meat with the presticide residues was already in the pipeline before the controls were put in place, the spokeswoman said.     There have been five other cases of Australian meat which had residue levels above U.S. allowable limits this year, she said.  \n',25
'The U.S. Agriculture Department is preparing a proposal that would require all foreign meat products to be inspected at their point of arrival in the United States, a USDA official said.     Donald Houston, administrator of USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, told a House Agriculture subcommittee USDA was developing a proposed change in regulations that would put an end to the current practice of permitting foreign meat products to be unloaded at one port and inspected at another port.     Houston said the requirement would be phased in over several years to \"avoid disruptions and economic hardship.\"  \n',25
'West Virginia has been declared free of tuberculosis and brucellosis from its cattle population, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     It said a state is recognized as tuberculosis-free if no case of the disease is diagnosed for at least five years and if the state complies with the uniform methods and rules of the state-federal cooperative eradication program.     To achieve brucellosis-free status, a state\'s cattle population must remain uninfected for the previous 12 months.     There are 33 states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands, classified as free of bovine tuberculosis and 24 states, plus Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which have eradicated brucellosis. Only 20 states and the U.S. Virgin islands have eradicated both diseases, it noted.  \n',25

The company said the decision to use prebaked anode technolgy used at its Grande Baie, Quebec, and Sebree, Ky., smelters was taken primarily for cost reasons.     As a result, it said, the estimated total cost of the planned smelter will be held to 450 mln U.S. dlrs, the low end of the range estimated in mid-May, while the cost of the first phase was cut to 150 mln dlrs from the projected 175-225 mln dlrs.  \n',25

'China and Australia\'s Victoria state signed a joint venture contract for a 290 mln dlr aluminium processing plant in China that will export to South Korea, Australian officials told journalists.     China has no official direct trade or government ties with Seoul, while it maintains close links with North Korea.     China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) would have 75 pct of the equity in Bohai Aluminium Industries Ltd, the company to build the rolling mill and extrusion plant on the northeast China coast, they said.     It was China\'s largest joint venture so far, they said.     \"A joint venture opens up the potential for penetrating markets that would not otherwise be possible (for China),\" Victoria state treasurer Rob Jolly said.     An Australian diplomat said CITIC was eager to pursue South Korean markets. Indirect trade between China and Seoul is growing but is not officially publicised.     Victoria\'s Aluvic Ltd, on behalf of the state government, will hold a 25 pct equity stake in the project, which is intended as a sister plant to Victoria\'s Portland aluminium smelter. CITIC in May agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs in Portland.     The China-based joint venture would process Portland aluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domestic Chinese market as well as for export, Jolly said.     The Australian side\'s investment was limited to about 22 mln dlrs, but Aluvic would have the right to appoint key managers, he said.     Australian officials said they hoped the goodwill generated by their participation would lead to further CITIC investment in Victoria. The Chinese group enjoys a high level of independence from Peking\'s central government and has extensive overseas investments.  \n',25
'China, a major aluminium importer, will open the first phase of its biggest aluminium plant on October 1, the China Daily said.

It will turn out 4,000 tonnes in 1987, the paper said, but gave no more details.     Construction of the 510 mln yuan plant began in April 1984.

'Indonesia has increased its share in a 434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with Japan from 25 to 37 pct, Asahan Project Authority director A.R. Suhud said.     The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised its share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company, capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen in government loans to the company for an equity stake.     The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24 billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.     Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between 1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company\'s 320 billion yen debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold in dollars.     Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to about 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.     Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a year, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant, situated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan.  \n',25
'Japan\'s cabinet approved a plan to help financially-troubled aluminium ventures in Indonesia and Brazil, an official at the Ministry of International and Trade Industry (MITI) said.     Japan will invest 24 billion yen in PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium in addition to the 68.3 billion yen already invested in the company. The government and private interests will equally share the additional investment, he said.     They will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen in new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in Brazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested.     The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct, the official said.     Interest rates on loans by Japan\'s private banks to the two projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the current seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to be reached, industry sources said.     Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billion yen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32 billion yen to the company.  This will raise Indonesia\'s investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct.     The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an additional 6.5 billion yen in Albras, in which investment now totals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51 pct, the official said.     The sources said the rescue programs for the two projects were larger than earlier expected, reflecting Japan\'s desire to help develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and to stabilise sources of aluminium.     Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its aluminium demand, which totals some 1.8 mln tonnes a year, they said.  \n',25
'The London Metal Exchange (LME) has issued a note clarifying details on its new high grade aluminium contract, in response to questions from members following the announcement of the contract, due to start June 1.  All deliverable shapes of aluminium under the high grade primary aluminium contract (minimum 99.7 pct purity) will also be deliverable against the standard primary aluminium contract (min 99.5 pct), the LME said.     Sows will not constitute good delivery against the standard contract until September 1, and 99.5 pct purity sows are not good delivery and cannot be placed on LME warrant.

'China will not increase sugar imports substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints and large stocks, despite falling production and rising domestic demand, traders and the official press said.     \"Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to be extremely serious,\" the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986 plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.     The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.     The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500 tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.     The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the area under sugar was dropping.     \"Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,\" the newspaper said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane is a major problem.\"     A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian, south China\'s fourth major producer, where there was a drop in area planted.     He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.     The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667 hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only 70 from one mu of sugarbeet.     The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to 4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.     Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.     The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the official press has said.     Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.     The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.     A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986 when the central government resumed control of imports.     \"As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,\" the diplomat said.     The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly as coal had priority. \"How quickly they can move the sugar is one factor determining import levels,\" he said.     Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba, China\'s major supplier through barter trade, he said.     \"China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about 152/153 dlrs a tonne,\" he added. \"China is not a desperate buyer now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into the open market.\"     A Japanese trader said Peking\'s major concern regarding imports was price.     \"While the foreign trade situation has improved this year, foreign exchange restraints persist,\" he said.     The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five pct a year but \"a communist government is in a much better position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the foreign exchange situation demands it.\"  \n',25
'Cold and wet weather in northern, western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.     Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields.     But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth.     Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet development, Licht said.     In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal.     In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.     In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible.     In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was favourable for beet growth, Licht said.     In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.     In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union, it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.     In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development.     Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where beets are maturing very early this year.  \n',25
'Roughly half of this year\'s expected 130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground, a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the Netherlands, tolds.     Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April 23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman added.     \"It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start,\" he said.     Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the country\'s combined \"A\" and \"B\" quota of 872,000 tonnes.     This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota \"C\" sugar produced.     Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.  \n',25
'The EC Commission confirmed it granted export licences for 118,350 tonnes of current series white sugar at a maximum export rebate of 46.496 European Currency Units (ECUs) per 100 kilos.     Out of this, traders in France received 34,500 tonnes, in the U.K. 37,800, in West-Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes.  \n',25
'The outcome of today\'s European Community (EC) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict after last week\'s substantial award of 102,350 tonnes at the highest ever rebate of 46.864 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos, traders said.     Some said they believed the tonnage would probably be smaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a view on the likely restitution. Last week, the European Commission accepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators protesting about low rebates. This might be a determining factor in today\'s result, they added.  \n',25
'The maximum export rebate granted at yesterday\'s EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC Commission sources said.     The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for 118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.     Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week, the sources said.     They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from operators protesting that rebates are too low.     Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar. But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless the Commission reviews its export policy, they said.  \n',25

'Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.     Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record 501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December) crop year.     The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced 486,790 tonnes.     For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.     Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills by June 23.     Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June 23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.     The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the full amount of the grower\'s share of 1986 sugar proceeds received to-date. The balance will be paid in October.     Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of 23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.     However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of 14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane harvested by November 30, he said.     Ganilau said, \"This will be at least one month in advance of the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the end of crushing.\"     Another demand of Fiji\'s 22,000 small farmers was that an estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off. The FDB rejected this request.     Ganilau said, however, \"The bank is prepared to carefully consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of hardship on a case-by-case basis.\"     In response to a further demand that all soldiers be removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army would restrict its presence in the cane areas.     He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the commencement of harvest.     Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible, he added.  \n',25
'Four cargoes of raw sugar were sold to China yesterday via the London trade to supplement the country\'s current nearby buying programme, traders said.     The sugar was reported sold at around 160 dlrs a tonne c and f for July/August shipment or arrival in September, they said.     Some traders said recent Chinese purchases could total as much as 300,000 tonnes, but others, while agreeing a heavy volume had been taken, said an amount less than that figure was involved.     China was still believed to be in the market for more sugar, traders said.  \n',25
'The European Community (EC) is expected to award export licences at today\'s weekly tender for above 60,000 and possibly up to 100,000 tonnes of white sugar after last week\'s award for 102,350 tonnes, traders here said.     They expected a maximum rebate of between 46.40 and 46.50 Ecus per 100 kilos, compared to last week\'s 46.864.     Earlier, traders in London said the outcome of the tender was very hard to predict after last week\'s substantial award and the placing of 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention. They said they believed the tonnage would be around 60,000 but declined to give a rebate figure.  \n',25
'About 2,000 sugar cane planters marched to Port-au-Prince to protest against the closure of Haiti\'s largest sugar mill and second biggest employer.     The Haitian American Sugar Company closed on Friday because of a huge surplus of unsold sugar. The firm said Haiti has been flooded with smuggled refined and unrefined sugar from the Dominican Republic and refined U.S. Sugar from Miami.     The closure idled 3,500 factory workers and left 30,000 small cane planters with no outlet for their cane. The protesters blamed Finance Minister Lesly Delatour for the closure, saying his policies have hurt Haitian businesses.  \n',25

'New Zealand has imposed sanctions against Fiji in response to that country\'s change of status to a republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said.     The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut economic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in March. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about 10 mln dlrs a year.     Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the government had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from Suva for discussions about other possible measures.     \"We won\'t be reacting further until these discussions with the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,\" Palmer said.     The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after Colonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25. Implementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn back from declaring a republic.     Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from Commonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji\'s membership of the Commonwealth had lapsed.

'Good rains of one to four inches in the past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland\'s central coast, an Australian Sugar Producers\' Association spokesman said.     As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet season.     Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.     Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.     Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.     Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled towards the end of May, he said.     The cane crush normally runs from June to December.  \n',25
'A sugar mill which was this nation\'s second largest employer closed its doors yesterday, saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.     The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO) will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to 40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital, the company said.     \"Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane after April 10,\" the mill warned planters earlier this week.     Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.     At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound (45-kg) bags of sugar.     \"We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar. We have no money left to continue operations,\" Rigaud said.     He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.     Rigaud blamed the mill\'s problems on an order by Duvalier two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.     He said the government then began importing refined sugar at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and the provisional military-civilian government that replaced Duvalier last year continued the policy.     \"But now with all the smuggling even the state can\'t compete with smuggled Dominican refined sugar,\" Rigaud said.     HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.     It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO\'s closing at a minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.     Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. \"We\'re dead, and it\'s the government that\'s causing us to die,\" declared Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.  \n',25
'A sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumption since the start of the Kremlin\'s anti-alcohol drive indicates home brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost vodka sales, Pravda said.     The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had increased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned into two billion bottles of moonshine.     At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said, this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenues from vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree.     \"Official statistics show a reduction in consumption of vodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count home-brew,\" Pravda said.     \"The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also firmly settled into cities, where the availability of natural gas, running water and privacy has made it much easier.\"     Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol campaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a first step to improving Soviet economic performance, which had been seriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population.  \n',25

'Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introduced in the House of Representatives legislation proposed by the Reagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, a spokesman for Porter said.     The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any changes from the administration\'s proposal sent to Congress last month.     That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12 cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments, to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.     Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.  \n',25
'British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a inquiry     Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the factory\'s catchment area from harvesting, and last week\'s hurricane which blocked roads.     The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are cleared and supplies of beet build up again.     This is the first time in many years that a factory has been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.     Other factories are continuing to process beet normally, but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.     Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.     Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2 mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the spokesman said.     British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.     The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month, is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the campaign.     As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13 pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has severely restricted beet lifting.     Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet available.  \n',25

'The Paris-based Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries (CIPEC) is closely studying the current backwardation in world copper market prices but does not envisage taking corrective action at present, CIPEC sources here said.     The organisation\'s executive and marketing committees reviewed the current market situation during a series of meetings here late last week, but took no major decisions.     The sources noted that the backwardation - premium of nearby supply over forward delivery - dates back several weeks and is the longest on record.    \"It\'s unusual,\" one official said, but added CIPEC did not have any immediate recipe to remedy the situation.     The meetings featured a gathering of the 10 directors of CIPEC\'s regional copper development and promotion centres, which are based in Europe, Japan, India and Brazil.     Their main aim was to prepare the ground for the annual ministerial meeting of CIPEC, which is scheduled for Zaire in late September.

Phelps Dodge, the largest U.S. copper producer, last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals Co which makes carbon black used in rubber and tires. The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and then match earnings between copper and non-copper operations.

'Teck Corp said it was continuing talks about joining a joint copper venture at Highland Valley, British Columbia, held by affiliates Cominco Ltd CLT and Lornex Mining Corp, but did not know when negotiations would be completed.     Teck vice-president of administration John Guminski said in reply to a query that the talks had been \"ongoing for a long time.\" He declined to speculate on the outcome.     Cominco, 29.5 pct owned by a consortium led by Teck, is optimistic that the talks will soon be concluded, spokesman Don Townson tolds.     \"I think all partners are hopeful that the situation will be resolved,\" Cominco\'s Townson said.     \"We\'re optimistic that they will be concluded shortly,\" he added. Townson declined to specify when the talks might end.     Cominco and Teck\'s 22 pct-owned Lornex agreed in January 1986 to form the joint venture, merging their Highland Valley copper operations.     Cominco and Lornex share equally in control and management of the Highland Valley operations, while Cominco has a 55 pct share of production and Lornex receives 45 pct.

'The Zambian government today announced minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.     However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal, were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more sweeping reductions.     Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.     Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.     In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.     President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.     The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia\'s IMF austerity program.     Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile region to take action against shops that did not reduce their prices after today\'s deadline. Fifteen people were killed in the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the government tried to lift maize subsidies.  \n',25
'Zambia\'s copper mining industry is hoping to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a year in the next few years despite low world prices, deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry officials said.     But Zambia\'s decision to abandon last May 1 a tough International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.     Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.     \"We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due to greater availability of spares and equipment,\" a ZCCM official said.     ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.     Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes higher than the previous year and the best production achieved to date.     Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper industry in Zambia, the world\'s fifth biggest producer. Mining is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the country\'s foreign exchange earnings.     Production has also been seriously affected in recent years by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of spare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.     A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984 by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African Development Bank and the World Bank.     The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.     ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as part of the plan.     More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under the five-year restructuring plan.     Company officials said although reserves were being depleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the end of the century, though at lower levels of production.     Industry sources said ZCCM\'s projected pre-tax profit for the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being levied, a net loss is likely to be registered.     ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.     Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in 1985, ZCCM\'s profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over two to the dollar.     But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund, and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic strategy based on national resources.     ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the break with the IMF will have on the industry\'s plans.     \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare under the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, tolds.     Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM\'s export profits.     \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.     High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian industry.     Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69 cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States and under 40 cents in Chile.     The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had stopped sBending copper south through South Africa.     Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while 5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira. Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and fuel.  \n',25
'Developing countries said the European Community (EC) would breach two international agreements if it went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.     Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the exports of 26 ACP countries.     They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect trade between the two sides.     They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.     The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could raise up to two billion Ecus a year.     EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax, are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on June 15.     Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its member country exports.     \"We can\'t believe the EC would willingly take measures to undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these measures,\" Wilson said.     The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it is approved.     Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only \"as a very last resort,\" but added that the ACP is in touch with other countries which oppose the plan.     Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats.     Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast, Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.  \n',25

Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help the EC\'s budget problems and would provide some price stability for producers.     This would in turn help the market position for certain crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe output restrictions.     A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats succeeded in blocking the idea during this year\'s annual EC price fixing.     However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its proposals for a tax.     Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of bridging the gap between EC and world prices.  \n',25
'Dutch parliamentary parties have re-affirmed their support for the government\'s opposition to the proposed European Community tax on oils and fats, parliamentarians said.     A broad cross-section of members of parliament voiced their opposition to the tax during a debate in the lower house yesterday on the basis of possible retaliation from the U.S. And on the potentially damaging effect on Third World countries.     State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Rene Van Der Linden said the government was against the tax although it noted deepening EC financial difficulties.     \"It is difficult to be against the tax and against extra finance. The EC members have to make a choice,\" Van Der Linden said.     However, he denied the government had dropped its opposition to the proposed tax or altered its position.  \n',25
'A spokesman for the European Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.     Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission\'s Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days \"the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy.\"     The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.     Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0 billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community\'s \"standstill\" agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement.     The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system, he added.     Under the Commission\'s system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe said.     Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level.     He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy\'s oils and fats regime.     \"The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,\" he said.     Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.     It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.     EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements, he said.     The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax, Tanghe said.     The proposed system would not alter the EC nations\' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand, he said.     It is one of the proposal\'s objectives to maintain current import levels, he said.     Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the EC\'s cakes and meals requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system. Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.  \n',25
'European Community agriculture ministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of a two-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attempt to agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an EC Commission spokesman said.     He added that tomorrow\'s EC Official Journal will contain notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical nature which will come into effect on July 1 unless the ministers reach an accord.     The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but said they would not be the sort of \"dynamic\" moves which EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in the case of complete deadlock among farm ministers.     These moves would be taken only if tomorrow\'s meeting of ministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord, EC sources said.     Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices by seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sources said.     EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 still split over the Commission\'s proposal for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats.     In addition, West Germany said it would veto plans for cereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency system.     Earlier today, diplomats said Belgium, the current holder of the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop the plans for the controversial oils and fats tax.  \n',25
'Belgium, current holder of the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop a controversial oils and fats tax from this year\'s hotly-contested farm price package, diplomats said.     In a discussion document prepared for today\'s summit meeting of EC leaders, Belgium proposed the so-called \"stabilising mechanism\" be the subject of \"further study and consultation with the Community\'s main trading partners.\"     The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne on both imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marine oils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism.     The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row at the summit and breaking the deadlock at this year\'s farm price talks, contained the first formal reference to dropping the measure.     Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency on June 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They are supported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Spain.     Although the paper was not universally welcomed, diplomats said, the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for a further six months was certain to survive any redrafting.  \n',25
'A specially convened Franco-German meeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed to make any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that has deeply split the two former EC allies, diplomats said     The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign ministers from both countries and by French President Francois Mitterand, his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, and by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany.     The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the Community\'s worst-ever budget crisis.     \"The Germans clearly do not want to budge,\" an aide to Chirac told reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visibly angered as he the hour-long meeting.     Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the EC\'s complex \"green\" currrency system, designed to translate common EC farm prices into national currencies.     Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which West Germany is against, along with Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands.     EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the package, which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline tomorrow.     Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have injected fresh impetus into those talks.     The Commission proposed its package to save one billion dollars on the EC\'s ever-rising farm budget.     The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group, and plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987.  \n',25
'The rate of increase in world palm oil use is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000 tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke, editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.     He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that in the next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to 8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year average increase of 550,000 tonnes.      Opening stocks at the start of next October are expected to be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlier levels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.     The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnes above this season\'s available amount, Mielke said.     The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia will slow down from this year on, but that will be offset by area expansion in Indonesia, he said.     He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesian mature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, and at 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.     Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak, where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula, but where yields are lower, he said.      The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is also expected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean, cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and palm.     At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were unusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current season\'s prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago and with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.     Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start of next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by the end of next season.     The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last October and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 at the end of next season, Mielke said.     World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the course of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in soybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln tonnes or by one fifth.     Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S., for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln tonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks of 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this season.  \n',25
'The Indian State Trading Corp (STC) are reported to have taken three parcels, around 5,000 tonnes each, of palm olein at yesterday\'s weekly vegetable oil tender, traders said.     All are for August shipment at 364 dlrs a tonne cif. India passed on all other materials, they added.  \n',25
'Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO) prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree crops, told Indonesian reporters.     Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332 dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.     Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it could possibly increase its international market share.     Indonesia, the world\'s second largest producer of palm oil after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.     Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary shortage than to lose export markets.     Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500 tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank figures.  \n',25
'The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian Nainggolan said.     He tolds in a telephone interview that trading in palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.     Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil may also be introduced. But he said the question was still being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no decision on when to go ahead had been made.     The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.     \"Several factors make us move cautiously,\" Nainggolan said. \"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.\"     Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward, exchange officials said.     The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one official said a feasibility study was needed first. No decisions are likely until after Indonesia\'s elections on April 23, traders said.     Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the world\'s second largest producer of natural rubber, should expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of the exchange would help this.     Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.     He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to encourage participation.     Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start although trading in coffee has been disappointing.     Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9 mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered locally, the latest exchange report said.      Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905 tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.      Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and 44 traders.  \n',25
'The Agriculture Ministry estimates Japan\'s edible oil demand will rise 1.5 pct in calendar 1987 to 1.68 mln tonnes from 1.65 mln in 1986.     Domestic consumption will rise to 1.66 mln tonnes in 1987 from 1.64 mln in 1986, while imports will rise to 77,000 tonnes from 70,000 and exports will be unchanged at 14,000.     Edible oil supplies will total 1.75 mln tonnes in 1987 against 1.73 mln last year, including domestic output of 1.60 mln against 1.55 mln. Domestic supplies will comprise 725,000 of soybean oil (706,000 in 1986), 638,000 of rapeseed oil (609,000) and 235,000 of other origin oils (231,000).  \n',25
'The United States and India have not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the drought-stricken Asian country, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.     Lyng tolds in an interview that the two countries have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi\'s visit here this week.     \"We have been talking about the potential needs that India might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs as well as the possibilities of assistance,\" Lyng said.     \"At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. The amounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we have indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in whatever way they deem most valuable,\" he said.     There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419 of an amended 1949 law.     Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree on the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and that Washington would prefer the package include something other than donated food.     \"The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking care of themselves. India is a country that has come a long way in its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in that,\" Lyng said.     \"We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses we still have of many commodities..., would like to share in the import business the Indians do, and then we have some, as we always do, compassion for the people of India and would like to cooperate with them,\" he said.     Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officials during Gandhi\'s visit here, adding, \"I just don\'t know of anything that might be announced specifically.\"     Asked if \"the ball was in the Indians\' court,\" he said, \"Yes.\"     Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening.  \n',25
'Malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987, oil palm growers tolds.     Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes, unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms, they said.     The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysia\'s oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year.     Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry, a leading grower tolds.     The country\'s palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes against about 800,000 last March, the growers said.     The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.     The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean, is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous 21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.     In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil output peaks.     They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow, with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years.  \n',25

'Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community (EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.     \"I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the Philippines,\" Romero said in an interview.     He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position.     Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.     Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.     He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.     Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground.     Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally, but this was likely to take several years of research.     Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.     Romero said he would also visit Oxford University\'s department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether.     \"There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra,\" Romero said. \"We can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to the chemical root.\"     He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop.     \"In the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production, and I\'m not comfortable with that,\" he said.     With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.     \"To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,\" he said.     Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents, and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.     Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests.     He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to add to the production fall, drought had affected output.     \"Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing, adding more value,\" he said.     Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.     \"A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on 10,000 square metres of land. That\'s a lot of space,\" Romero said. He said the government\'s proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.     \"If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels, production and employment then it won\'t happen,\" he said.     PCA figures show about one-third of the country\'s population is dependent on the coconut industry.     Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or one-fourth of total agricultural land.  \n',25

'A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for soybeans should help boost 1987 U.S. Soybean exports to Taiwan, a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers tolds.     He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by the cabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.     The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987 soybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, he said. The previous target for 1987 was 1.81 tonnes.     Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from the U.S. And the rest from South America.     The spokesman said the increase in imports from the U.S. Is in line with government efforts to reduce Taiwan\'s trade surplus with Washington, which rose to 3.61 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year ago.     \"The tariff cut is very helpful for American suppliers (who want) to boost their exports to Taiwan,\" Steve Chen, country director of the American Soybean Association, tolds.  \n',25

The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan as saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnes against a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.     Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150 hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.

'Australia could lose valuable wheat markets through lack of availability if plantings for the coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.     \"If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its valuable markets,\" he said in a statement.     Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.     However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were facing enormous financial pressures.     He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about 16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.     If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.     \"Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat understand a decrease in production due to drought but they will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to decrease production,\" Condon said.     \"If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export income earner, governments and government authorities will need to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing viability of the wheat industry,\" he added.     Australia\'s leading wheat markets include China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.  \n',25
'Private exporters reported sales of 150,000 tonnes of barley to Saudi Arabia for delivery in the 1987/88 season, the U.S. Agriculture Deapartment said.     The 1987/88 season for barley begins today.  \n',25
'Fiji today welcomed the ending of a trade ban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of the country\'s ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressure for his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures.     The government welcomed a decision by the Australian Waterside Workers\' Federation to lift its ban on shipments to Fiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-elected government was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.     The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat, fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the union decision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of rice and wheat from an Australian port, the government said.     Shops in Nadi and Lautoka, center of the country\'s sugar industry, closed again today in support of Bavadra.     In Nadi two bomb threats forced evacuation of the Australian Westpac bank, but police said they turned out to be a hoax. Bavadra has launched a campaign of civil disobedience to press for his reinstatement.  \n',25
'Brazil has bought 75,000 tonnes of French wheat at tender, a Brazilian Wheat Board spokesman said.     He said the Board accepted offers for 25,000 tonnes of wheat from grain firm J. Souffle at 80.49 dlrs per tonne Fob for August shipment.     For September shipment, the Board bought 25,000 tonnes from Graniere at 79.32 dlrs per tonne Fob, and for October shipment it accepted 25,000 tonnes from Andre and Companie at 79.47 dlrs per tonne Fob.     The next tender, for Aug/Sept/Oct shipment, was set for June 24, the spokesman said.  \n',25
'Storage problems with Brazil\'s record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.     Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, tolds he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year\'s estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.     He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems.     Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop.     But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation\'s capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.     The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity.     Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation\'s grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space.     In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said.     Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops.     The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.  \n',25
'U.S. House and Senate budget negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending on agricultural programs, Congressional sources tolds.     The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4 billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.     The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.     The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior Congressional aides tolds.     Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find the budget savings.     Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.     House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.     But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget savings Glickman claims.     Another area where Glickman and other have said budget savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program, ARP, levels for wheat and corn.     However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30 pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.     Congressional sources said the only way to achieve significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as unfair to one commodity.     Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most likely to eventually look for budget savings are some tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.     Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion but not enough, they said.     Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.     This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.  \n',25
'Current prospects for this year\'s grain crop in Bulgaria and Romania appear less favorable than in 1986, the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s officer in Belgrade said in a field report.     The report said the assessment was based on travel in the two countries from March 30 to April 4.     It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the prolonged winter temperatures this spring.     However, in general plant development was at least three weeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied greatly by regions, the report said.     Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about 65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others varied considerably, the report said.     Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and uneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in those fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.  \n',25
'The Canadian Import Tribunal said the countervailing duty on U.S. corn imports should be cut to 30 Canadian cts a bushel from 1.10 dlrs a bushel.     In a report to the Canadian finance department, the tribunal said the duty is hurting Canadian farmers and food processors. The duty was imposed last year after the revenue department found U.S. corn production was subsidized.     It is now up to the government to decide whether to change the duty.  \n',25

The additional guarantees increase the cumulative fiscal year 1987 program for sales of U.S. agricultural products to Algeria to 469.0 mln dlrs.

'China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be 397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the New China News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesman as saying.     The harvest will be China\'s second highest in history but poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers have kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.     Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.     Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09 mln in the same 1986 period.     Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase the incentive for grain production.     China could not afford to become a major food importer, he said.     The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China\'s 1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390 mln tonnes.  \n',25
'The south China province of Guangdong is importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and other parts of China because farmers have switched from grain to more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.     The official magazine said the province\'s grain area fell to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.     Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane, bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part to supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, the magazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.     The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national farmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under other crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.     It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and low productivity make grain the least profitable farm commodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1 hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuan from cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.

A foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take the price to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen.     The paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10 southern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg.     The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11 provinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwest China has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave no more price details.     It said local authorities must inform farmers of the price increases before farmers begin planting, to encourage production of grains and oilseeds.     Chinese officials have said farmers are unwilling to grow grain because they can earn more from other crops.  \n',25
'Danish crops are up to two weeks behind normal growth levels due to the cold weather in May and June, when mean temperatures were up to four centigrade below average, the State Plant Cultivation Bureau said in a report.

'A prolonged dry spell has damaged 111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials said.     They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing conditions continued until next month.     Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry spell.     Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice), representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8 mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.     About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at 170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.     Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total thus the damage is considered negligible.     In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.      The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to 320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no reports of actual damage.  \n',25
'The European Commission was authorised to buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention stores in the second half of June, although sales into intervention normally end on April 30, Commission sources said.

The agreement guarantees access to the Spanish market for two mln tonnes of non-EC maize a year for the next four years.     The sources said the intervention price for the maize would be 201.49 Ecus a tonne.

'The U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.     The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers\' Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or end-of-season stocks.     However, the officials said the USDA\'s figure of end 1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87\'s 2.87 mln was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.     The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.     This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around 31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.     ONIC\'s first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC official said.     Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.     He said, however, that among countries to which France could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.     The USDA\'s forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in 1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature, was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.     Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.     It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares, down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.  \n',25
'Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.     They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.     However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.     Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.     There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.     Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean.     However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.     Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.     The season\'s sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln.     Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.     Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.     Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously.     This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes.     Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last season\'s 3.85 mln.     Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April.     The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.     The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season\'s 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop.     The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln.     The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86.     The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available.     Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.  \n',25

'Indonesia rejected World Bank recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as the country\'s foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5 billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.     Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks distributed today as Indonesia\'s 14 foreign donor nations met at The Hague, said, \"The general argument presented by the Bank for this free trade, open economy view is weak.\"     The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural growth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.     The Bank report said Indonesia\'s rice production had peaked and the subsidies are a waste of money.     Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers, exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.     Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the government would continue to maintain production targets for \"strategic commodities\" such as rice and sugar.     The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia\'s drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country would save money by importing the commodity.     However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.     He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry develop and because of \"over-production and price intervention in the developed nations.\"  \n',25

'Italy\'s barley crop is generally in good condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam said.     First consignments were expected to be available around mid-June.     Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia, which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop because of extreme dryness.     Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year\'s low levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.     Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national production would be around two pct higher than in the previous season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.     If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an increase of 11 pct compared to 1986.  \n',25
'The Agriculture Ministry declined comment on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.     \"We have no idea about the report and cannot comment,\" a spokesman tolds.     Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources, said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for farm talks.     The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.     Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff Control Act.     Nihon Keizai said Japan\'s plan resulted from worries about mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is justified, it said.     The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade round last September. It will take four years to negotiate.  \n',25
'Moderately active grain fixing was reported out of the U.S. But none of the business involved the significant voyages to the Continent or Japan, ship brokers said.     A steady 13.50 dlrs was paid from the U.S. Gulf to Morocco and 23.25 dlrs was paid for 27,000 long tons from the Gulf to Taiwan. A vessel carrying 13,500 long tons of bagged wheat flour from the Gulf to Aqaba received a lump sum of 472,500 dlrs.     Grain from the Great Lakes to Algeria made 28 dlrs against 27.75 paid for similar fixing towards the end of March.     Market talk suggested a Federal Commerce vessel had been booked to move grain from the Great Lakes to Morocco on Comanav account at about 22 dlrs and 15.50 had been paid for a cargo of oilseeds from British Columbia to Japan, but no confirmation was obtainable.     On the Continent, shippers agreed 19 dlrs for wheat from La Pallice to Buenaventura and 10.75 dlrs for grain from Ghent to Naples/Venice range. Elsewhere, maize from East London to Japan paid 22 dlrs.     Soviet charterers reappeared in the timecharter sector and secured a 30,000 tonner from Savona for a trans-Atlantic round trip at 4,450 dlrs daily and a 31,000 tonner from Antwerp-Hamburg for a similar voyage at 4,250 dlrs daily.  \n',25

'The Soviets have not indicated an urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng tolds.     In an exclusive interview withs, Lyng said he did not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.     \"Last year it was well into the year before we offered it. There\'s been nothing that\'s taken place to indicate to me that there\'s a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a wheat subsidy).\"     When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet summit, Lyng said, \"No, I don\'t think so. I don\'t think that.\"     The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for discussion at a summit.     \"It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions about,\" Lyng said.     \"When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was not something that would be discussed with the President of the United States. He said it\'s not presidential,\" Lyng said.     Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.     The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the long-standing agreement.     \"We\'ve had three years in a row in which the Soviets have failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union, but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that. These are some of the questions we need to discuss.\"     When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from the agreement, Lyng said, \"I don\'t know. It certainly hasn\'t been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running they\'ve (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an agreement.\"  \n',25
'Residents of central Oklahoma returned to their homes over the weekend after a week of heavy rains and severe flooding that left two dead and caused more than 20 mln dlrs in damage, officials said.     Some 900 people were evacuated from their homes during the rains and flooding last week, civil defense officials said.     Many of the shelters set up throughout the state in areas threatened by flooding, except those near the Washita and Red Rivers, closed as residents returned to their damaged homes.     Farmers who had expected a near-record wheat crop now say this year will see one of the largest losses in decades.     Gov. Henry Bellmon, who on Thursday declared a flooding emergency for central Oklahoma, was expected to ask President Reagan for federal disaster relief for the area.     In northern Texas, officials reported several tornadoes on Friday. A twister in Lubbock yesterday damaged six mobile homes and two houses. No injuries were reported.  \n',25

'The Pakistani government allowed the private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy announced to cover the next three years.     Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn.     Cotton and rice are Pakistan\'s main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and rice along with the state corporations.     He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and to enable them to compete effectively in the world market. This would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.  \n',25
'Polish farmers will receive price rises ranging from 13.4 pct for some crops to 23.3 pct for meat from July 1, the Finance and Agriculture ministries said.     The state procurement price for rape will rise 13.4 pct to 5,500 zloties per quintal, while wheat and rye will go up an average 18.2 pct to 3,100 and 2,400 zloties per quintal. Pork will rise by 18.8 pct and beef 23.3 pct.     The ministries said the new prices aimed to ensure farmers\' profits and meet higher living costs.

'Widespread, soaking rains aided crop development across the province, with the northwest crop producing region receiving the most precipitation, according to the Manitoba Agriculture weekly crop report.     The rains replenished formerly low soil moisture reserves, with reserves in all areas now rated good, the report said.     Plantings were virtually complete across the province and germination was well advanced. However, some fields still showed spotty stands.     Cereal crops in the southwest were 90 pct germinated, with some fields already in the subsequent tillering stage, it said. Oilseeds in the northwest region were about 80 pct emerged in many areas, with other regions 50 to 70 pct emerged.  \n',25
'Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier this month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week, according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather Inc.     \"There is going to be more rain for the next two, three days,\" he said. \"We\'re in a fairly wet pattern with normal to above normal moisture this week.\"     Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.     Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.     Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.     \"Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a pretty good rain,\" Mohler said.     Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off 19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.     Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage in early July, he said.  \n',25

'The Senate Agriculture Committee was expected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments in county loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn and wheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said.     A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan rate differentials to no more than one pct per year from the national average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.     The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary to increase the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by \"an appropriate amount to generate savings\" if projected corn stocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.     Leahy\'s proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat set aside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels.  \n',25
'Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S. farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they approve of the proposal.     The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.     Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings examining farm programs.     Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his \"Family Farm Act.\"     -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income and reduce government spending on agriculture.     -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would increase overall revenue from exports.     This would be done by seeking agreement among major exporting countries including the European Community on market sharing at agreed high prices.     Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing that such a grain export cartel is not workable.     -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices stem more from \"gouging\" by food processing companies than from high farm product prices.     Harkin cited what he termed \"excessive\" net returns on equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J. Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct Quaker Oats.     -- Harkin said a \"legitimate\" concern about his bill would be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.     He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp. grain stocks for three years.     Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a \"predictable and stable\" grain price, he said.     -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm participation would be no more \"mandatory\" than the current farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect farm income.  \n',25

'South Korea\'s purchase of about 2.4 mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to double last year\'s total -- indicates that imports from the United States, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic jump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season (Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln tonnes from the United States.     During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.     Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn in light of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies from China, Argentina and South Africa, it said.  \n',25
'Recent announcements from Moscow of next year\'s grain production targets indicate that the Soviets are estimating this year\'s grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes, Agriculture Department analysts said.     USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987 grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.     Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday, putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be \"25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.\"     \"This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213 mln tonne (grain) crop,\" the analyst said.         In calculating Moscow\'s crop estimate, USDA used the 235 mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure published in a Soviet economic journal this month.     USDA\'s production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.     Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.     While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be as good or better than last year\'s 210 mln tonne harvest.     A member of Nikonov\'s party commented that although 230 mln tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.  \n',25

'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.     Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry\'s Economic Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help Japan as well as the United States.     The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.     However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was already the world\'s largest grain importer.     Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food requirements in 1985.     Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on beef, citrus products and rice.     Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice because potential production is higher than domestic demand.     The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of rising production by exporting countries, he added.     Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product output with expensive programs, Maki said.

'After a highly favorable reception of a trial batch of bread baked from 300 lbs of U.S. wheat flour last February, the Senegalese appear ready to take delivery of a first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed U.S. wheat, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, the department noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat under the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local opposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been delaying deliveries.     As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers and convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.     The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegal remain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market that had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly French wheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.   \n',25
'The U.S. Agriculture Department has lowered its ASCS terminal prices for low protein hard red winter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, a senior USDA official said.     USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas City and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy administrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, said.     The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.     In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to be identified said.     The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago, Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at Pacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.     The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon last week and will be effective today, he said.     Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat prices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein premium would remain unchanged.  \n',25
'U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mln tonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the prior week, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.

Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell 31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.     Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400 tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700 tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the Department said.

'The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last week\'s increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said.     Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died.     That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the government\'s subsidy bill.     However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF.     \"There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people,\" a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.  \n',25
'The American Soybean Association (ASA) denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not remedy the situation.     ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored Outlook 87 conference: \"It will be filed unless the EC takes drastic and immediate steps.\"     \"These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal, since they were established after the zero soybean duty was established in 1962,\" he said.     The ASA\'s unfair trade petition against the EC would ask for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to make the regime non-discriminatory.     The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production has risen dramatically since then.     The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world market levels and is considering implementing a controversial oils and fats tax.     The subsidies \"are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,\" Adams said.     The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.     U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of EC policies, Adams added.     Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973 when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.  \n',25
'Based on field travel in the Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.     The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazil\'s total soybean crop.     It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.     However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the report said.     The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems, the report said.     Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are expected to be above average, it said.     Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested.     During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the report said.     New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests.  \n',25

'The Reserve Bank of India said it was tightening its credit policy for commercial banks by raising their cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct to 10 pct, effective from October 24.     The move, announced last weekend, is part of the bank\'s policy for the second half of fiscal 1987/88 ending March and is aimed at curbing excess bank liquidity.     The central bank also put selective controls on bank advances to the oilseeds, vegetable oils and foodgrains trades.     \"The policy\'s main objective is to fully meet the credit requirements of agriculture, industry and exports, while preventing excessive monetary expansion,\" bank Governor R.N. Malhotra told an earlier meeting of chief executives of banks.     Malhotra said the rate of monetary expansion must be kept under control in the second half of the current financial year.     Bank deposits rose 75.40 billion rupees in the first six months of fiscal 1987/88 against 66.92 billion in the same period last year, according to the bank.     Bankers said the bank\'s move to raise the cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct will mean impounding about five billion rupees from the banking system. Banks\' total deposits are estimated at around 1,000 billion rupees.     They said banks are under pressure because of low returns on commercial lending and investments in government securities.     \"Already many banks are finding it difficult to maintain their statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios and are resorting to heavy inter-bank borrowings,\" said one banker.  \n',25

'Nearby months in soybean and soymeal futures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply of livestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep the new crop outlook bearish, traders said.     \"A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,\" one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.     Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a Decatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid another two cents today to 10 over July futures.     Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light, with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing to sell, dealers said.     Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief that even if futures rally back to last month\'s highs, country movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half of the Midwest.     Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the spot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.     Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal has already moved to a premium over the August through October months and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may also move to a July premium later this month, they added.  \n',25

'The U.S. is drafting options including possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over the differential between soybean and product  taxes which Buenos Aires levies on exports.     The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S. officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina\'s differential export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in competition with the U.S.     \"Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict (Argentine) access to our market,\" said one U.S. source.         The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to end the differential.     But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88 year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.     Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not narrow the differential further for 1987/88.     As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.     A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan administration soon, they said.  \n',25

'A proposal to require imported tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.     The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a 10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers\' hopes the plan would be adopted this year.     A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.     Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an amendment to a farm spending reduction package.     \"I don\'t see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving American consumers the information they need,\" he said.     Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.     The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.     But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal \"blatantly discriminates\" against imports, would be impossible to defend under international trade law and would harm relations with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.     Yeutter\'s letter also said Americans derive most of their saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively little from tropical oils.     The committee voted largely along party lines, with three Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.  \n',25

It added that revenues would have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.     Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly due to its life insurance business.     Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and higher personal risks.     Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.     In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change in accounting for U.S. Annuities.     AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal investment influences that it should be accounted differently from the more traditional insurances.     This change in accounting practice and another change to account for profits made on fixed interest investments, resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln guilders.     AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The Hague.     In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.     Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these costs and made only a small contribution to the group\'s profits.     AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill for Monumental Corp.     AEGON\'s net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December 1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.   \n',26

'Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZA.S said it will make a one-for-two bonus issue from its asset revaluation reserve to shareholders registered June 2.     The proposed bonus and an increase in authorised capital to one billion one-dlr par shares from 600 mln will be put to shareholders for approval at an extraordinary general meeting on May 26, the ANZ said in a statement.     The issue will absorb about 230 mln dlrs of the 260.9 mln standing in the asset revaluation reserve, it said.     The bank said that by lowering the dividend rate it expects to maintain the value of dividend payout on the enlarged capital at about the level of its last full year ended September 30. The group paid 31 cents a share and 133.1 mln dlrs in all for that year.     Shareholders will also be asked to approve changes in the bank\'s articles of association to allow it to offer shares in lieu of the interim dividend at a discount of five pct to the market price.     The group is the latest to announce a tax-free bonus issue ahead of dividend imputation, effective July 1.  \n',26

'Credit Commercial de France CCFP.PA reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln francs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its denationalisation around the end of this month.     Official sources said the bank, France\'s sixth largest in terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,  planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.     Previously one of France\'s biggest private banks, it was nationalised by the Socialists in 1982.     The sources said it was too early to give details of the planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a likely date for the flotation launch.     So far 30 pct of the group\'s capital, currently at 10.33 mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to ten shareholders before the flotation.     The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday. \"The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,\" CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre tolds.

'Citibank A/S CCI.N, the Norwegian subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.     Citibank\'s Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad tolds, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic slump in Norway following last year\'s plunge in oil prices.     Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in Norway since 1985.     Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway\'s second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would make profit this year.     Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank\'s CMB.N subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.  \n',26

'Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration.     Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.     Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe\'s leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986, said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.     The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S., Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe, where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.     Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.     Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery El Aguila S.A. to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.     Heineken\'s Spanish activities should start yielding profit next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.     Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed West German market -- Europe\'s biggest beer market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important point,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.     \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German market, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very regionalized.      Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term.      He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.     Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total 1986 sales.     On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities.     To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which had sold successfully, Coebergh said.     Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.     Chairman Heineken said the company\'s seven year efforts to penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.

Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedison\'s Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said.     Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.     The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division.     In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in 1986, Montedison said.     Montedison said it named Ettore dell\'Isola to the newly created position of president of Agrimont.

'National Westminster Bank USA said higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported a year earlier.     The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.     Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with 91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.     Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0 mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.     Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.     The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced by about 4.9 mln dlrs.

'Exchanges and telecommunications authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free dissemination of information to the investment and banking communities,s Holdings Plc RTRS.L chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said.

Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests.     In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses.     He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors.     \"Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries.

'Texaco Inc TX said its decision to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code will not affect the majority of its businesses.     It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its 32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property, plant and equipment, were free of the action.     Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are affected, it said.     But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.     Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL.     Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985 judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil\'s 1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp GTY. The bond almost matches the damages awarded against Texaco.     Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin to attach its assets to secure the judgment.     Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut Texaco\'s bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to the Texas courts.     Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all Texaco\'s obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of the Pennzoil lawsuit.     \"Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond issue and the larger dispute failed,\" James Kinnear, Texaco\'s president and chief executive officer, told reporters.     Kinnear said Pennzoil\'s disclosure in court papers on Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.     Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not sell any assets, Kinnear said.     Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under 11.1 billion dlrs, he added.     Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for bankruptcy.     He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a confidentiality agreement between the two companies. \"Texaco told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go to bankruptcy court,\" Jamail said.     Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco\'s assets were ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.  \n',26

'Volkswagen AG VOWG.F, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud.     A spokesman said VW\'s supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards.     VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair.

It also said it recommend an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares, which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.     VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5 billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985, since the new capital was in preference shares.     The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly less than three billion marks.  \n',26

Atlas, the Philippines\' biggest copper producer, said it had been hit by depressed world copper prices. It reported a net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986, compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.

'Borg-Warner BOR Corp, facing an unwanted offer from GAF Corp GAF, agreed to a 4.23 billion dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc.     Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the new company, AV Holdings Corp, will begin a 48.50 dlr per share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of Borg-Warner common stock.     The offer will be followed by a merger in which each remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and 54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated discount debentures.     As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said members of management do not plan to participate in the transaction, but they will retain their positions with the company.     A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner\'s shares.     GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.     Borg-Warner\'s spokeswoman said the company still plans to sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.     Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.     In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.     James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, said, \"We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its strong presence in the Chicago community.\"     Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer, which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing arrangements.     The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or 51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.     Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.     Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the financing required to complete the transaction.     The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying cash interest after five years.     The debentures will be redeemable at the company\'s option for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at 102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.     The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before maturity.     Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50 dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.     The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right, effective immediately.  \n',26

'CSR Ltd CSRA.S intends to proceed with its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd MNRA.S despite the counter-bid from Equiticorp Tasman Ltd (ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert tolds.     ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier\'s issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative. This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR\'s proposed bid.     The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.      Herbert said Britain\'s Redland Plc RDLD.L, which holds just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and had told CSR it is not a seller.     He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.     The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.     CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.      ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond describing it as a long term investment.     ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is a leader in building materials, Herbert said.     \"We fit better with Monier,\" he said.     CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves into energy several years ago.     Asked what he thought ETL\'s bid sought to achieve, Herbert said: \"I\'m puzzled as to what Hawkins\' strategy is. One has to wonder if Monier is the main target.\"      Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.     Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.     The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.     Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.      ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the negotiations foundered on the price.     Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not think ETL\'s intervention would flush out a full Redland bid although Monier\'s ultimate fate rests in its hands.     \"Redland is still in the driving seat,\" said Tim Cohen of Ord Minnett Ltd, adding that Redland would be happier having CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.     Monier\'s independent directors have recommended ETL\'s bid.   \n',26

'Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd said in a statement it is making a tender offer for 22 pct of Kwik Save Discount Group Plc KWIK.L of Britain for a total 146.6 mln stg.     Dairy Farm said it will offer to buy up to 32.58 mln Kwik Save shares at 4.50 stg each.     The offer will bring Dairy Farm\'s stake in Kwik Save to 25 pct from the present 3.5 pct, or 5.25 mln shares.     The offer, which will begin on Monday and ends June 30, requires that the shares tendered will bring its stake to at least 15 pct.     Dairy Farm said it will finance the acquisition by placing 89 mln shares with affiliate Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd JARS.HK at 5.10 H.K. Dlrs each for a total of 454 mln dlrs.     The placement will raise Jardine Strategic\'s stake in Dairy Farm to 39.75 pct from the current 35.3 pct.     It said the Kwik Save purchase will also be financed with a loan from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp HKBH.HK. It did not give the size of the loan but it said it would raise its net bank borrowings to a maximum of 2.2 billion H.K. Dlrs.     Dairy Farm said it would reduce its bank borrowings by the proceeds from the previously announced sale of its office building in Sydney for 625 mln dlrs.     It will consider raising additional capital, most probably through a placement of convertible preference shares in the Euromarket, it added.     Company chairman Simon Keswick said the U.K. Market \"offers attractive opportunities for competitively priced food retailers\" and that \"a strategic investment in Kwik Save offers the best vehicle to pursue those opportunities.\"  \n',26

'French industrial gas group Duffour et Igon has decided to back the takeover bid by Swedish industrial gases group Aga AB AGA.ST, ending a lengthy battle between rival bidders from France, Spain and West Germany, Duffour et Igon Chairman Jean Igon said.     The board agreed late last night to back the Aga bid and advise its shareholders to accept the Swedish group\'s latest offer of 4,410 francs per share, he tolds.     The other main bidders were Union Carbide Corp\'s UK. French subsidiary Union Carbide France and West Germany\'s Linde AG LING.F.     Aga topped rival bids for the gases distribution group in May by raising its offer to 4,410 francs from 4,000 francs.     This was accepted by Spain\'s Carburos Metalicos SA which sold Aga six pct of Duffour et Igon\'s stock and the right of first refusal on the remaining nine pct of stock it holds. It also won over the French Midi-Pyrenees development authority which agreed to sell Aga its 20 pct stake in Duffour et Igon.     Under Aga\'s offer, shareholders can either accept a cash bid or exchange one share in Duffour et Igon for one bond of a nominal value of 4,410 francs with a 10 pct coupon issue by Aga France SA. The bond issue is guaranteed by the parent Aga AB.     The takeover battle for the Toulouse-based company, which controls eight pct of the French industrial gas distribution market, began on April 2 with an offer of 2,100 francs per share from Union Carbide France UK.     Aga\'s offer, which puts a price of 587 mln francs on the company, closes on June 24 and the results will be announced on July 21.     Duffour et Igon shares were quoted yesterday at 4,410 francs, with no buyers, after a series of suspensions during the takeover tussle. They traded at 856 francs on January 9 before the first suspension.  \n',26
'Japan\'s little-known Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with, political analysts said.     MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S. And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians, they said.     \"The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,\" said one diplomatic source.     \"They are a potent political force,\" the diplomatic source said.     But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts said.     \"The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized,\" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida. \"Suddenly they\'re standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense, they\'re at a loss (as to) how to face the situation.\"     Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain\'s Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan\'s lucrative overseas telephone business.     The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now monopolizes the business.     It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists.     The ministry\'s stance has outraged both London, which has threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan\'s failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market.     Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan\'s car telephone and satellite communications market.     Much of MPT\'s new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates.     \"What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place,\" said James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc.     A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPT\'s authority, analysts said.     \"With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto legal framework,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell Whitten.     Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT\'s influence, the analysts said.     \"Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance of MPT,\" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group, he added.     The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System, analysts said.     MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal Savings System\'s ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks, they said.     Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT\'s obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized the ministry as feudal.     Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.     But many of the ministry\'s actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain, several analysts said.     \"The United States is really the odd man out,\" Abegglen said. \"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable view,\" he said.  \n',26
'Elders IXL Ltd ELXA.S says it is happy to leave preferences shares of brewer Carling O\'Keefe Ltd outstanding after an undisclosed bidder made an offer to acquire all of Carling\'s outstanding preferred stock.     Elders, which owns 100 pct of Carling\'s outstanding common shares, previously proposed to redeem the 433,745 Carling series A preferred shares at 33.50 Canadian dlrs each and redeem the 386,662 series B preferreds at 40 dlrs a share.     The series A and B preferred shares carry no vote while dividends are paid.         Elders says neither it nor Carling knows the identity of the bidder for Carling\'s preferred shares.     On May 29, the bidder offered to acquire the Carling preferred for 36 dlrs for each series A and 40.50 dlrs for each series B share.     Elders said leaving the Carling preferred shares outstanding will not affect ongoing plans of the company.     Series B preferred shareholders had previously rejected Carling\'s proposal to redeem the shares and a series A preferred shareholders meeting was adjourned to June 12.  \n',26

'Entertainment Marketing Inc EM said it has made an offer to the board of Crazy Eddie Inc to acquire all outstanding shares of Crazy Eddie Inc for eight dlrs a share in cash.     Entertainment said the offer would be conducted through a negotiated merger with a new corporation to be formed by Entertainment Marketing.     Entertaiment said it has requested an early meeting with Crazy Eddie Inc\'s board and that it has committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase of the shares including those already purchased.         The company also said it has retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to assist in raising the balance of the financing.     According to Entertainment, its company and its chairman own about 4.3 pct of Crazy Eddie\'s currently outstanding shares.

'A quickly growing Texas-based distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs for Crazy Eddie Inc crzy, the leading New York City electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its founder has bid.     The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc em for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.     Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer electronics, the nation\'s biggest, at a time the fortunes of electronics retailers have sagged.     The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.     \"I have mixed feelings,\" said analyst Dennis Telzrow of Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. \"On the one hand it\'s probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?\"     \"It\'s a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,\" said analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a Minneapolis brokerage. \"Electronics retailing is very management concentrated; they\'d want to keep Crazy Eddie\'s management in place.\"     Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie\'s 31.3 million shares, it may be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its 7-dlr-a-share offer.     Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high 4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share in over-the- counter trading.      Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie\'s shares.     A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company\'s board has taken no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He would not comment on the new offer.     Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to consumers by cable television.     In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to 87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.     Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer, Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to assist in financing the balance.     Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same amount.     Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday to 9.50.  \n',26

'Equiticorp Tasman Ltd (ETL) said it will offer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of Monier Ltd MNRA.S, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a share bid by CSR Ltd CSRA.S.     Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.     As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by Friday.     It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as foreign because of its New Zealand base.     The ETL cash offer values Monier\'s issued capital of 156.28 mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.     Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.     ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.     ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the shareholding in Monier was a long term investment.     ETL and its Feltex International Ltd associate have targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion and Monier fits well with this aim, he added.     Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.     He also said Monier will not now proceed with the one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.     As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex put and call option deal with Monier\'s major shareholder, Redland Plc RDLD.L, which gives Redland the choice of accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to 50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.     CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland taking the second option, resulting in the two companies running Monier as a joint venture.     CSR officials have also said they had no intention of raising the company\'s bid for Monier after ETL\'s intervention became public last week.  \n',26

'The French government\'s privatisation program, which began late last year, has earned the French State about 52 billion francs to date, the Finance Ministry said.     Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revenues raised from the privatisation program would be used in priority to pay off public debt, which stood at 398.2 billion at the end of 1986.     The Ministry said in a communique that the returns included banking group Societe Generale SGEN.PA, which began its two-week public flotation last Monday.     The government has carried out eight flotations, as well as the private sale of telephone group Cie Generale de Constructions Telephoniques (CGCT) since its denationalisation scheme began last December with the sell-off of glass makers Saint-Gobain SGEP.PA, it added.

Other companies to be sold to the private sector in the near future are television network TF-1 later this month and banking group Cie Financiere de Suez FSPP.PA in the autumn.

'The investor group that has agreed to buy Computerland Corp will likely take the leading personal computer retailer public or sell it to other investors, industry analysts said.     \"Now\'s a good time,\" said Joe Levy of International Data Corp. \"The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is on the way up again,\" he said.     Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.     Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder, William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the transaction.     Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150 mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.     Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be reached for comment.     E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel Inc MAT and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.    Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like Businessland Inc BUSL.O and Tandy Corp\'s TAN Radio Shack stores. \"The name of the game now is outbound sales forces, customer service and customer support,\" said Levy of International Data.      Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up managment control of the company in 1985.     Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive officer, revamped the company\'s royalty plan, which help quell much of the franchisee dissent.      \n',26

'The Justice Department said it asked the government to proceed cautiously on a plan allowing the nation\'s two largest intercity bus companies to merge their operations, a move one of the firms said may derail the deal.     Justice\'s opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger plan.     Greyhound officials tolds late today the company hoped for ICC action on the merger by tomorrow.     \"Greyhound Lines will go forward with the transaction only if it is permitted to assume immediate, unconditional control of Trailways\' operations and to integrate them with its operations,\" Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC, the federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers of interstate bus companies.     But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn down Greyhound\'s request to begin operating Trailways immediately.     \"The department has just begun to receive relevant information on Trailways\' financial condition and is in the process of assessing the correctness of the company\'s allegations,\" acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule said in comments submitted to the ICC.     Greyhound announced June 19 that it wanted the ICC to let it begin operating Trailways immediately while continuing to evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems.     Greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of Trailways\' terminals, buses and garages.     The two companies said in papers filed with the ICC that Trailways \"could collapse in a matter of days.\"     They said Trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs, with another six mln dlrs due June 30.

'President Reagan\'s nominee as top policeman for the nation\'s securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets.     David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.     If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.     The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.     The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing.     The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street\'s most successful stock speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading.     But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in  securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some U.S. securities markets.     At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.     And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.     Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the SEC\'s ability to enforce U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.     Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies, eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency\'s review of hostile corporate takeovers.     Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.     In line with the views of other top administration officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations.     The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency\'s enforcement agenda during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.     Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission\'s current priorities.     The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.     The agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies, investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.     The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency, meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone.     By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the White House.     Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms.     The agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities.     It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.     Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to become the nation\'s 35th president.     Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon\'s first term and was Reagan\'s director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.  \n',26

'No formal talks have been scheduled yet among companies involved in a controversial proposal to merge two groups seeking to enter Japan\'s international telecommunications sector, an official from one group said.     \"Nothing has been firmed up yet,\" said an official at International Digital Communications Planning Inc (IDC), one of the groups set up last year to study competing against Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which monopolises the sector.

'A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd DMP.MO by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd TRP.TO may short-circuit Dome\'s restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.     Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire.     Analysts said TransCanada\'s bid signals Dome\'s debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome\'s debt plan.     Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations.     TransCanada\'s proposal \"amounts to a quasi debt restructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto.     Calgary-based Dome\'s restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.     \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\" said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary.     TransCanada\'s announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said.     The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added.     \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said.     Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada\'s announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward,\" he said.     Dome does not consider TransCanada\'s proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility\'s announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.     Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada\'s.     Gowland said TransCanada\'s offer is probably a fair price for the company\'s 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.     However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome\'s debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada\'s proposed offer.  \n',26

'Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.     Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers, Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.     \"We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would insure that takeovers are properly financed,\" he said.     Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, Proxmire said.     In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC.     Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts.     Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days.     His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer.     To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced.     The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers.     Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.     He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve\'s 50 pct margin requirements.     The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.     \"When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it,\" Proxmire said.     Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment.     He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.     Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.     He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this year.  \n',26

'Reed International Plc REED.L denied rumours on the U.K. Stock market that it was the target of a takeover bid and said it had received no approach.     \"In view of the increase in our share price today, I want to make clear that we have not received any bid approaches,\" Reed\'s chairman Leslie Carpenter said in a statement.     Rumours that U.S. Publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc HBJ might bid for Reed, a paper and printing company, pushed Reed shares up 54p at 600p at one stage today before they eased back to 564p at the close against a background of a widespread decline in U.K. Equity prices.     Share market analysts said speculators were buying the stock on belief that Harcourt would bid for Reed in an effort to escape the unwelcome two billion dlr bid from Robert Maxwell\'s British Printing and Communication Corp BPCL.L.     Such a move would have made Harcourt too big for BPCC to take it over, analysts added.     They also said there was some speculation that if BPCC\'s bid for Harcourt was unsuccessful, it could turn its attention to Reed.  \n',26

'J Sainsbury PlcSNB.L said it agreed to take control of the U.S. Shaw\'s Supermarkets Inc through a combination of share purchases and a tender offer at 30 dlrs a share.     Sainsbury bought about 21 pct of the stock in 1983. It said its U.S. Subsidiary, Chene Investments Inc, bought 2.55 mln common shares from the controlling Davis family yesterday at 30 dlrs a share for 76.5 mln dlrs, lifting its stake to 49.4 pct.     A tender offer for the outstanding shares will be launched, also at 30 dlrs a share for a maximum further cost of 184.4 mln.     The Shaw\'s Board and the Davis family has agreed to accept the offer, thus assuring Sainsbury\'s a total holding of 74.0 pct.     The company had allotted 20.18 mln new ordinary shares to Warburg Securities Ltd which it said would be sufficient to finance about 188 mln dlrs of the maximum 261 mln dlrs payable.

'Corporate mergers and acquisitions in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had only a modest effect on the metropolitan area\'s economy, a leading business-backed organization said.     The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding communities had not.     Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but another 21 firms were added to the list.     Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco. During the period, only six located in the city achieved Fortune 500 status.     Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously hurt the economic climate of northern California.     However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were created during the period.     At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest of the United States and California.     Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news conference that the region had difficulties in persuading companies to locate there because of a fragmented local political system.     But he said that because of the amenities of living in San Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other metropolitan area.     \"It\'s a great place to run a business,\" he added, \"but it\'s a hell of a place to do business with government.\"     The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the restructuring activity.     Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp; Cooke and Rolm.     Companies that grew enough during the period to make the Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis, McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.     The study by the management consulting firm said that, partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth in San Francisco has slowed since 1980.     In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership had adversely affected some of the Bay Area\'s civic and charitable activities.  \n',26
'A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) SANM.MN to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources in the Philippine food and brewery company said.     A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC\'s outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former chairman of both SMC and UCPB.     Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.     Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB\'s plans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach of fiduciary duties.\"     The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a government nominee on the company\'s board.     De los Angeles, who represents SMC\'s minority stockholders, asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by the company\'s board.     On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company\'s retained earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends.     De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt to equity ratio. He quoted SMC\'s chief financial director Ramon del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.     In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.     De los Angeles\' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC\'s Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp for a down payment on the shares. The loan assumption was again ratified by last week\'s board meeting.     An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by April 15.     \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said in a statement.     \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the government\'s expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added.     A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on Cojuangco\'s court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial.\"     Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United States citizen.     The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \"A\" shares, which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \"B\" shares which are available to foreign buyers.     SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by the A.Soriano group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.     The sale was aborted when Diaz\'s Presidential Commission on Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend announced last June.     \"We have no objection to Soriano buying the \"B\" shares,\" Diaz tolds. \"But everything is on hold now.\"     The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company\'s annual stockholders\' meeting, scheduled for May 14.     San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in 1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of 700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.  \n',26
'Sweden\'s Sandvik AB SVIK.ST and Diamant Boart SA of Belgium, in which Societe Generale de Belgique BELB.BR holds an indirect 52 pct stake, have finalised negotiations on merging oil and gas drilling tool activities, officials of both companies said.     Staffan Paues, President of the new Brussels-based joint venture company Diamant Boart Stratabit SA (DBS), told a news conference that the merged firm would be able to offer products for all types of drilling operations.     He said there were already signs that a slow recovery from recession was under way in the oil and gas industries.     \"Stability in oil prices should lead to renewed investment\" Paues said.     DBS, which Paues said began operations today, brings together Sandvik\'s wholly-owned U.S. Subsidiary Strata Bit Corp of Houston and Diamant Boart\'s petroleum activities in Europe, North America, the Middle and Far East and Africa.     Paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall in oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back exploration activities. Officials said the complementary character of the two firms\' operations was a further reason.  \n',26

'The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a takeover attempt by Campeau Corp.     In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau\'s takeover offer.     Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.     On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had urged rejection of Campeau\'s Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said.     Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied\'s SEC filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.     Securities law requires takeover target companies to promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.     The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct of Allied\'s stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at thwarting Campeau, the SEC said.     Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an amended SEC filing, the agency charged.     Allied\'s first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct 3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint said.     DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or 48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes after it dropped its hostile tender offer.     The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.     The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal tender offer.     But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.     In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern, the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.     Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.  \n',26

'Dutch insurer Stad Rotterdam Anno 1720 N.V. ASRN.AS said from July 1 it will own 20 pct of the shares of Europeesche Verzekering Maatschappij N.V., a fully-owned unit of Swiss insurer Union Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft.     Stad Rotterdam chairman Lucas van Leeuwen tolds it may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies are found to be sufficiently compatible.     Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact Europeesche made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at below the shares\' intrinsic value. He gave no precise sum.     The Europeesche, which specialises in travel and recreation insurance, had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986.     Stad Rotterdam\'s premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion guilders, making it the fifth largest Dutch insurer.     Europeesche made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985, which narrowed to 4.5 mln guilders in 1986, van Leeuwen said.

'Sumitomo Bank Ltd SUMI.T is certain to lose its status as Japan\'s most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.     Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in October.     But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu tolds he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position.     \"We\'ll be back in position in first place within three years,\" Komatsu said in an interview.     He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo\'s profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand Sumitomo\'s branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak.     But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off.     Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank\'s large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch.     The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves.     \"They\'ve made bold moves to put everything in place. Now it\'s largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson.     Among Sumitomo\'s problems are limits placed on its move to enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.     Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.     \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.     But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.     \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so, we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three years, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.     Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home.     Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan\'s version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial from investment banking.     But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities.     \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust bank related. That\'s the kind of deregulation we want.\"     Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.     He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.      The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon, following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.     But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.     \"We don\'t want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years,\" he said.     Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.     The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.     \"It\'s (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said Kleinwort\'s Smithson.     \"After that, it\'s a question of absorbing and juggling around. It will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong.\"  \n',26

'A takeover battle began today for debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd DMP.MO as TransCanada PipeLines Ltd TRP.TO announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.     Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd IMO.A which is 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp XON.N, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd CP.N and British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L.     Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another proposal from \"a substantial company\" and discussions with a third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a statement.     The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada\'s bid, but did not identify the companies involved in talks.     TransCanada, Canada\'s largest natural gas pipeline operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which would own and operate Dome\'s assets. TransCanada said the offer is to Dome management, not to shareholders.     Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada, totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed. It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.     Dome\'s statement said the TransCanada announcement \"violated the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered into with prospective purchasers\" and was apparently timed to prevent Dome from considering other proposals.     It said the TransCanada bid \"seems to require favourable and substantial taxation concessions from the federal and provincial governments.\" But Dome added that its management and financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.     TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he was surprised at the vehemence of Dome\'s statement and denied that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. \"I find (Dome\'s statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce it,\" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the other bidders, or the terms of other offers.     Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at 5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.  \n',26

'A spokesman for Unilever Plc UN.AS declined to comment on market rumours that it may be considering a bid for the U.S. Health care group The Gillette Co GS.N.     Gillette shares are traded on the over-the-counter market in London and this morning stood one dollar higher at 38 dlrs in response to the bid speculation. Unilever dipped 33p to 3,275 in a generally depressed U.K. Market.     Most analysts dismissed the rumours saying it was an old story, and one commented that it was \"utter rubbish,\" adding he thought Unilever would not be interested in Gillette.     Gillette shares rose sharply at the beginning of the month on Wall Street rumours that Sir James Goldsmith was building a stake in the company.     Gillette has been the subject of repeated rumours since Ronald Perelman, chairman of the Revlon Group Inc REV, made an unsuccessful bid for the company last year.  \n',26
'Unilever Plc and NV UN.AS has issued a prospectus through investment bankers Goldman Sachs and Co seeking a buyer for Stauffer Chemical Co of the U.S., Which it acquired with the recent takeover of Chesebrough-Pond\'s Inc, a Unilever spokesman said.     He noted Unilever has been indicating plans to dispose of Stauffer, plus some smaller assets of Chesebrough, since the bid was made in December.     The Stauffer sale prospectus has been sent in recent weeks to a number of companies expressing interest.     The Unilever spokesman declined to say how much the group expected to receive for Stauffer.     Chesebrough\'s footwear and tennis racket businesses are also likely to be disposed of, he added.     Immediately available financial information on Stauffer, which is wholly-owned, was limited, he added. Nine month sales to September 1986 were about 1.2 billion dlrs.     Unilever aquired Chesebrough for 3.2 billion dlrs in order to benefit from its well-known toiletry brands and food products.  \n',26

'The government must announce harsh cuts in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give an adequate response to Australia\'s economic problems, the ANZ Banking Group Ltd ANZA.S said.     Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14 billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthly Business Indicators publication.     \"For the past two years, the government has struggled with an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it sees as politically practicable,\" it said.     The political climate meant there would be a continued over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and maintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.     \"The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival of business investment will be further postponed,\" it said.     The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by export and import-replacement industries which had created a false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of payments crisis were past. \"Unfortunately, successful adjustment to Australia\'s deep-seated economic problems remains a long-term process,\" it said.     In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderate overall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP) rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.     The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP this year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion at end-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.     Inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988 from 8.9 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were expected, ANZ said.  \n',27

'South Korea has decided on major changes in its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducing the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a trade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.     Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports could make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase &#127;nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which means abandoning Seoul\'s goal of rapidly reducing its foreign debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.     Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation and rationalising exports.     He said Seoul would try to limit its current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few years, although trade volume would continue to grow.     \"This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP (gross national product) from the current five pct level to three pct by 1991,\" he added.     Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea\'s foreign debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5 billion dlrs at end-1986.     \"But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,\" he said.     The policy change was announced two days before the scheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.     South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.     Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing in South Korea\'s current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose 36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.     The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5 billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw materials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.     \"The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at 1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are considerable incentives given to increase imports,\" Koo said.     Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency. \"It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean currency continues to rise in value,\" he said.     He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the dollar gradually, but added \"We do not believe in rapid one-shot changes in the value of the won.\"     The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen six pct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986.  \n',27
'Spain had a 35 mln dlr current account surplus in February compared with a 68 mln dlr surplus in January and a 355 mln dlr surplus in February last year, Bank of Spain figures show.     Spain\'s trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159 mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986.     Exports at 2.58 billion dlrs were up 19 pct compared with February last year, but imports were 46 pct higher than last February, totalling 3.16 billion dlrs.     Non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with 1.91 billion in February last year, reflecting the large ammount of investment goods entering the country with the recovery of the Spanish economy, the Bank of Spain said.     Spain\'s tourism earnings continued to grow and totalled 655 mln dlrs in February, compared with 103 mln dlrs in January and 502 mln dlrs in February last year.  \n',27

'Australia\'s economy should manage modest growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but unemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     The organisation\'s latest half-yearly report says Gross Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.     The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.     The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.     While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year, however, the report revises downwards the OECD\'s earlier growth forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.     The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is struggling to recover from a major economic crisis.     The country\'s GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year, should again show growth over the next two years, rising by 0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.  \n',27
'West German Economics Minister Martin Bangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country\'s leading economic research institutes for early introduction of a major tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.     In a statement reacting to the five institutes\' joint spring report, Bangemann said that as far as the call for bringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --     \"The government points out that the positive effects for growth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budget deficit) must not be allowed to be endangered.\"     Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned for 1988 had already been increased.     Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987, with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.     Bangemann said \"The government, agreeing with the majority, sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for exports expressed by the minority.\"     He said there was reason to believe that export demand would start to rise in the course of the year, partly because of a further increase in world trade.  \n',27
'A trade-led boom in the U.S. is unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its latest economic report.     Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year, after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.     As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5 pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke, the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.     \"Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause a falloff in the growth of disposable income,\" Van Dyke said.     Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8 pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.     The report was released before the Commerce Department reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May, after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with a 0.6 pct increase the month before.     The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9 pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.     This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income  growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.     As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.     The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in 1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.     \"For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988 or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,\" Van Dyke said.     Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an improvement in trade. \"However, with protectionist attitudes on the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,\" he added.  \n',27
'The Philippines\' first quarter growth figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose Fernandez said in an interview.     The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter from a year earlier.     \"I don\'t see anything on the horizon that should cut it (growth) short,\" Fernandez said.      NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year\'s GNP growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.     \"Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block,\" Fernandez said.     \"I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power, showed that the economy was on a different track from last year,\" he said.     Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it could drop off in the third quarter.     He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in 1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.     \"That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,\" he said.     He said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.     The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling 58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988. Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or August to review performance in the January-June period.     He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs. Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.     \"It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA (official development assistance) accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line,\" he said.     It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.     The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28 billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.     Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984 to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in October last year, had almost been completed.     He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well. \"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,\" he said.     Commenting on the country\'s foreign debt Fernandez said, \"I think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable.\"     The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach 29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.     NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.     Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.     Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country\'s exports more competitive.     \"By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country\'s trading partners,\" he said.     On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the Code.     The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has been delayed by objections from some business groups.     \"I think any central bank, certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and I\'m not about to do that,\" Fernandez said.     \"It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free,\" he said.     \"We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external availabilities simply by servicing our debts.\"  \n',27
'Economic growth will remain sluggish in the Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may rise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast.     Belgium\'s GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.     While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming its borrowing requirement, \"it will probably be insufficient to check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,\" the OECD said.     In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5 pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming less competitive and imports rising. \"Employment is forecast to decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the private sector and budgetary cuts,\" the report said.     Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987 and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining domestic gas prices.     Luxembourg\'s economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in wages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year. \n',27
'Kuwait\'s oil-reliant and debt-ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists say.     Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.     Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.     This was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.     Factors depressing economic activity include the 6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait\'s doorstep, which threatens the emirate\'s vital oil export lifeline through the Gulf and has sapped business confidence.     But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced.     The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.     The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending, thus generating an informal credit system.     Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies.     There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs) in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under.     The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not.     Banks\' shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil.     Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.     Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.     But strategic diversification into downstream operations in Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.     Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average 2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as crude.     Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady.     External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit Gulf.     Kuwait\'s petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.     But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these reserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit for the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.     In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary, revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct, doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.     This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some shortfall.     Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next.     \"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer is important.\"     Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy.     He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.  \n',27
'Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax reform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.     \"Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,\" Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.     Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he forecast in the February budget.     And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32 billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.     Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated revenues.     But finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system.     The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1 billion dlrs in 1991.     Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an actual 3.1 pct.     Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around the current four pct level over the next two years.  \n',27
'The West German government\'s independent council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said.     A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two pct was achievable.     It added the council believed \"an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for.\"     Ost\'s statement said experts believed further pressure on West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase.     The government regularly uses the term \"changed external economic factors\" when referring to the fall of the dollar, which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but could still fall below the 1986 level.     Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.     The stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the West German government ahead of next week\'s seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.     West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.     The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.     The experts\' prediction for economic growth this year of between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.     Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987 predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct, compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.  \n',27
'Figures for first quarter 1987 West German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal Statistics Office said.     The official said there had been a delay in gathering information for the data, which are expected to show that the West German economy contracted in the period.     A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.     \"There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical matter,\" he added.     The West German government is expected to come under pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.     However, government officials have ruled out any further tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.     Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the widest measure of a country\'s economic activity, fell in real terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.      The government has confirmed that growth was negative in the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to be about two pct.     Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank\'s reluctance to cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate, at three pct, is just above historical lows.     West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad, is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over two years.     The government has pointed out that depressed exports are the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will compensate for this setback.     It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.  \n',27
'The global economy is expected to weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook, economic analysts said.     For finance ministers and central bankers attending this week\'s semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern.     The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.     In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.     For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product, another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year.     The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt.     IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.     Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.     Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations\'  economies poses fundamental worries.     Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange, including the key one of exports.     The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion, has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only 2.3 pct, according to the IMF.     For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success.     The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade deficit.     Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much slower than expected.     The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect.\"     The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion.\"^M \n',27
'France\'s growth rate is expected to strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly higher than in the first half of this year.     The OECD said France\'s economic situation has deteriorated somewhat during the early months of 1987.      Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.     The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.     The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct for the whole year, sharply up from last year\'s 2.2 pct.  \n',27
'Malaysia\'s recovery from the worst recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988 after seven years of austerity, economists said.     \"Our country is walking on one leg now,\" said Ismail Salleh, an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International Studies. \"It has to depend on public sector investment for faster growth if the private sector is not moving.\"     Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.     The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply. Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.     The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.     Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.     Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.     One businessman said too many politicians give the impression that Malaysia was unstable.     \"If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential to recover strongly is great,\" a banker said.     Malaysia\'s 1987 current account is expected to be in the black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit surplus compared with last year\'s 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.     The government has said its fiscal policies will balance the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.     The government will also repay some of its external debt, which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.     Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential goods are unlikely to change.     Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to compete for investors with neighbouring states.  \n',27
'The five leading West German economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.     The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen predicted in the institutes\' joint spring report that gross national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast three pct 1987 growth in October last year.     Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin and Munich\'s Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.     The joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the DIW and Ifo were \"markedly less favourable\" than those of the other three.     The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year. \"In the second half of 1987 there will, however, only be a weak upward movement,\" they said.     The two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year.     The other three institutes, however, wrote: \"The decline in demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.\"     They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans. But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off. \"It can be presumed that the braking actions (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.\"     They added: \"The domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable.\"     These three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring.     However, this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar.     Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in 1987, \"there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year.\" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.     The three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986, while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.     They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in 1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.     All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23 mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about 200,000.     These three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures. The construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980 but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.     The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector, while \"the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline.\"     The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to 2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.     They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58 billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around 100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.     The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.  \n',27
'The five leading West German economic research institutes, which have revised down their forecasts for 1987 growth, do not predict a recession in West Germany, their spokesman, Hans-Juergen Schmahl said.     The institutes were divided in their spring report on forecasts for 1987, with three predicting two pct growth and two seeing only one pct expansion. Growth was 2.4 pct in 1986.     Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said, \"None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the beginning of a recession.\" He added, however, that exports remained the weak point of the economy .     Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect further encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets.     Arthur Krumper of Munich\'s Ifo institute, which with the DIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of the economy, said, \"The braking effects (on the economy) produced by external factors will remain considerable for most of the year.\"  \n',27
'Italy\'s economic outlook for 1987 and 1988 is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly lower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade deficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last year Italy ranked as one of the OECD\'s fastest growing economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.     The OECD said Italy\'s GDP may grow by three pct in 1987, but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.     The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report said.     This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.     Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in Italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.  \n',27
'Italy\'s Gross Domestic Product, calculated at 1980 prices, rose 2.4 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, compared with the same period in 1985, National Statistics Institute ISTAT said.     ISTAT said in a statement that GDP growth in fourth quarter 1986 was zero compared with the preceding quarter. Italy\'s budget ministry said last month that 1986 GDP rose 2.7 pct in real terms from 1985.     Imports in the fourth quarter totalled 26,361 billion lire, down 1.4 pct from the 1985 fourth quarter and down 6.6 pct from the third 1986 quarter, ISTAT said.     Istat said exports totaled 23,190 billion lire in the fourth quarter, down 4.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter and down 6.7 pct from the third quarter in 1986.     Fixed investments were 23,438 billion lire in the fourth quarter, down 0.7 pct from the preceding quarter and up 1.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter.  \n',27
'Prospects for world economic growth remain very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize currencies and encourage investment, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.     \"The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months, and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments imbalances are likely to persist,\" it said in one of its gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.     The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only 2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year\'s 2.5 pct growth rate.     \"We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area comfortably exceeding three pct,\" David Henderson, head of the OECD\'s economics and statistics department, said.     The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S., Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic downturn.     \"At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth remain favorable,\" it said, citing low inflation in most major countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible labor markets.     But private sector confidence had been undermined by uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that \"for confidence to be restored, it is important for governments swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.\"     This was a clear reference to last February\'s Louvre accord of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.     The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.     Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this process, though it was too early to estimate its precise impact.     He said the measures will help strengthen Japan\'s domestic demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.     The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct increase in 1986.     There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last year.     The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from price guarantees and other measures linked to production towards direct income support for farmers.  \n',27
'High wage settlements in Nordic countries threaten to cut exports and reduce the international competitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration in competitiveness. Sweden\'s competitive position was also seen at risk from accelerating wages.     The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as Norway, Sweden and Finland.     Overall economic growth will vary in the different countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report said.     After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark and Norway.     Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained and balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.  \n',27
'West German economic growth will slow to 1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic demand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its semi-annual review of the world economy.     This view is less favourable than the West German government\'s forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.     The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year, with the gross national product rising by two pct in real terms.     The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some recovery in business confidence in the near future.     But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by 2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986\'s 3.7 pct.     While noting that the government is bringing forward a five billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that \"the medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow relatively lower tax rates.\"     Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of 1986.     Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.     West Germany\'s current account surplus, the target of considerable criticism by the Reagan administration, is expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from 35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in 1988.  \n',27
'The United States should take urgent action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on growth of the defense budget, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy, said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit \"could seriously affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere.\"     It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987, running until September 30 this year, would substantially overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act\'s target of 144 billion dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.     \"The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190 billion dollars,\" it said.     While this would be 30 billion lower than last year\'s deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.     The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to 2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.     In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.     Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.     \"Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors behind the avoidance of recession,\" the report said.     The current account balance of payments deficit is expected to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.     In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year, unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct this year.     Canada\'s current account deficit is projected to shrink to around four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about that level in 1988.  \n',27
'Pakistan says its economy has continued its recent outstanding performance during the financial year 1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments, investments and energy were causing concern.     GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980 and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according to a government economic survey.      The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum and there was an impressive performance in a five point government program for rural uplift, education and poverty alleviation, said the survey.     Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.     The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.     Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from 2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.     More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in home remittances, he said.     The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to 2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of the boost in exports.     He said national investment continued to be small because of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the present growth rate and to finance the country\'s seventh five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.  \n',27
'Portugal\'s economy, which has been enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade, may now be strong enough to shrug off the country\'s latest government crisis, analysts said.     But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva\'s government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.     Cavaco Silva\'s minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.     The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office.     In 1986, Portugal\'s economy grew four pct, its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.     Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken.     \"The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation,\" said Fritz Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.     \"The market doesn\'t see this as a real crisis yet,\" economist Jorge Braga de Macedo tolds.     Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress.     The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution.     Portugal\'s developing stock markets, however, remain buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.     Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell, predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year.     But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development.     Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month, can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament.     Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution. \"There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections,\" Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said.     He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year.     The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority.     A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.     Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms.     The left-wingers said Portugal\'s positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD policies.  \n',27
'South Africa recorded annualised real growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this year and the economy should achieve the government\'s target of three pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.     The South African central bank said in its quarterly bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the nation\'s gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement in the rand\'s exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.     It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the third and fourth quarters of last year.     It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement reached with international creditors in March as evidence of improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.     The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa\'s short term foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.     South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of 7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus of 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninth consecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985.  \n',27
'South Korea\'s gross national product (GNP) will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise further as long as the current account surplus continues to widen, Deputy Prime Minister Chun In-Yong told reporters.     Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said his GNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will remain stable.     The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct.     GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and 1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures.     GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.     In the first four months of this year, the current account swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period.     \"What the Minister said does not imply any major economic policy change,\" a Ministry spokesman tolds. \"But he tried to urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic (future) ... A high won era.\"     South Korean manufacturers, who have insisted the won should not rise more than seven pct this year, have said they plan to ask the government to slow down its appreciation against the dollar.     The Bank of Korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05 against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986.     The won strengthened by 6.60 won to the dollar in three days earlier this month while an International Monetary Fund team held talks here to discuss revaluation.  \n',27
'Strong growth in domestic demand was a key feature of the economies of southern European countries in 1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal\'s total domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption.     Turkey\'s economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year.     In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment, had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong.     The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European Community and declining competitiveness.     In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather.  \n',27
'The economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.     Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.     \"These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?\" said Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.     The Commerce Department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.     Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending rose a weak 0.1 per cent.     \"Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing -- are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, \" Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics, tolds.     Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages.     To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise, returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption, he says.     \"I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,\" Gramley said.     Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia.     Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, \"The pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy\" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be accommodative.     Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession.     Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an inventory overhang still exists.     He says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.     \"They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a recession,\" Mauro said.     In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve.     \"Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable,\" he said.     But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation.     Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.     The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.     \"The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle, it continues to persist,\" he said, adding he would like the Fed to tighten credit.     A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says a prominent international banker.     Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National Press Club that the dollar\'s downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the United States is the world\'s largest debtor nation.     The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever. \"It is very difficult to be optimistic,\" Gut said.  \n',27
'The five leading West German economic research institutes said the government should do more to stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of tax cuts planned for 1990.     In their joint spring report the institutes were divided about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national product grew 2.4 pct last year.     But the report said all the institutes believed that \"more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created.\"     The institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. \"From this point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be brought forward.\"     The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.     However, the institutes criticised the government, not only for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of its financing had been left open.     The government has not specified how the remaining 19 billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for, though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.     The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government.     They also said the government should reduce tax preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value-added tax.     The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.     They referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this as an increase in subsidies.     The institutes said total subsidies, including tax preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it should be possible \"despite ... Major political difficulties\" to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.     The institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.     The report also noted that the government was progressing only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim for more competition, it said.  \n',27

'Hungary has announced sharp price increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.     The official MTI news agency said the government decided consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average 18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.     The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated economy, and could help dampen Hungarians\' appetite for imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive hard currency, the diplomats said.     The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in other East Bloc states, notably Poland.     MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive, with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including higher pensions and family allowances.  \n',27
'New Zealand\'s consumer price index, CPI, which measures the rate of inflation, rose 2.3 pct in the quarter ended March 31 against an 8.9 pct rise in the December 1986 quarter and a 2.3 pct rise in the March 1986 quarter, the Statistics Department said.     For the 12 months ended March 1987 the CPI rose 18.3 pct against 18.2 pct in 12 months ended December 1986 and 13.0 pct in the 12 months ended March 1986, it said in a statement.     Nearly half the increase in the latest quarterly index was contributed by the housing group, the department said.     The December quarter was significantly affected by the introduction of a 10 pct value added goods and services tax, GST, in October 1986, it added.     However, some GST charges not measured in the December 1986 quarter influenced the latest March quarterly figure, it said.     This is because of an unavoidable lag in price information, particularly on housing, used cars and insurance on household contents, it added.  \n',27
'Consumer prices in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rose 0.3 pct in February and inflation rose to 2.4 pct year-on-year, the OECD said in a communique.     The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working their way out of the index. The February increase was less than Janauary\'s 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for the later months of 1986.     Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in January was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year.      Retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct, less than January\'s 1.1 pct increase. Energy prices for consumers were still nine pct lower than a year earlier, it said.     Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 pct in February, in line with previous months, although there has been some acceleration noticeable in the U.S. And Britain.

'The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government implements an employers\' association recommendation for a 10 pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.     The government\'s own proposal for an across-the-board daily pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.     The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).     The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4 pct if the government\'s recommendation is implemented, Solita said. Both were proposed last month.     Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct by the National Economic and Development Authority early this month.     In the first three months of the year, inflation was a negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5 and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National Statistics Office said.     The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct in July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September respectively, the National Statistics Office said.     It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water prices.

'South Africa is expected to unveil tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year in a bid to boost the nation\'s flagging economic growth rate, economic analysts said.     Faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is expected to raise significantly the government\'s overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament, the analysts said.     Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.     \"Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,\" said Rob Lee, chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.     South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct.     Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5 pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over 30 pct.     Economists estimate that the government\'s spending target will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of GDP.     The government, having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget, analysts said.     \"The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,\" said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.     Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets.     South African Mutual\'s Lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49 billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5 pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the IMF.     \"The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,\" predicted one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past two years.     The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in September 1985.     Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation, government officials say economic growth is the prime objective.     But private-sector economists caution that the government\'s ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the current account of the country\'s balance of payments.     Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5 billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the nation\'s estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks.     Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has little room to manoeuvre.     Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and South African Transport Services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.     Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.     \"This will not be a very exciting budget,\" commented Harry Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive Federal Party. \"I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the sweets were given out before the election.\"  \n',27

New orders for manufacturing industry goods have mostly fallen or stagnated in recent months, but data for February finally showed a reversal of the trend, with a 1.9 pct rise.  \n',27
'Japan\'s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to a record 3.2 pct in May, the worst level since the government started compiling unemployment statistics in 1953, the government\'s Management and Coodination Agency said.     The May rate surpassed the previous record of 3.0 pct marked set in January and April this year. It was also up sharply from 2.7 pct a year earlier.     Unadjusted May unemployment totalled 1.91 mln people, up from 1.90 mln in April and 1.62 mln a year earlier.     An agency official blamed industrial restructuring and the strong yen for the rise in unemployment.     The seasonally adjusted male unemployment rate in May rose to a record 3.2 pct, surpassing the previous record 3.0 pct set in July 1986. This compares with 2.9 pct in April and 2.7 pct a year earlie. Unadjusted male unemployment totalled 1.12 mln, up 180,000 from a year earlier.     The female unemployment rate in May was unchanged from April at a record 3.1 pct. A year ago, the rate was 2.8 pct. Unadjusted female unemployment rose 100,000 to 790,000.     The yen\'s appreciation continued to affect employment in manufacturing industries and the total employed in May fell 210,000 or 1.5 pct from a year earlier to 14.10 mln.  \n',27

'Australia\'s M-3 money supply growth was 1.5 pct in March and 11.3 pct in the 12 months to March, the Reserve Bank said.     This compared with a revised rise of 0.5 pct in February and 11.1 pct in the year to end-February.     The Reserve Bank said the M-3 data for March was affected by the start of the operations of National Mutual Royal Savings Bank Ltd, which has resulted in the transfer of deposits (equivalent to around 1.5 pct of m-3) from the United Permanent Building Society to National Mutual Royal Savings Bank Ltd.     The Reserve Bank said M-3 money supply in March was 110.77 billion Australian dlrs compared with a revised 109.11 billion in February and 99.48 billion in March, 1986.

'U.S. banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy, but they do support the market\'s assumption that the Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit, economists said.     \"It\'s clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening,\" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago Corp.     Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.     Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were 935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.     Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the Fed had anticipated.     However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.     First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs, partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes.     As banks\' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.     Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late.     Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.     \"It\'s not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn\'t add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,\" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.     McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day, equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.     After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data, economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging  overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.     Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today\'s figures, he said, \"It\'s fair to say that the Fed may be moving toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.\"     Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate unless the dollar\'s fall gathers pace.     Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.  \n',27
'New U.S. Banking data suggest the Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists said.     But they also said that if money supply growth remains weak, as this week\'s unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary policy.     A survey of 17 money market economists produced a forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June 8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.     Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for the week ended June 1, this means the nation\'s money supply has fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks, economists said.     \"M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,\" said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.     While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen as better gauges of economic growth.     Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed\'s 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.     If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials, concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging, could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.     \"Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open market position? No,\" Sullivan said. \"But does this mean the end of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.\"     Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.     But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day net miss in the Fed\'s reserve projections, the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached.     A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging, while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.     \"If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed easing at some point,\" he said.     Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth. \"It has been a number of years since M-1 has given good signs of what\'s going on in the economy,\" one said. \"I don\'t think M-1 shows that the economy is falling apart and the Fed should ease.\"     Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary policy.     They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke off econmomic growth.     But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late April. \"The Fed has to determine if this represents a fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives them more room to ease,\" he said.  \n',27
'Robert Heller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said he expects \"more modest levels\" of growth in the money supply this year.     \"In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a most desireable development,\" he said in a speech prepared for delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange, Calif.     A text was released in Washington.     He said the effect of lower inflation and financial deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.     \"Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest levels,\" Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed after mid-January.     \"I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as well,\" he added.     Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.     \"The pricing behavior of American producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future,\" he said.     Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would \"generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector\" and might not gain more market share for U.S. producers.     \"A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be the result of such a behavior pattern,\" Heller warned.     He said \"we at the Federal Reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy.\"      Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes.     \"The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets,\" Heller said.     He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.     A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with Canada \"would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American producers to compete more effectively in that country,\" Heller said.  \n',27
'Four of West Germany\'s five leading economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.     But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin, echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not necessarily threaten stability.     The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.     The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.     Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may seem exaggerated, they said.     \"But it has often turned out in the past that the price climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into a restrictive policy,\" they said.     The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.     The four institutes disputed the view that monetary expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market investments following lower interest rates.     \"Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a smaller expansion of money supply,\" they said.     A return to growth and stability did not require spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.     The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic weakness other factors should be taken into account.     Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat in itself to price stability.     The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the falling mark.  \n',27

'Fifteen countries in Eastern and Southern Africa have agreed to cut tariffs on regional trade by 10 pct every two years up to 1996.     A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), which seeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the north to Lesotho in the south, said the governments would make the first tariff cut next year.

'Mounting trade friction between the U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia\'s exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said.

Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.     The surplus helped swell Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world\'s largest.     \"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,\" said Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters Taiwan Safe Group.     A senior official of South Korea\'s trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports are similar to those of Japan.     Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.     In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U.S.     In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further U.S. Pressure to block imports.     \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.     \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said.     The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong\'s biggest export market, accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.     The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern, Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.     \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very serious matter,\" Button said.     He said Australia\'s concerns centred on coal and beef, Australia\'s two largest exports to Japan and also significant U.S. Exports to that country.     Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the trade stand-off continue.     Japan\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.     The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget and record public works spending in the first half of the financial year.     They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s avowed fiscal reform program.     Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto Kuroda, Japan\'s deputy minister of International Trade and Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an effort to end the dispute.  \n',27
'U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige leaves on Saturday on a 10-day trip to the Far East to help spur U.S. Trade and improve business relations with China, South Korea and the Philippines, U.S. Officials say.     Baldrige will also stop in Hong Kong to meet British officials and local U.S. And Hong Kong businessmen.     The U.S. Last year had major deficits with three of its Asian trading partners -- South Korea 7.1 billion dlrs, Hong Kong 6.4 billion and China 2.1 billion. The deficit with the Philippines was 800 mln dlrs.     Baldrige will meet South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan and Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae on Monday to discuss opening South Korean markets to more U.S. Goods.     Baldrige will be in Peking from April 21 to 24. He will meet Zheng Tuobin, minister for foreign economic relations and trade, attend a meeting of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade and address a management and training organisation.     However, U.S. Officials said a chief purpose of Baldrige\'s visit would be to discuss relaxed U.S. Rules for transferring modern technology to Chinese industries.     In Hong Kong, Baldrige will hold meetings on April 27 with Governor David Wilson and Trade and Industry Secretary Eric Ho, as well as addressing the American Chamber of Commerce.     U.S. Officials said Baldrige will meet Philippines President Corazon Aquino on April 28 to show continued U.S. Support for her government and to discuss steps it could take to improve the atmosphere for American investment.     He will also will meet Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin and Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion.  \n',27
'Brazil\'s September trade surplus was the best so far this year, totalling 1.494 billion dlrs, compared with 1.434 billion dlrs in August and 540 mln dlrs in September last year, Banco do Brasil\'s Foreign Trade Department (Cacex) director Namir Salek said in a news conference.     September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down from 2.76 billion dlrs in August. Imports in September amounted to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August.     Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a similar 1986 period.     Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222 mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986, Salek said.     The Cacex director said he expected the country\'s trade surplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three months of the year, estimating the year\'s overall surplus to reach 10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and 15.4 billion dlrs of imports.     He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured and semimanufactured goods. He mentioned car exports, which accounted alone with sales of 617 mln dlrs in the Jan-Sept period, against 194 mln dlrs in a similar 1986 period.  \n',27
'A British minister said he had given the Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its internal markets \"and it was clearly understood.\"     Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were beginning to appreciate the need to be \"fair and open\" about access to their own markets.     At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition charges that his trip had been a failure because he had returned empty-handed.     \"I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very clearly, and it has been clearly understood.\"     Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in Britain.     \"It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing them to carry out other kinds.\"     \"I hope we don\'t have to use these powers, but I made it clear in Japan that if our timetable isn\'t met, we shall use them.\"     He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.     \"I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to be fair and open about access to their own markets.\"     On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc CAWL.L, which is trying to win a significant share of telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.     He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday, he said.     Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan, but would have to coordinate action with its European Community partners.     Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as it has threatened.  \n',27
'Australian Minister for Trade Negotiations Michael Duffy said his country and Third World commodity producers have formed an effective lobby group against farm export subsidies and market access restrictions.     Duffy told a press conference the Cairns Group of 14 major agricultural producers, to which Australia and Thailand belong, has emerged as an important third force in any multilateral trade talks. \"There\'s no doubt that the Cairns Group is being seen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in other international trade negotiations,\" he said.     Duffy, here on a three-day visit after talks in the United States, The European Community (EC) and Latin America, said considerable progress has been made by the group towards fighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed countries.     The minister said the EC Commission\'s new farm trade paper will recognise the heavy financial burdens imposed by its Common Agricultural Policy and its future expansion.     He said the Reagan Administration has also displayed a determination to resist the currently strong protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress.  \n',27
'Canada had a trade surplus of 1.25 billion dlrs in February compared with an upward revised 623 mln dlrs surplus in January, Statistics Canada said.     The January surplus originally was reported at 533 mln dlrs. The February surplus last year was 189 mln dlrs.     February exports, seasonally adjusted, were 10.44 billion dlrs against 9.85 billion in January and 10.05 billion in February, 1986.     February imports were 9.19 billion dlrs against 9.23 billion in January and 9.86 billion in February, 1986.  \n',27
'Canada will propose at the new round of international trade talks that most trade-distorting farm subsidies be phased out over a five year period, Trade Minister Pat Carney said.     \"Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created a vicious circle which continues to cause problems of overproduction and low commodity prices,\" Carney told the House of Commons.     Carney was outlining the government\'s new position on the farm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in the multilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).     While few details were released, Carney said the government would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial barriers.     \"Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade,\" a government background paper said.     \"Furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs, credit could be given to countries which effectively control the output of farm products,\" the papers said.  \n',27
'Canada has threatened to stop imports of Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish agriculture ministry official tolds.     The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached for support.     Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: \"Denmark will not accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC.\"     Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.     Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.     But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC regulations. \"Canadian officials are very concerned about the trade implications. We are holding active discussions with the EC and bilaterally,\" she added.  \n',27
'Canada plans to monitor steel shipments flowing in and out of the country in an attempt to appease concerns in the U.S. over the high level of Canadian steel exports, Trade Minister Pat Carney said.     \"To help maintain our open access to the U.S. steel market, the government is taking further action to ensure we have more accurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is not used as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,\" Carney said.     Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to exercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries were considering establishing a joint commission to study the growing steel problem.     Carney told the House of Commons she will soon announce an amendment to the Exports and Imports Permits Act to set up the monitoring program.     Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct cent of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the level just two years ago, Canadian trade officials said.     The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from several countries in the face of a decline in the domestic steel industry.     Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada\'s share of the American market be limited to 2.4 pct.  \n',27
'Canada\'s trade picture has brightened considerably, underscoring economists\' predictions the sector would post a long awaited recovery this year.     The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February, double January\'s 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986\'s 189 mln dlr tally.     \"Hopefully it\'s the beginning of a trend,\" said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.     Economists generally don\'t expect such large gains over the next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year.     \"We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year, and it certainly looks as if this morning\'s figure is indicative of that,\" commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.     Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month.     \"Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in February,\" the agency said in its monthly report.     Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.     Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year\'s dismal 10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion dlrs.     Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.     The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading.     Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy.     Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.     The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading.     Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy.     They say the country\'s consumers, who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country.     Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United States, by far the country\'s largest market, is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.     \"We maintain what\'s going to drive Canada\'s export performance is income growth in the U.S.,\" said Midland\'s Donegan.     But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February\'s trade upturn.     Jestin said, \"Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate that part of the strength (in Canada\'s trade figures) is probably transitory.\"  \n',27
'chile\'s trade surplus narrowed to 102.2 mln dlrs in february, from 105.4 mln dlrs in the same month last year, but it was above the 18.2-mln-dlr surplus recorded in january 1987, the central bank said.     Exports in february totalled 379.4 mln dlrs, 17.2 pct above the january figure. Imports fell 9.2 pct from the previous month to 277.2 mln dlrs. The figures for the same month last year were 314 mln and 208.6 mln dlrs, respectively.

'China\'s trade deficit in the first quarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same 1986 period, customs figures show.     Zhang Zhongji, spokesman of the State Statistical Bureau, quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28 billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.     He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only 350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their level at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.     Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.     Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved incentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain more foreign exchange from the goods they sell.     He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose 35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46 billion. Exports to Japan fell 2.3 pct to 1.28 billion and imports 24.4 pct to 2.14 billion.     Exports to the U.S. Rose 23 pct to 640 mln dlrs and imports fell 26.7 pct to 840 mln. Exports to the EEC rose 35.1 pct to 770 mln dlrs and imports fell 3.8 pct to 1.5 billion, he said.  \n',27

The trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared with a 56 mln dlr surplus in january 1986.

'Financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year\'s federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.     The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.     Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year.         \"In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit,\" said Stanley Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.     \"At best, it will have a small positive effect,\" Collander said in an interview.     Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.     The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar\'s value is fraught with danger.     Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.     In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels.     As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit.     The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.     \"If you don\'t deal with the budget deficit, everything else you do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.     Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government\'s purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States.     Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.     Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none.     But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets.     \"There\'s no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Fed\'s flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer is, it\'s not enough,\" Silvia tolds.     The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government\'s most vexing and persistent problems.     The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year\'s figure will be any lower, though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year\'s end.     In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget.     On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986-1991 period by last year\'s Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.     While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year\'s federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.     \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you\'re going to get\" out of Congress at the present time, said Touche Ross\'s Collander. \"To do something more than that would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\"     Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.     \"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street.\"     The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year.     The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.  \n',27
'The European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC officials said.     Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat, fish and cereals by-products.     But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the officials said.     The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.     Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat, saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500 tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.     Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.     The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal\'s entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).     But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country\'s EC membership.     Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada.     Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC claims that Spain and Portugal\'s entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation.     Japan\'s main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.     EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists: \"We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough.\"     \"We hope that there will be an improvement,\" he said.  \n',27
'The European Community (EC) has effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its market to imports before it decides on possible tough retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.     They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26 to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.     The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are \"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.\"     Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese exports.     The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action.     They said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.     In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.     Japan\'s trade surplus with the Community has grown steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March.  \n',27
'The European Community launched an investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark an intensification of world trade strains.     Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the U.S.     The EC Executive Commission said today the European Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.     Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the Japanese.     The Commission said it believed the Association had given sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found the complaints were justified.     The Commission claims last year\'s accord between the U.S. And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged access to the Japanese market.  \n',27
'The European Community is willing to offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations next year, an EC commission spokesman said.     He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this month between U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq.     EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S. Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones, the spokesman said.     Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S. Manufacturers.     It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will rob it of 130 mln dlrs\' worth of exports a year.     Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will take place in London and will also involve the aerospace ministers of France, Britain, West Germany and Spain, the countries involved in the Airbus project.  \n',27
'Top-level talks last week between the European Community (EC) and the United States failed to resolve a dispute over pasta which may provoke new trade frictions next month, diplomatic sources said.     The U.S. Insists the EC complies with what it regards as an unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and dismantles an export subsidy system which has led to Italy taking an increasing share of the U.S. Pasta market.     The sources said the EC, which currently provides subsidies of around 16 cents a pound, offered a compromise in last week\'s talks in Brussels but that this was rejected by the U.S.     U.S. Assistant Special Trade Representative Jim Murphy has returned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadline for agreement, set last August when the two sides resolved a related dispute over EC restrictions on U.S. Citrus imports.     The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly. It was also possible the U.S. Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC pasta, lifted when the citrus row was settled.     But the two sides may agree to extend the deadline for a few days as EC Commissioners Willy de Clercq and Frans Andriessen are due to visit Washington from July 7 to 10.  \n',27
'Ecuador posted a trade surplus of 10.6 mln dlrs in the first four months of 1987 compared with a surplus of 271.7 mln in the same period in 1986, the central bank of Ecuador said in its latest monthly report.     Ecuador suspended sales of crude oil, its principal export product, in March after an earthquake destroyed part of its oil-producing infrastructure.     Exports in the first four months of 1987 were around 639 mln dlrs and imports 628.3 mln, compared with 771 mln and 500 mln respectively in the same period last year.     Exports of crude and products in the first four months were around 256.1 mln dlrs, compared with 403.3 mln in the same period in 1986. The central bank said that between January and May Ecuador sold 16.1 mln barrels of crude and 2.3 mln barrels of products, compared with 32 mln and 2.7 mln respectively in the same period last year.     Ecuador\'s international reserves at the end of May were around 120.9 mln dlrs, compared with 118.6 mln at the end of April and 141.3 mln at the end of May 1986, the central bank said. gold reserves were 165.7 mln dlrs at the end of May compared with 124.3 mln at the end of April.  \n',27
'Ecuador posted a trade deficit of 71.3 mln dlrs in the first eight months of 1987, compared with a surplus of 468.6 mln dlrs in the same period of 1986, central bank figures show.     Ecuador suspended oil exports, which made up 55 pct of the value of its total exports in 1986, for five months this year after an earthquake in March shattered the country\'s pipeline.     The central bank said the value of exports from January to August 1987 stood at 1.132 billion dlrs and imports 1.204 billion dlrs. Net international monetary reserves declined to 57.5 mln dlrs at end-September from 146.8 mln dlrs at end- September 1986.  \n',27
'The European Community (EC) accused the United States of violating a political commitment to free trade through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a customs user fee.     EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.     Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to improve its balance of payments.     The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules by restricting imports of agricultural products through an import licensing system. The United States asked for consultations with Tokyo on the issue.     Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers, pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.     When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT jargon as \"standstill and rollback.\"     Tran criticised Washington for the \"superfund\" tax on oil imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government procurement list for reasons of national security.     Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.     The surveillance body will send a record of today\'s talks to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round, to decide any further action on the charges.     The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.     The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel\'s report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its legislation.     Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community, brought the dispute to the GATT last year.  \n',27
'Colombian exports other than coffee rose 55 pct in January compared with the same period last year, figures from the government statistics institute show.     Non-coffee exports amounted to 180.8 mln dlrs fob compared with 147.5 mln dlrs for coffee, a drop of 42 pct from last year.     The trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared with a 56 mln dlr surplus in January 1986.     The national planning department forecast that in 1987 coffee, Colombia\'s traditional major export, will account for only one third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs.  \n',27
'Following is the text of a statement by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting yesterday.     1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of seven major industrial countries met today.     They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of their heads of state or government.     The managing director of the International Monetary Fund also participated in the meeting.     2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting, and noted the progress achieved in implementing the undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.     They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.     In this connection they welcomed the proposals just announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan\'s economy through early implementation of a large supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.     The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.     3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.     In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation of the Louvre Agreement.     They concluded that present and prospective progress in implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to foster the stability of exchange rates.  \n',27
'Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint against Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.     The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will favor the U.S.     \"These are quota items, and the principles that apply to them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus,\" Lyng tolds in an interview.     He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on beef and citrus after March 31, next year.     The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some cheeses and specialty fruit juices.     U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has been delayed by the illness of the tribunal\'s chairman.     The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect Japanese farmers.     \"We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an illegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.     He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next April if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.      \n',27
'The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm\'s total annual export earnings for export promotion abroad.     The move is designed by the government to improve India\'s trade deficit.     Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.     The scheme replaces current rules which allow different amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.     RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value of annual export earnings.     These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil, psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.     RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.     Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.  \n',27
'With more private investment, not more protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two congressional agencies said today.     The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S. textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for optimism than a few years ago.     \"While textile producers are making significant investments, they could do more,\" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.     The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than increased trade protection which could lead to foreign retaliation.     CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections, first imposed in the 1950\'s have had only a small benefit for profits and investments of domestic firms.     Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against congressional approval of protectionist textile quota legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other Asian textile producing countries.     President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is expected to be voted on in the House this year.     However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles showed a weakening of support for the legislation.     Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic markets, Kelly said.     He added that private investment in the textile and clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.     Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.     \"The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered, and that exports can be expanded,\" Kelly said.  \n',27
'Israel\'s exports to the U.S. can and must double over the next five years if the mideast nation\'s goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad Yaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.     Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S. were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel\'s total exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.     \"I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis on product quality,\" Yaacobi said.     While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European currencies is a \"bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,\" Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend toward higher U.S. exports.     In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.     Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.      He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would continue to facilitate the desired export growth.     Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S. firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.     Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able to achieve its economic potential.     Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing military conflicts \"which were imposed on Israel,\" he said.     Short of achieving Israel\'s full growth potential, however, Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.  \n',27
'Italy\'s Foreign Trade Minister Mario Sarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press, said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign securities.     Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month\'s overall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April\'s 2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign securities purchases.    \"The deficit can be better attributed to premature and delayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags) rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment,\" Sarcinelli said in a statement.     Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by the Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and said it had been partly caused by \"non-banking capital outflows.\"     \"In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flow of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our borders,\" said the newspaper.     But the newspaper added that it was still not possible to say how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchase deposits had affected Italy\'s balance of payments.  \n',27
'Japan is disappointed at the recent threats of trade retaliation from the European Community (EC) just as the trade situation between the two is improving, Japanese Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura said.     \"I am deeply concerned that the EC has moved to take a harsher line toward Japan despite this tangible improvement,\" he said in a speech prepared for delivery at the opening of a new centre designed to improve understanding between the two sides.     Last week, foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations agreed to impose tariffs on a range of unspecified Japanese electrical goods unless Tokyo opened its markets more to EC exports.     Tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in Japanese imports of EC manufactured goods in the year ended March 31.     \"I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance through expansion.\"     \"While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficit between Japan and the EC, I believe it should be rectified not by reducing trade through import restrictions or export restraints, but by expanding the (overall) trade,\" Tamura said.  \n',27
'Japan\'s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of the committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said.     The plan will also urge the government to double 1985\'s official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior LDP officials said at a press conference.     LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain the plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.     Abe\'s visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.     Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated. However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe will be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.     The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by the government will probably include the purchase of super computers, LDP officials said.     According to the plan, Japan will also strive to solve specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.     The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and lessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.     The basic ideas of the LDP\'s plan were presented to and welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial nations in Washington last week, they said.     The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be unveiled by the government in late May.  \n',27
'Basic reform of Japan\'s protected farm sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade surplus, securities analysts said.     The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they said.     \"In economic terms, reform would be a plus,\" said Christopher Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.     The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S., The analysts said.     Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the average household\'s budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.     Reducing these prices could increase household spending power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on products which would have a more direct impact in boosting domestic growth, it added.     \"There\'s a lot of slack,\" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo said. \"All that money could be spent on something else.\"     Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37 billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.     Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential development would also give a boost to domestic spending, economists said.     \"Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the expansion of domestic demand,\" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor at Kyoto Gakuen University.     Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the farm sector. Employers groups also want change. \"If you really want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,\" Bumpei Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers\' Associations told a recent press conference.     External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade deficits with Japan.     But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.     Although the full-time farm population is falling and there are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.     The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon, the analysts said.     Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for national food security, they said.     Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.     Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.  \n',27
'A top U.S. Official said Japan has little chance of persuading the U.S. to drop threatened trade sanctions, despite the efforts of a Japanese team that left for Washington today.     Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, was asked at a press conference whether Japan\'s moves to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could persuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports said, and replied: \"...It is probably too early for the figures to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to permit the result you have described.\"     Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.     \"There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area, but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on security and political issues,\" he said.     \"The question is whether through cooperative actions between our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist legislation,\" he said.  \n',27
'Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports.     Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan\'s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.     The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japan\'s failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.     They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers.     Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.     President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement.     In making the annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade.\"     Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan\'s semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.     Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan\'s inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.     About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.     Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.     Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.     He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan\'s decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI\'s power to control Japanese traders.     \"The United States has excessive expectations.,\" he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.\"     He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.  \n',27
'Japan\'s Agriculture Ministry, angered by U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan, a senior ministry official said.     \"Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers,\" the official, who declined to be named, said. \"Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market,\" he said.     Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S. Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers.     Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said. End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.     U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.     Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31.     Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.     U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.     An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S. Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business.     The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices, purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts, prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.     To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan\'s top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products.     But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector.     \"Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these issues should not be discussed on the same table,\" the official said.  \n',27
'Japan must try harder to reduce its trade surplus or the yen will come under renewed upward pressure, Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo.     He told a press luncheon he hoped Japan could cut its current account surplus by some 10 billion dlrs a year until it is reduced to some 50 to 60 billion dlrs. In the fiscal year ended March 31 the surplus totalled 93.76 billion dlrs, or about 4.5 pct of GNP.     The 6,000 billion yen economic stimulation package the government unveiled late last month would help slash Japan\'s current account surplus by five to six billion dlrs, he said.  \n',27
'Japan\'s trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.     In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct.     But it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988, \"thus weakening the international adjustment process.\"     It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.     The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.     The OECD outlook said, \"Continued large current account surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen.\" It said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth.     The OECD said Japan\'s Gross National Product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986\'s 2.5 pct growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a 0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.  \n',27
'Japan warned the United States it may take retaliatory measures if the United States imposes its planned trade sanctions on April 17, a senior government official said.     Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Trade and Industry Ministry, said in a statement Japan would consider measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on some Japanese exports as planned next week.     However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.     Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called Japan\'s failure to honour a July 1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the United States and to open its home market to American goods.     Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not listened to Japan\'s explanation of its efforts to live up the pact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanation of why it planned to impose the tariffs.  \n',27
'Japan does not plan to take immediate retaliatory action against implementation of U.S. Tariffs on some Japanese electronic goods, the minister of international trade and industry, Hajime Tamura, said in a statement.

Kuroda said the U.S. Decision was based on incorrect data and an exaggerated sense of MITI\'s power to control market forces. \"The U.S. Has excessive expectations. To stabilise supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time,\" he said.     Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip sales in Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here.     He said if he fails in talks tomorrow and Friday to forestall sanctions, he will seek further talks with U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. U.S. Officials said this week\'s talks are unlikely to delay imposition of tariffs.  \n',27
'The tough trade sanctions President Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across Japan\'s bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.     But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings Institution, a think tank, said \"a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern.\"     He said it left the United States open to retaliation.     The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws, and no new protectionist legislation is needed.     In the past year tough trade action had been taken against the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights, patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a \"serious signal\" to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.     Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers, television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the American consumer, Fitzwater said.     Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.     The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.     The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about one-third of America\'s overall deficit.     But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all.     Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that \"I regret that these actions are necessary,\" but that the health and vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to American competitiveness in world markets.     \"We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices,\" Reagan added in the statement from his California vacation home at Santa Barbara.     He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan abided by the agreement.     U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress - which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.     The White House aide said of the tariff action, \"it wasn\'t done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade practice.\"     The aide added, however, \"on another plane, it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws.\"     But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the United States, and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.     \"It\'s very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,\" he said, \"because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade.\"     Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country, and therefore its impact on Congress.\"     He said, \"I don\'t think it makes a lot of sense.\"     But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress, and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.     Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don\'t want a trade war,\" but the imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.     Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country, and therefore its impact on Congress.\"     He said, \"I don\'t think it makes a lot of sense.\"     But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress, and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.

'A group of Latin American and Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.     Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of American States special committee on trade, said he was aware of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added \"the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills.\"     He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit, and \"it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests.\"     Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.     Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large, annual trade surpluses with the United States.     Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States, but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2 billion dlrs, against Japan\'s of 58.6 billion dlrs.     The European Community has also opposed the bills.     Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration\'s opposition to many of the sections in the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.     He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor, expected next week.     Rodriguez said \"the region needs trade to continue development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation.\"     Rodriguez said: \"we need to keep the market opens - especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress.\"     President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed \"protectionist,\" and his aides now are mounting a effort to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the legislation.     Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez said as yet \"the administration is not in a veto frame of mind.\"  \n',27
'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said the United States will continue its policy of subsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is a global agreement to end such subsidies.     In an interview withs, Lyng also acknowledged he was troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program (EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports that the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.     \"Yes, I\'m troubled with that a little bit,\" he said. \"There\'s no question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow, the longer it is to wean it.\"     In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growing list of commodities to an increasing number of countries.     Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies \"just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy\" and said he saw an end to the expansion of the EEP.     \"I\'m sure there\'s an end to the expansion, but we are doing this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that we\'ve lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those, particularly the European Community, who, we are convinced, are the worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, that we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to some agreement to put an end to it,\" he said.  \n',27
'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware his demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus markets is likely to be rejected.      But in an interview withs during the flight to Tokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an international spotlight on Japan\'s agricultural import protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open its markets.     \"(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but they are not going to give us anything,\" Lyng said.     U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions during Lyng\'s two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions would be unveiled later this month, they said.     \"If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,\" when he visits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.     Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.     A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.     Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.     He cited the example of a California company which transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than the value of the animal, he said.     U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986 quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.     Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese mandarin orange industry.     The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And Japanese officials have said.    Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries, but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.    Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies, including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.  \n',27
'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the United States opposes key parts of the proposal.     \"We\'re pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal. It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,\" Lyng tolds in an interview Tuesday.     Lyng\'s comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission. The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.     Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.     The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.     However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is unrealistic.     Asked about such criticism, Lyng said \"The alternative to doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I think that is the unrealistic position.\"     \"I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are trying to say.\"     Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations  started.     \"All that some countries would like to have would be a wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat. That doesn\'t do a thing for us,\" Lyng said.     The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he said.     At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.     The United States will be represented at the meeting by former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, recently appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture.  \n',27
'Malaysia\'s manufacturing exports rose by 24.5 pct to 15.1 billion ringgit in 1986, chairman of the Export Promotion Council Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamind said.     The improved export performance was led by electrical and electronic products, textiles, footwear, clothing, processed food, timber, chemical and rubber products, he told a news conference.     However, total gross exports for the year declined by 5.6 pct to 35.9 billion ringgit from 38 billion in 1985 due to a fall in major commodity exports and weak prices, he said.  \n',27

Miyazawa also said he told major industrial nations when he was in Washington last week that present exchange rates are not necessarily good.

'Pakistani government allowed freer cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed at narrowing the country\'s yawning trade gap.     Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech the government had also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of Pakistani products.         Cotton and rice are Pakistan\'s main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s.     But Haq said now the private sector would also export cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a long-standing demand of the local traders.     The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries compete effectively in the world market, he said.         Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but reviewed every year.     It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a longer period.     He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided for the export of engineering goods to selected third world countries on soft credit terms.         Pakistan\'s 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23 billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.     He said the government policy was to rationalise and streamline import controls.     \"It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports, specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,\" he said. \"Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise to smuggling and hampering of exports.\"         He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed from import restrictions.     Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.  \n',27

'President Reagan called for continued nondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United States in the face of congressional opposition because of the Bucharest government\'s record on human rights.     A White House statement said Reagan\'s decision to press for continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for Romania had been \"exceptionally difficult\" and came after \"all options were seriously considered.\"     But the statement said that despite concerns about human rights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president had decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on human rights practices there.     The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress requests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungary and China.     The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill legislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending certification by Reagan that the country had made progress on human rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFN for Hungary and China.  \n',27
'President Reagan today is to announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls Japan\'s failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade.     The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative\'s Office.     Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film.     The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.     In his March annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.\"     He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.     U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagan\'s plan to invoke the sanctions.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  \"we do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action.\"     Reagan\'s move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits, with last year\'s hitting a record $169.8 billion.     About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.     Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.     He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.     Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation.     The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the results showed up.     U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.     Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT).     It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.     U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States.  \n',27
'South Korea will cut import taxes on 50 goods, including construction equipment, cigarettes and tobacco, to help reduce its trade surplus with the United States, the Finance Ministry said today. The tariff cuts of between five and 30 pct will take effect on July 1.     South Korea ran a trade surplus of 7.3 billion dlrs with Washington in 1986, sharply up from 4.3 billion in 1985.     Today\'s announcement brings to 157 the number of goods for which similar measures were taken this year, a ministry official said.

'Secretary of State George Shultz said the U.S. Would erase its large foreign trade deficit faster than many predicted, and the consequences for its trade partners might be traumatic.     \"The U.S. Economy will inevitably make the adjustment necessary to move from a deficit to a surplus trade balance in order to service our growing foreign debt,\" he told a conference attended by the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and their leading Western friends.     \"In my view, this will happen more rapidly than many observers now predict.\"     \"The universal strategy of aggressive export-led growth is becoming less effective,\" Shultz said.     \"It is not arithmetically possible for every country in the world to be a net exporter at the same time. The U.S. Deficit, which we all decry, has been in a sense the place into which everyone\'s export-led strategy for growth has gone.\"     \"The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed on this deficit, so something will have to give and it will be possibly a traumatic experience,\" he added.     \"While you must keep up the pressure on us to eschew protectionist policies, you must act too,\" Shultz said.     \"I can do a better job of convincing the Congress to leave our door open to imports if more of our trading partners open their doors wider,\" he told the group, which included representatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the European Community.  \n',27
'U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz warned members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) they could no longer rely on increased exports to the U.S. For growth.     \"Given the importance of exports, particularly export manufactures, to all of your countries, you are going to have to work hard to diversify your markets,\" he said.     \"While you may be able to maintain your current market share in the U.S., You clearly will not be able to look to the U.S. To take major increases in your exports,\" he added.     Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand the U.S. Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many now believed.     He said ASEAN\'s looming trade problems would not necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being contemplated by Congress, \"but simply because of the adjustments the U.S. Economy will have to make in order to service our large and growing external debt.\"     Shultz said the U.S. Deficit had resulted not from falling exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth.  \n',27
'U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last week went further than the U.S. Had expected.     But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.     Speaking in a televised news conference linking several European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and global demand.      \"There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was originally thought,\" said Shultz, speaking from Washington.     \"It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.     \"It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the economy,\" he added.     But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might decide at next week\'s Venice summit to lift its sanctions on some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:     \"These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an agreement that had been reached between the United States and Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip market.     \"They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the agreement that it made become evident.\"     He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a trend on only one month\'s data.     The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that Japan had violated last September\'s bilateral agreement by selling computer chips at below fair market value.     Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.     Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the problem.     He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would contain a major reduction.  \n',27

'South Korea\'s trade surplus is growing too fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.     He told a press conference the government planned to increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus \"at a proper level.\"     But he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.     The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.     Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years.     \"Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now the surplus is growing faster than we expected,\" he said.     Trade ministry officials said South Korea\'s exports rose 35 pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.     Kim said the swing of South Korea\'s current account to a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time.     South Korea\'s foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest in Asia.     \"This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development... Last year was a major turning point for the Korean economy,\" Kim said.     Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country\'s GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from about 50 pct in 1986.     \"The government, however, does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,\" he said.     Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with Seoul\'s major trading partners, particularly the United States.     \"We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a proper level,\" Kim said.  \n',27

Western analysts attributed the deficit rise with the West to the world oil price slump, which hit Moscow\'s main export and cut hard currency earnings needed for purchases in the West.  \n',27
'Spanish farm minister Carlos Romero, speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers, called for action to help the Spanish maize market, Spanish diplomatic sources said.     Spain is threatened with massive imports from third countries by the end of the year, they said.     They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum into Spain from third countries this year.     Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to make direct purchases.     The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the Spanish market.     They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help.

'Council of Economic Advisers chairman Beryl Sprinkel said the Reagan Administration remains strongly opposed to a tax increase, including 18 billion dlrs of new revenues in the budget plan by Congressional Democrats.     \"We believe that significant increases in taxes would not reduce deficits and could have adverse effects on growth,\" Sprinkel told the House Rules Committee.     He said the Administration wanted to continue its policy of gradually reducing deficits through restraining government spending and promoting economic growth. Sprinkel said cutting the budget deficit was the best way to lower the trade deficit.  \n',27
'Taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with Washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the United States.     Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry\'s Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington.     \"The move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United States,\" he said.     He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct.     The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added.     Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the island\'s largest trading partner.     Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with Taipei.     Washington\'s deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year earlier, Taiwan\'s official figures show.     Today\'s announcement came before a departure later today of a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of trade talks with U.S. Officials.     The delegation\'s leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last night he was leaving with \"a heavy heart,\" meaning that he would face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan\'s 1986 trade surplus with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.     Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S. Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products, purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment, import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.     \"I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from our talks with the U.S.,\" he said without elaborating.  \n',27
'Thailand\'s trade deficit widened to 4.5 billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a year ago, the Business Economics Department said.     It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht from 58.7 billion. Thailand\'s improved business climate this year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials and semi-finished products.     The country\'s oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the first quarter due to lower oil prices.     The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6 billion baht from 56.6 billion.     Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower earnings from many key commodities including rice whose earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26 pct and canned pineapples seven pct.     Products registering high export growth were jewellery up 64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.  \n',27
'Toshiba Corp TSBA.T and Sharp Corp SHRP.T decided to maintain exports of lap-top personal computers to the European Community (EC) at last year\'s levels, despite the halt of shipments to the U.S., Company spokesmen tolds.     They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting EC sanctions urged by European computer makers. The Europeans feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April.     Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the personal computer market in the EC, the Sharp spokesman said.     Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers would continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being.     Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top personal computers would continue at last year\'s level of 12,000 to 16,000 units a year.     Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan\'s alleged failure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade.  \n',27
'Member states of the European Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.     Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.     However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.    Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.     The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S.     The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC\'s trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March, up from 1.94 billion in February.  \n',27

'The Administration asked Congress to replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.     The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.     Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they should pay about the same rates of duties.     Yeutter said, \"American exporters will find it far easier to deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of differing systems which they now face.\"     He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.     Yeutter said government and business moves are based on data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.     He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under the new system, with about half expected to join the system by January 1988.  \n',27
'The Commerce Department said on that insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1 billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.     The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after the initial trade report to issue a second report on a \"customs value\" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance charges from the cost of imports.     Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.     A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been revised downward.     The Commerce department would like to have the law changed to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.     \"My feeling is the second one is a better report but there\'s legislation that requires us to delay it two days,\" said Robert Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.     \"But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays any attention to the second figure.\"     The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.     The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in 1979.     Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison with other countries that reported their trade balances on the same basis.     The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration.     Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.     \"We\'re considering it,\" he said, \"It\'s one of those dinosaur laws and I think it\'s time has come.\"     The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration.

'The February monthly merchandise trade figures to be reported Tuesday by the Commerce Department will be on a new basis reflecting more recent data, so avoiding future revisions of the monthly figure, Commerce officials said.     The overall January deficit of 14.8 billion dlrs will be revised, but the February figure will be a final one, officials said.     Previously, the initial monthly figure has had to be revised in subsequent months because of the time lag between the report and the compiling of final estimates on imports and exports.     The reporting of the February trade data was delayed several weeks to permit gathering latest figures on imports and exports to give a clearer picture of the monthly trade balance.  \n',27
'House Speaker Jim Wright dismissed charges that the trade bill before Congress contributed to the fall in stock prices on Wall Street.     \"That is utterly ridiculous,\" the Texas Democrat told reporters.

'The United States may lift an additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later this month, Reagan Administration officials said.     President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.     The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and portable computers.     Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at below production costs.     Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.     The Administration officials said Commerce Department  monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking sales away from American-made semiconductors.     They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would be lifted by the end of the month.     The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.     U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan\'s compliance with the agreement earlier this week.     The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.  \n',27
'Britain\'s Defence Minister George Younger said the U.S. Was unfairly protecting its defence industry, and this could lead to British firms demanding counter-measures.     Younger told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting that U.S. Legislators were failing to realise \"the true nature of the two-way street in terms of ideas, technology and equipment.     A British parliamentary report said that up to March British firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of contracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure.     The committee said U.S. Technology export restrictions and \"selectiveness\" towards foreign contractors had denied British competitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them from technological research for SDI.     Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts under conditions of fair and open competition. \"All we ask is for our companies to be given similar opportunities,\" he added.     If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair subsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be surprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures, Younger said.  \n',27

'The use of tariffs and quotas to reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do little to cut the nation\'s swelling trade deficit, a government study said.     In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said, such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re-exported in different forms.     \"Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,\" it said.     The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.     Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.     \"Although each industry\'s competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find that there have been no significant industry-specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit,\" the study said.     \"To the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,\" the FTC study said.     Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.     It also said it found a \"fairly direct relationship\" between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign consumer demand.     The study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.     In each case, the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.  \n',27
'The United States is prepared to \"pull out all the stops\" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador to GATT Michael Samuels said.     Those rights are now being challenged by the European Community\'s (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.     He reiterated Washington\'s firm intention to retaliate if the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.     The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat shipments into the EC.     The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S. trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed prices over the current market level and which may be extended to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.     Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies, an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade negotiations, \"is meaningless if import barriers continue to be erected,\" Samuels said.     Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, \"visionary\" and \"very serious.\"  The EC and Japan have said it is unrealistic.     The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally next week.     The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of farm subsidies.     The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major trade distortions, Samuels said.     Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally submitted and respond to it officially then.     \"We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,\" the U.S. Ambassador said.     The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.     The key difference between the two approaches is that the U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.     If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze, there would be little incentive for the Community to work to correct the international trade situation, he added.     Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.  \n',27
'A trade bill before the United States House of Representatives \"is a very dangerous bill for Canadian industry,\" Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told reporters.     By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S. countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3 removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.     \"Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language,\" he said.     The Canadian forest lobby\'s Zimmerman also said the House of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian resource exports to the U.S.     Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber to the U.S., Zimmerman added.     Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S. forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.     \"We represent the first victim of the move to price other countries\' natural resources according to the U.S. system,\" Zimmerman said.     \"If we\'re an example, than other resource industries had better watch out,\" he added.     Zimmerman said the Canadian Forest Industry Council plans to discuss concerns about the U.S. trade bill with lobby groups from other Canadian resource industries.  \n',27
'U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.     Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry\'s Economic Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help Japan as well as the United States.     The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.     However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was already the world\'s largest grain importer.     Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food requirements in 1985.     Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on beef, citrus products and rice.     Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice because potential production is higher than domestic demand.     The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of rising production by exporting countries, he added.     Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product output with expensive programs, Maki said.     Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter will join.  \n',27
'The White House has completed a new review of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan last April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.     They said the president\'s Economic Policy Council looked at Japan\'s adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.     But there was no hint what the announcement might be.     Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.     But they also noted that the White House has said it was unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the world\'s seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.     The officials added that while the curbs complicated U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt  Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.     Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for Japan\'s failure to honor commitments to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs and to open its own market to U.S. goods.     The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television sets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.     Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted as soon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adhering to the pact.  \n',27
'U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact, according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy research groups.     The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross border trade would benefit both countries.     But Cato chairman William Niskanen added \"the two nations\' generally harmonious trade relations are probably not sustainable without a new agreement.\"     The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers remaining between their two countries.     The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining remained.     Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and this could hit some Canadian trade practices.     He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.     Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S. exports to Canada.     A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.     It would also increase the gross national products of both countries.     Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.  \n',27
'The United Arab Emirates (UAE) recorded a 1986 trade surplus of 12.2 billion dirhams, narrowing from 30.2 billion in 1985, the central bank\'s latest bulletin shows.     The central bank said the lower surplus was mainly due to the decline in the value of exports and reexports to 37.2 billion dirhams from 54.2 billion in 1985. This reflected the decline in oil prices last year and difficulties in marketing UAE oil, the central bank added.     The surplus on the current account narrowed to 6.8 billion dirhams from 25.5 billion in 1985. The overall balance showed a surplus of 4.8 billion after 2.6 billion in 1985.  \n',27
'Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the global trading system.     He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.     The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it trade in agriculture and services such as banking.     Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.     The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and many services.     Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli pacts \"other countries have realized that if they want to continue to have access to the world\'s largest market, they had better get serious about improving the GATT.\"     The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially increase the gross national products in both countries.     Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.     Yeutter said, \"increasing trade is one of the keys to enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.\"     He said, \"a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries that need to increase trade in order to better their standards of living.\"     Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to protectionism.     He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions against nations with large trade surpluses with the United States if the countries practiced unfair trade.     The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still rising.     Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President Reagan\'s efforts to liberalize the world trade.     Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.     He said, \"President Reagan will veto any bill that contains serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.\"  \n',27

'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was almost sure Japan would not retaliate against tariffs President Reagan slapped on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese electronic goods today.     \"I\'d say it\'s 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) will not provoke a retaliation on American products,\" Yeutter told Cable News Network.     \"Japan has far too much at stake in this relationship (with the United States) to seriously entertain thoughts of retaliation,\" Yeutter said.     Earlier today, Reagan  imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan\'s alleged violation of a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade.     Yeutter did say that U.S. farm products would be targeted if Tokyo decided to hit back.     \"If they (Japan) were to retaliate, it would probably be on something like American agricultural products,\" he said.     \"But I really think the chances of that happening are between slim and none,\" he added.  \n',27
'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.     Asked in a television interview what the chance was for Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese electronic exports, he said \"slim to none.\"     Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to retaliate for Japan\'s failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.     Yeutter, on the NBC program \"Today,\" said the United States did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.     He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take time to monitor any compliance.     Asked how long that would take, he said \"We want to see a pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would take a few weeks.\"     Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods because the items selected are also readily available from other countries and manufacturers.     He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.     \"It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that full well,\" Yeutter said.     He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but \"that\'s more of a paper kind of exercise and I don\'t really expect to see any adverse impact on U.S. trade.\"     Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.     He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a major issue, would be productive but \"I don\'t see any practical way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his visit.\"  \n',27
'National Bank economic data for 1986 shows that Yugoslavia\'s trade deficit grew, the inflation rate rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and the value of the dinar fell.     The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.     Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.     Yugoslavia\'s balance of payments surplus with the convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344 mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.     Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank\'s data showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.     Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.     Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages were too high given the level of productivity.     Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.     Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9 billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs abroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.     The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard currencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against the Swiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar, 46.2 pct.  \n',27

'Denmark\'s net official reserves rose to 60.629 billion crowns in May from 48.380 billion in April, against 39.481 billion in May 1986, the Central Bank said in its monthly balance sheet report.     Total net reserves, including reserves held by commercial and major savings banks and corrected for exchange rate adjustments, rose to 58.373 billion crowns in May from 47.835 billion in April, against 32.443 billion in May 1986.     The Bank said in a statement that public loan transactions accounted for net capital import of 0.1 billion crowns in May, with net registered private capital imports of 9.1 billion.     \"Of this, the net sale of Danish crown bonds to other countries totalled about 2.5 billion crowns. There was balance between the purchase and sale of foreign securities,\" the statement added.     The Central Bank said that figures for private bank reserves and registered capital movements were provisional and there was no estimate yet of unregistered movements.     \"It is therefore not possible on this basis to draw conclusions about the developments of the external current account,\" the statement added.  \n',27
'French official reserves rose 258 mln francs in May to 420.50 billion francs from 420.24 billion at the end of April, the Finance Ministry said.     The slight rise partly reflected the repayment last month of France\'s outstanding 11.95 billion francs of debt owed to the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).     It also reflected a negative 314 mln franc position with France\'s Exchange Stabilisation Fund after intervention purchases of 10.6 billion francs during May.     Foreign currency holdings fell 7.28 billion francs to 124.58 billion while ECU holdings fell by 5.55 billion francs to 58.52 billion due to the repayment of part of France\'s debt owed to the FECOM and Stabilisation Fund operations, the ministry said.     Claims on the IMF rose 1.14 billion francs to 18.97 billion, including a 385 mln franc increase in France\'s reserve position with the IMF and a 751 mln franc rise in holdings of Special Drawing Rights.     Gold holdings were unchanged at 218.46 billion francs.  \n',27

'Spain\'s foreign reserves rose by 905 mln dlrs in February to total 17.05 billion dlrs, compared with 14.11 billion dlrs in February 1986, Bank of Spain figures show.     Under a new accounting system introduced this month, Spain\'s foreign reserves now exclude foreign currency held by financial institutions.     Under the previous system, Spain\'s foreign reserves would have risen by 391 mln dlrs in February, taking into account a fall of 514 mln dlrs in financial institutions\' foreign currency position.     In January this year, the Central Bank\'s foreign reserves rose by 143 mln dlrs, while financial institutions\' foreign currency position fell by 118 mln dlrs.  \n',27
'Sight deposits of commercial banks at the Swiss National Bank fell 4.64 billion Swiss francs to 7.88 billion in the first 10 days of April, the National Bank said.     Foreign exchange reserves rose by 9.4 mln francs to 33.12 billion.     Sight deposits are an important measure of money market liquidity in Switzerland.     The National Bank said banks repaid around 5.8 billion francs of traditional central bank credit taken out to meet their end-of-quarter liquidity requirements. This was partially offset by new swap arrangements.     Bank notes in circulation fell 440.2 mln francs to 24.48 billion while other deposits on call at the National Bank -- mainly government funds -- fell 840.5 mln francs to 941.5 mln.  \n',27
'Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves, bouyed by rising exports, have hit a record high and are likely to soar to 72 billion U.S. Dlrs by the year end, central bank officials said Tuesday.     Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the reserves totalled about 69 billion U.S. Dlrs, compared with about 42 billion at the same time last year and 68 billion on October 5. He declined to elaborate.     A senior bank official, who declined to be named, tolds the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs at the end of the year.     \"The surge in reserves is the result of our trade surplus and recent purchases of U.S. Dollars on the local interbank market,\" Chang said.     Taiwan\'s trade surplus hit a record 14.95 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first nine months of 1987 compared with 11.05 billion a year earlier, official figures show.     Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-hsien said the surplus will rise to about 20 billion dlrs by the end of the year. About 80 pct of the surplus will come from the island\'s trade with the United States.      Chien said Taiwan\'s trade will reach 80 billion U.S. Dlrs this year compared with 63.96 billion last year.     Its exports are expected to total 50 billion and imports 30 billion against exports of 39.79 billion and imports of 24.17 billion last year.  \n',27

'The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K. Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11 general election, market analysts said.     Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.     But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now available to the authorities to support the pound should curb any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the ruling Conservative Party\'s lead slipping, they added.     \"We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we have done hitherto,\" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the record reserves rise.     He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign exchanges. \"We have been playing a very full part ourselves,\" he said.     But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down its rise, more in the light of local factors.     Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities, said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.     U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.     Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.     Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0 pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.     \"The market doesn\'t want to do anything because of the election,\" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.     Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the forward market.     The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth the pound\'s sudden downturn, while some of the intervention reported in May probably occurred in April, they said.     The key three months interbank money market rates eased about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves news, analysts said.     Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was muted as traders worried about the funding implications of another huge rise in reserves, they added.     Morgan Grenfell\'s Bell forecast a half point base rate cut from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove accurate, with another half point later.     Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be possible. \"Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in future, rather than this active intervention,\" he predicted.     Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut looked likely.     A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.     \"The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And has signalled some worry about broad money (growth),\" said Robin Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.     He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the European Monetary System.     But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10 or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.  \n',27
'Britain\'s gold and currency reserves rose a record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in May, following April\'s 2.9 billion dlrs increase, the Treasury said.     The underlying trend indicates the level of recent Bank of England intervention on currency markets to curb sterling\'s strength. It was above market expectations which had been for a rise of between one billion and three billion dlrs.     The Treasury declined comment on the figures.     Actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in May, compared with April\'s 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68 billion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of April.     Borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 238 mln dlrs, against April\'s 66 mln. Repayments under the scheme were 85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repayments of eight mln, after three mln last month.     Repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs.     The underlying reserves increase is net of borrowings and repayments.     It was larger than the previous record 3.04 billion dlrs rise seen in October 1977. The May increase represents the seventh monthly rise, with reserves up 9.947 billion dlrs in that period, and up 9.816 billion since the start of 1987.  \n',27

'Finland\'s national oil company Neste Oy NEOY.HE said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firms to study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton, Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.     The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.     The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.     The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the important capital and operating advantages gained by locating on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.     The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer that can replace tetra ethyl lead.     Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of health concerns, the statement added.     Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE, it said.     Finland\'s Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.     The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on stream in late 1989, the statement said.  \n',28
'Japanese oil companies are starting campaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growing domestic demand for higher quality motor fuel, oil sources said.     Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this summer, starting with Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd on June 20.     Showa Shell Sekiyu KK SHOL.T introduced its Formula Shell 98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year.     Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.     \"We have received a good response from consumers of Formula Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel consumption,\" Showa Shell said.     Shell\'s product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share of Japan\'s high octane gasoline market, it said.     High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell\'s total gasoline sales in Japan, it added.     Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately after the launch of its Idemitsu 100.     Nippon Oil Co Ltd NPOL.T said it will launch its 100 octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in high octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline sales.     The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station construction in the next two to three years.     \"Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline production quotas,\" an official at a major oil company said.     An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil companies increase their international competitiveness.     Japan\'s three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil, Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under the production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.     Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 2.5 pct from the previous year, according to a MITI report.  \n',28

'U.S. analysts expect the American Petroleum Institute\'s weekly report on oil inventories to show a slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended May 29, oil traders and analysts said.     While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that barring any surprises in tonight\'s report, they expect the report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.     Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil prices, the analysts said.     Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports continue at relatively high levels.     Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.     Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who looks for a build said, \"We have had five weeks of gasoline demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw,\" he added.     Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.         The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.     But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3 pct above May 22\'s 81.2 pct capacity operated.     Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add to U.S. stocks.     But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery runs.     Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between 700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was discounted as having a market impact at this time.     \"A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,\" one futures analyst said.     Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build between 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels reported by API for the week of may 22.     The consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added to the nation\'s inventory.  \n',28
'A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its crude oil without breaching OPEC accords.     Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company\'s Petroleum Community magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations. \"The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions...And take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production,\" he said.    \"The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market,\" he added.     OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.     Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline OPEC showed.     Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was ADNOC\'s most difficult ever but \"a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment.\"     He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.     In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.  \n',28
'Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.     December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.     \"Fundamentals are awful,\" said Philip Lambert, analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln bpd, little changed from September levels.     Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. and International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September production at 18.5 mln bpd.     The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday\'s hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian, in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.     The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.     Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S. Attack, analysts said.     They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.     Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities, analysts said.     But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.     Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew, said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.     \"The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response. Today\'s action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,\" Pyne said.     Kleinwort Grieveson\'s Lambert said the U.S. Strike was \"a responsible retaliation,\" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict.     Chase Manhattan\'s Nicol took a different view, however.     He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation.     The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.     The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinburger.     Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower, analysts and traders said.  \n',28

There were rumors in world oil markets on Tuesday that Iran had fired shells at an oil camp in northern Kuwait in retaliation for U.S. Attacks on Iranian oil platforms in the Gulf on Monday. \"Several shells fell in a random manner on the northern border of the country,\" the official told KUNA. \"It seems these shells arose from an exchange of fire between Iran and Iraq... No one was wounded and there were no losses.\"     Diplomats said shells from the nearby Iran-Iraq warfront had in the past fallen in the northern Kuwaiti desert.     A senior Kuwait Petroleum Corporation official had earlier tolds he was unaware of any attack against Kuwaiti oil installations.  \n',28
'Australian crude oil and condensate output fell 7.6 pct to 23,480 megalitres, or about 147 mln barrels, in the first nine months of fiscal 1986/87 ending June 30, the Department of Resources and Energy said.     The decline in production in the nine months to end-March reflected mainly a sharp dip early in the fiscal year, when low oil prices and high marginal excise rates led to a reduction of output from Bass Strait, department figures in its Major Energy Statistics publication show.     A megalitre is 6,290 barrels.  \n',28
'British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe backed the United States\' attack on an Iranian oil platform on Monday and said it should not worsen the Gulf crisis.     \"The United States is fully entitled to take military action in exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of the imminent threat of further attacks,\" Howe said in a statement issued in London.     The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a U.S.- flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday.     Referring to that attack, Howe added, \"I trust the Iranians will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense.\"     At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of European Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked about statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was now involved in a full-scale war.     \"It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified for Iran to react in that way,\" he said.  \n',28
'A North Sea oil find announced by Chevron Corp\'s CHV Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate a new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln barrels, industry analysts said.     Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K. Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API crude oil from the tertiary \"Alba\" sand through a three-inch surface choke.     \"The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320 mln barrels,\" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson and Co tolds.     He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25 pct.     Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be plugged and a sidetrack drilled.     \"The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs up,\" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.     Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well showed that it flows well.     \"Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low, it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be recovered,\" Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew tolds.     However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the analysts\' reserve estimates. They said that without further research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not disclose any reserve figures.     Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial and developed, there would be a ready local market for the heavy crude it produced.     \"Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a lot narrower today,\" Osborne said.     Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies which include British Petroleum Development Ltd, DSM Hydrocarbons (UK) Ltd, Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd, Marathon Int. Pet. (GB) Ltd and Phillips Petroleum Co U.K. Ltd.  \n',28
'A Colombian group announced the suspension of its bombings of oil pipelines pending the government\'s levy of a social tax on foreign petroleum companies and an 800 mln dlrs fine on the Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.     There was no indication the government would meet the conditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army (ELN).     According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carried out 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986.     The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have caused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage.     In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults.     Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per day in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigating Occidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion.     If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up to 800 mln dlrs. The ELN demands the government charge the penalty.  \n',28
'Norway is expected to seek a compromise solution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S STAT.OL (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firm will operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said.     The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the field\'s operator through the development phase, with Statoil taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.     Oil Minister Arne Oeien tolds the government had today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision had been taken and several questions remained unresolved.     It was unlikely the government would announce its decision on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday\'s cabinet meeting and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies, the sources added.     This spring Norway\'s state-owned oil company Statoil exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by Conoco.     Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as the most likely candidate for the first field development project on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway.  \n',28
'Rep. Mike Synar said today that while President Reagan is ready to use military force to protect Kuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-prepared at home to deal with a new energy crisis.     Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S. participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing program of the International Energy Agency.     The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was formed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal with any future oil cutoff.     Synar said, \"the president is prepared to take military action to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our nation for the next energy crisis.\"     Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil, increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar, who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action in a previous IEA test, said the United States successfully advocated a test limited to training participants in oil sharing procedures and the system\'s mechanical aspects.  \n',28
'Crude oil netback values in complex refineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. last Friday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore, according to calculations bys Pipeline.     The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S. relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly gasoline, and support from crude oil prices.     Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe rose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices there. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel or three pct from the previous week.     In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to 19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct.     Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts a barrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct.     But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell sharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ample distillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices.     Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of 68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week.     For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values were mostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts. The value of Kuwait crude fell 14 cts to 18.37 dlrs, while Iranian Light fell 11 cts to 19.14 dlrs.     On the U.S. West Coast, netback values for ANS CIF L.A. also jumped sharply, up 40 cts a barrel or 2.2 pct to 18.82 dlrs on higher gasoline prices.  \n',28
'A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab allies, Western diplomats in the region said.     U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf in response to a missile strike on the American-registered Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.     \"We consider the matter closed,\" he said, a signal the U.S. administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.     Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action would endanger American interests.     Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran\'s War Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a \"crushing blow.\"     \"The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely,\" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.     Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.     Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.     Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they said.     \"The ball is in Iran\'s court now. It\'s up to Tehran to respond one way or the other,\" a diplomat said.     President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American countermeasures if the military escalation continued.     Western diplomats and military sources in the area said shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act the United States could have taken once it had decided to retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans and Kuwaitis on Iran.     \"It\'s interesting that they chose something in international waters because it doesn\'t implicate any other nation,\" one diplomat said. \"This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf Arab states, particularly Kuwait.\"     Commented another diplomat: \"Kuwait must be happy that the U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked on its doorstep.\"     One source said of the attack on the oil platform: \"They managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the least nuisance to everybody.\"     A diplomat commented: \"They were very clever in the place they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn\'t devastated anything because it wasn\'t working in the first place.\"     A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke: \"This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up ... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans).\"  \n',28
'The Energy Department said it reached proposed oil pricing settlements totaling 680,150 dlrs with the operator and four working interest owners of A.D. LeBlanc No. 1 well, Vermillion Parish, La.     Trigon Exploration Co., Inc operated the well from June 1979 to January 1981 for D. Bryan Ferguson, C. William Rogers, Omni Drilling Partnership No 1978-2 and Entex Inc.     DOE alleged Trigon caused overcharges of 624,208 dlrs by improperly classifying its oil as \"newly discovered crude,\" a classification that allowed charging higher prices during a period of price controls.     It said the proposed settlements would resolve disputes over possible violations by the five parties. DOE added that in agreeing to the settlements, the five did not admit any violations or non-compliance with its regulations.     It said it would receive written comments on the settlements before making it final.  \n',28

'The European Community (EC) should watch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War and their consequences on the oil market, EC Energy Commissioner Nicolas Mosar said today.     Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in the Gulf, Mosar warned, \"An escalation in the Gulf would increase tensions in the oil market.\"     \"But I do not want to be alarmist,\" he told a news conference after an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg.     He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last year. \"There are also other potential sources of supplies in the world,\" he added.     The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the ministers\' meeting, he added.     A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil supply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual meeting on June 19, he said.     But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC foreign ministers, diplomats said.     West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm for backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchant ships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oil supplies.  \n',28
'Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil output on May 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring Colombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said.     Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at Lago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific.     About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some 50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said.     Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the earthquake.     The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in Colombia, the starting point of Columbia\'s pipeline to the Pacific ocean port of Temuco.     The government estimates it will take about four more months to repair the Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline and return output to normal levels, the spokesman said.  \n',28
'Ecuador will resume limited crude output next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean Petroleum Corp (CEPE) said.     CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to neighbouring Colombia.     Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an earthquake damaged the country\'s main pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific port of Balao.     It will take at least until the end of July to repair the pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.     To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying 55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point of Colombia\'s pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.     The original target date to resume limited crude output was May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman said.  \n',28
'Ecuador will produce crude oil in excess of its 221,000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of this year, Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a news conference.     Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to 320,000 bpd next January, the minister said.     \"We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria and Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to produce during the past few months,\" he said.     Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean production from March to May this year.     Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC members during last week\'s meeting in Vienna, when an increase in Ecuador\'s quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved.     \"They understood our position and we believe we remain within the spirit of the (quota) agreement,\" he said.     Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported.     While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four mln barrels of products, Santos said.  \n',28
'Ecuador will use a new pipeline link with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years, Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.     The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5 by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,     Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.     The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling will begin in September.     \"The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only for this emergency period but for the next five years, with possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) will be pumped along it,\" Perry said.     Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents per barrel during the first year.     The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador\'s jungle oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the Pacific port of Tumaco.     Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for Colombia\'s 11 km segment but said it was \"insignificant compared with what we are going to earn.\"     OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before the quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln dlrs per month, Espinosa said.  \n',28

'Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000, probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.     \"I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000). Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable,\" Hodel told the Senate Energy Committee.     Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.     Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.     \"The area could contain potentially recoverable oil resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides almost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production,\" Hodel said.     He said production from the new section could begin about the time Prudhoe Bay production begins to decline in 2000 without endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area.  \n',28
'Following are extracts from the communique issued at the conclusion of the OPEC conference here.     \"The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive results of the agreement signed in December, 1986, by which OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18 dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings distributed into national production levels.     \"The conference noted that all market indicators, including spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC crudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidating the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement.\"     \"The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the second half of the year and decided that in order to secure continued firm prices in the market, OPEC production during the fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third quarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into the same national production levels as were defined by the above-mentioned agreement for that quarter.\"     \"Furthermore, the conference decided to establish a committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices in order to secure price stability around the opec price structure.     \"Should there be any significant change in market prices, the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the year, which would secure the desired market stability.\"     \"The conference reiterated the necessity of member countries\' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December 1986, both in terms of official price, and national production, levels.     \"For this purpose, the conference decided to establish a committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the terms of the agreement.\"      \"Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market stability.     The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group of five heads of delegation established by the 77th (extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 to undertake the necessary contacts with those countries.     \"The conference observed the continued fall in the value of the U.S. Dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied and reported to the next meeting of the conference.\"      \"The conference discussed the appointment of the secretary general and decided to discuss the matter again in its next ordinary meeting.     \"The conference extended the term of office of Fadhil al-Chalabi as deputy secretary general for a period of one year from October 7, 1987.     \"The next ordinary meeting of the conference will be convened in Vienna on December 9, 1987.\"   \n',28
'OPEC\'s agreement to limit output to 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost spot prices and enable the group to raise its official reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current 18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.     \"Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in January,\" a Japanese refiner said.     The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.     Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for U.K. Brent, traders said.     They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.     \"With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further,\" said a Japanese oil trader.     Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term, having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.     \"You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis, there\'s no reason for prices to go up again today,\" said one international oil trader in Tokyo.     \"But I think if there\'s any sign of a dip, it will be bought back up again pretty quickly,\" he added.     One oil industry analyst concurred, \"There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on.\" He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.     Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices.     Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.     Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd, against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.     Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast.     Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels. \"Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much,\" an oil industry analyst said.  \n',28
'France voiced its comprehension for a U.S. Attack on an Iranian target while calling for a swift halt to the Gulf War to avoid further escalation.     \"The French authorities reaffirm their attachment to the freedom and security of navigation and to the right of all states to take action under international law and the United Nations charter to halt attacks such as that of October 16,\" the Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement.     The United States said its forces destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf and struck at a second on Monday in retaliation for a recent Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti ship.     Washington said the platforms were used to monitor shipping and to launch small-boat attacks on shipping.

'Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.     One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield, was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.     The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60 metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S. Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.     The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section of the structure remained.     U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S. forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had been caught laying mines.     But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday and the Sea Isle City on Friday.     Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.     Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.     But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result of U.S. intervention and Iran\'s response.     The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a U.S. \"tit-for-tat\" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.     He said with this appraoch America would suffer \"the death of one thousand cuts.\"     But for the United States to grab the initiative militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran\'s harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its shipping must pass, Schuler said.     He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off, Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.     Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.     He said the United States should also threaten to mine and blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a settlement.     Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by invading Iran\'s territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.     Each side has attacked the others\' shipping.  \n',28
'India\'s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) plans to drill more wells in the Bombay offshore area, where a well spudded in February this year gave both oil and gas, an ONGC spokesman said.     The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres, yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas per day, he said.     \"The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80 km north-west of Bombay, indicates good prospects of both oil and gas. We\'ve decided to drill at least three more wells in there before starting production on a commercial scale.\"     Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshore field, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the last two years.     ONGC produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 ending March, up from 27.51 the previous year. Bombay High accounted for 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before. India\'s total oil output is around 30 mln tonnes.     ONGC has been exploring the Bombay offshore area, developed since the late 1970s, for more oil as production from Bombay High has reached a plateau.  \n',28
'Indonesia\'s state oil company, Pertamina, has informed its affiliated Japanese companies that crude oil supplies will be 40 pct less than contractual volumes in July, a spokesman for an affiliated company said.     He said the allocations were in line with Indonesia\'s production ceiling under its current OPEC quota, so they might be increased if OPEC ratifies a production rise next week.     Allocations of Indonesia\'s main traded crude, Minas, had been cut by 50 pct and Duri by 38 pct, he said.     Last month contractual volumes were cut by 30 pct.     Contractual volumes assume no production ceiling.     Oil traders said Indonesian grades were already trading above their official selling prices (osp) on the spot market due to strong demand from Japan and the U.S. And tight supplies.     A cargo of Duri loading in July was reportedly traded yesterday at 70 cents over its osp of 15.60 dlrs per barrel and Minas is trading about 20 cents higher, they said.  \n',28
'The Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina has found new offshore oil and gas resources in East Aceh, on the western tip of northern Sumatra, a company spokesman said.     The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1 offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh.     \"Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300 metres within the Baong formation,\" he said.     He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow oil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at 20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke.     \"The well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mln standard cubic feet a day,\" he added.     GOS IA-1 well, located at a water depth of 41 metres, was drilled under a production sharing contract between Pertamina and Japex North Sumatra Ltd, each having 50 pct shares.     \"Petroleum operations are to be carried out by Pertamina as operator through a joint operating body established by the two companies,\" the Pertamina spokesman stated.     The contract covers the Gebang block contract area. The two companies have previously completed the drilling of GOS IIA-1 exploratory well, around 14 kms south of GOS IA-1.  \n',28
'Indonesia told the oil industry on Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased expenditure on exploration in return.     President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.     \"In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending production sharing contracts under the present laws,\" Suharto said.     \"Apart from that, the government will keep improving the investment climate in order to accelerate the development of the petroleum industry,\" he said.     Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be renewed before they would invest in further exploration.     \"As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully aware of this situation,\" Subroto said.     \"The government has already made the political decision to entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a selective basis.\"     Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil industry sources say.     Subroto said the government was also working to ease other problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or deep water conditions.     But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now that the oil price had recovered.     President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil industry for the regions in which companies operated.     Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in 1986.     Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation contracts with foreign oil companies.     Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field operations was a government priority. There had been misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry in certain areas, such as when a field is designated commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.     He said the government wanted to finalise contract extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the meantime to maintain its exploration drive.     Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire within 10 years. \"This need in itself is some sort of guarantee that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.\"     Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.     Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.     Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions would be selective, based on how much capital would be invested.  \n',28
'International LPG prices were little changed in the past week, barely affected by the excitement on the advent of OPEC\'s mid-year meeting, traders and industry sources said.     \"If the OPEC decides to increase crude oil production,\" a traders said, \"LPG supplies will be up without corresponding rise in demand.\"     Petrochemical buyers were sidelined, after their foray in the market early in june, they said.     An industry meeting in Dublin this week also drew many market participants away from the trading desk, they added.     Algeria has moved at least two cargoes of propane to the U.S. Gulf, keeping Mediterranean prices steady, traders said.     In the Mideast Gulf, propane appeared easing slightly, after a major U.S. oil company bought propane on formula which netted back about 123 dlrs, cif Mideast Gulf, which was two dlrs below Saudi Arabia\'s government selling price (gsp), industry sources said.     Delivered propane to Japan was quoted at gsp plus 19 dlrs and butane at gsp plus 25 dlrs, the traders said.  \n',28
'Iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati, here on a two-day official visit, informed cuban foreign ministry officials on monday on the tense situation in the gulf, diplomatic sources said.     They said the envoy\'s trip, to be followed from tuesday by a visit to nicaragua, could be linked to a possible mediation of the non-aligned movement in the seven-year-old iran-iraq war but they ruled out any prominent cuban role in it.     Velayati could not be reached for comment on the U.S. Attack on an abandoned iranian oil rig on monday which tehran vowed to avenge.  \n',28
'Iran\'s top war spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday called the U.S. Attacks on two of its Gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation.     \"God willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming days and make them sorry,\" said Rafsanjani in a speech to Parliament later broadcast by Tehran Radio.     The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance after the U.S. Raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed.     President Ali Khamenei, Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and now Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the U.S. Action have all vowed retaliation.     Rafsanjani, the parliamentary speaker, said, \"It is not a threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it in practice.\" He added that the American attack \"squares neither with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with security, nor reason and wisdom.\"     U.S. Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and American special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.     The U.S. Government said the attack was a measured response to an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters last Friday.  \n',28
'Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for compensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf oil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.     The lawsuits would be filed with competent international bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.     The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack, he said.     Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.     He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs \"except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence.\" Reacting to Weinberger\'s remark that Washington considered the case closed, Aqazadeh said: \"Iran will also consider the case closed after its retaliatory measure.\" Iranian officials have said their response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests around the world might come under attack.     Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region\'s oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack significantly affecting oil prices.     IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the entrance to the Gulf.     \"If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can either, and this would be to everyone\'s harm,\" the radio quoted him as saying.  \n',28
'U.S. Attacks on two Iranian oil platforms in the Gulf -- both of which were still blazing -- caused damage estimated at 500 mln dlrs, Tehran Radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.     The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack and could cause widespread pollution in the Gulf, the minister told a news conference in Tehran. He said the Reshadat rigs, 120 miles (200 km) east of Bahrain in international waters, were in the final stages of reconstruction after an attack by Iraqi jets last year.  \n',28
'Iran said several people were injured in Monday\'s U.S. Attack on an Iranian offshore oil site and vowed retaliation, Tehran radio reported.     It quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying, \"We will definitely retaliate and will not leave this American move unanswered.\"     A broadcast monitored in Nicosia said several civilian personnel on the Rashadat oil platforms in the Gulf east of Qatar were injured when U.S. Warships bombarded them this afternoon. It described damage as \"severe.\"     Washington said four American frigates shelled and destroyed two Iranian platforms at the Rashadat (formerly Rostam) field at 1100 GMT on Monday in response to Friday\'s missile attack on a U.S.-flag ship in Kuwaiti waters.     The U.S. Said Iranians used the platforms for military pruposes and had fired on an American helicopter from the rigs earlier this month.     Khamenei denied that the platforms had military gear or personnel and said the U.S. Attack lacked miltary value.     \"With this move Mr. Reagan has committed a big mistake and has definitely increased his problems...  \n',28
'The Soviet Union has agreed to supply Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels per day of crude, Iran\'s national news agency, IRNA, said.     IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.     Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.     Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.     Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he left for Moscow.     Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined products.     Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the Caspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran.  \n',28
'Iran and the Soviet Union have provisionally agreed to hold talks on a possible exchange of Iranian crude oil for finished Soviet oil products, an official spokesman said Tuesday.     Gennady Gerasimov, chief of the Soviet Foreign Ministry\'s Information Directorate, told reporters the agreement had been reached during a visit to Moscow last week by Iran\'s Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh.     Gerasimov said no date had been set for the talks, which would also study the possibility of Soviet technical assistance for Iran\'s oil industry.  \n',28
'Iranian Premier Mir-Hossein Mousavi reiterated his country would retaliate for U.S. Navy attacks on Gulf oil platforms.     \"The U.S. Attack on Iran\'s oil platforms jeopardises our national sovereignty ... And we will retaliate properly for this perfidious American aggression,\" Mousavi told a news conference in Damascus.  On Monday U.S. Navy warships blasted the Rostam platform, and Navy personnel stormed a second platform a few miles away. Washington said the operation was aimed at destroying positions used by Iran to track and assault neutral Gulf shipping.   \n',28
'Iraq has rejected its new OPEC production quota set in Vienna for the second half of this year, the official Iraqi news agency INA reported.     It quoted Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, who returned Sunday, as saying \"Iraq will continue to adhere to its position considering itself as not included in the agreement.\"      Last December, Iraq rejected its assigned first half 1987 quota of 1.466 mln bpd and demanded a share equal to the 2.255 mln bpd quota set for Iran, its enemy in the nearly seven-year-old Gulf war.     The accord reached by OPEC ministers in Vienna Saturday set an output ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd for the group\'s 13 members from July to December, raising Iraq\'s share to 1.54 mln bpd and Iran\'s to 2.369 mln.  \n',28
'Iraq said today its troops were pushing Iranian forces out of positions they had initially occupied when they launched a new offensive near the southern port of Basra early yesterday.     A High Command communique said Iraqi troops had won a significant victory and were continuing to advance.     Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km (six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three divisions attacked.     The communique said Iranian Revolutionary Guards were under assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery and tanks.     \"Our forces are continuing their advance until they purge the last foothold\" occupied by the Iranians, it said.     (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000 Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)     The Baghdad communique said Iraqi planes also destroyed oil installations at Iran\'s southwestern Ahvaz field during a raid today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot down.     Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of the Gulf. Iraqi naval units and forces defending an offshore terminal sank six Iranian out of 28 Iranian boats attempting to attack an offshore terminal, the communique said.      \n',28
'Deregulation of Japan\'s oil industry could mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.     They said the relaxation of controls was now under review by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).     A spokesman for a major firm said, \"Deregulation would bring about a reorganization. If it\'s a by-product of freer competition, we have no choice but to accept it.\"     The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.     The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.     They said deregulation was vital to promote more competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.     \"Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it\'s our turn to see if we can survive cut-throat competition,\" said a source at one major Japanese oil company.     A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, \"We\'ll have a hard time surviving, but that\'s something we must go through.\"     \"In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out further into other lines such as real estate and travel agencies,\" he said.     Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd which had the largest share of refined products sales in the Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining capacity in fiscal 1986.     Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a spokesman for the company said.     Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the efficiency of the industry.     Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to be streamlined further into five refining groups.     \"MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to merge into five to build up their muscles,\" a source said.     A MITI official tolds he did not rule out the possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry in the event of the relaxation of oil controls.     He declined to officially confirm or deny that the Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards deregulation.  \n',28
'The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese energy demand, ministry officials said.     MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600 mln, they said.     The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen and a decline in domestic electric power demand.     MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.     They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.     Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan\'s electric power in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27 pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.  \n',28
'Japan said it understood why the U.S. Attacked an Iranian oil platform on Monday.     \"Japan, deeply concerned over the increasing threat to the ships navigating in the Gulf, understands the circumstances that have led the United States government to take these measures,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.     The statement added that the threat to free and safe navigation had increased after the missile attack on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti territorial waters last Friday.  \n',28
'OPEC output for the second half of 1987, including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday, Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.     Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter target.     Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, \"OPEC third quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd\"     Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production levels would have on prices.     Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd, rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Iraq\'s export capacity will be further boosted when a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about September.     Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369 mln in the second half.     Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. \"We will not discuss it. There will not be any change,\" he said.     Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems to be adressed. \"We are overdoing it in holding too short a meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,\" he said.     Ali said the problem of price differentials between the prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly at the meeting.      Ali said \"The problem of differentials is a real one. I would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced relative to heavy crudes.\"     Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said \"If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do the work of another minister.\"     Kuwait\'s own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.     OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.          \n',28
'OPEC\'s credibility faces fresh scrutiny in coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies of oil to international oil markets, the Kuwait daily al-Qabas said.     In an article headlined \"Gulf oil sources say Middle East production up 1.4 mln bpd\" and \"Markets witness new surplus amid whispers of return to cheating days,\" it warned OPEC\'s official prices could face fresh pressure from international oil companies seeking cheaper supplies.     It did not say whether only OPEC or Opec and other producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts.    \"The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under fresh scrutiny from Monday, with activity in the European and American markets,\" it said.     The sources were quoted as saying that after Opec had in March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some members had raised output last week. It gave no details.     \"Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and producing over quotas has begun anew,\" it reported.    \"The sources warned that maybe the (price of a) barrel of oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if there is no control on supplies.     \"The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure Opec over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,\" it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift from Qatar unless it gave price discounts.     \"More than one official has warned Opec would find its solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May,\" it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer.   \n',28
'Kuwait\'s oil exports have not been affected by the seven-year Iran-Iraq war, Kuwait Oil Tanker Company (KOTC) Chairman and Managing Director Abdul Fattah al-Bader told a Kuwaiti newspaper.     \"Kuwait has exploited all available opportunities to continue exporting its oil without any reduction,\" the Al-Anbaa newspaper quoted him as saying.     He said KOTC made profits of more than two mln dinars (seven mln dlrs) in the fiscal year ending last June, but predicted lower profits this year due to higher costs for chartering and operating vessels.  \n',28
'Military experts say the United States faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a U.S.-flagged tanker.     The experts tolds Tehran holds the initiative and is likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching limited retaliatory strikes.     But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps -- such as mining Iran\'s harbors, blockading its shipping, or destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.     \"Iran is in the driver\'s seat in an absolute sense as the cycle of attack and retaliation continues,\" said Fred Axelgard, a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).     \"It\'s like a Greek tragedy,\" said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll of Washington\'s private Center for Defense Information (CDI) think tank.     Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq.     They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its 30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal  would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which President Reagan could never accept.     U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran\'s Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf time (0700 EDT) on Monday.     Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City on Friday.     Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and allowed to escape.     \"We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures,\" Weinberger said.     \"We consider this matter closed,\" he said.     Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken this view after earlier clashes.  \n',28
'The current crude oil price of between 18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.     Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government officials said.     They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third World debt and industrialised nations.     Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher energy bills for the world\'s industrial nations, Lukman said.     Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he said.     This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high prices, he added.     Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.  \n',28
'Flooding in the Red River on the Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a 24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.     \"The water is rushing by so fast that we can\'t get any divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,\" a company source said.     The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.     Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring oil which has been lost to the flood.     \"But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like to proration this pipeline, if we don\'t have to.\"     The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield Corp ARC, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group RD and Texaco Inc TX, which is the pipeline\'s operator.      Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.     July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to 19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.     Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.     Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a barrel below WTI, respectively.     Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.     He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded. The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was apparently washed away.         The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this line.     Texaco\'s Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma, which is nearby.  \n',28
'The operator of a major U.S. crude oil pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be several days before repairs are made and the system is functioning again.     Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco Inc TX, operator of the pipeline through its subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs will begin in about five days and expects it to take several more days to complete.     \"At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get the job done,\" Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to assess because of flooding on the Red River.     The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.     The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said.     Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with customers to determine their requirements.     Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the  shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices.     Monday, after Texaco confirmed that the pipeline had been closed, West Texas Intermediate crude in the spot market and on New York Mercantile Exchange\'s energy futures complex rose 20 cts a barrel.

'Malaysia\'s national oil company, Petronas, has advised the government to raise crude oil output to 540,000 barrels a day (bpd) in 1988 from a current 500,000 bpd, a senior company official said.     \"We have the capacity to produce the amount,\" Rastam Hadi, Petronas\'s Vice-President for Upstream Sector said.     The government will announce its decision on Friday when it unveils the country\'s budget. Malaysia raised output this month to current levels from 420,000 bpd after reviewing the world oil market. In May, Malaysia cut output to 420,000 bpd from 459,000 in response to a call by OPEC to boost prices.  \n',28
'Oman has granted term crude oil customers retroactive discounts from official prices of 30 to 38 cents per barrel on liftings made during February, March and April, the weekly newsletter Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said.      MEES said the price adjustments, arrived at through negotiations between the Omani oil ministry and companies concerned, are designed to compensate for the difference between market-related prices and the official price of 17.63 dlrs per barrel adopted by non-OPEC Oman since February.  \n',28
'U.S. television networks said on Monday that U.S. forces launched a retaliatory strike against Iran late Sunday, apparently attacking two Iranian offshore oil drilling platforms.     NBC News said it understood six Iranians had been pulled from the sea.     It said cautiously that U.S. forces attacked late Sunday and that two Iranian oil platforms east of Bahrain were ablaze as a result, but CBS News and other networks said flatly that U.S. forces attacked the Iranian oil platforms.     U.S. officials had been meeting on a response since Friday when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a U.S.-flagged ship.     President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a decision on the U.S. response to Friday\'s Iran attack but would not say what the decision was.     Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Saturday the attack on a U.S.-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday was almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile.  \n',28
'Norway\'s September oil output rose by 22.2 pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in August, according to a survey of firms operating here.     Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at several of Norway\'s biggest fields and resumed production at fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field rescue project.     Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway\'s voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.     Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.     Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.     The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August, field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.     Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.     BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.     Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company said.     September production was also sharply higher at the Statfjord field. Norway\'s 84 pct share of Statfjord, which extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.     Norway\'s 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.     Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd in September, compared with 100,188 in August.     Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in August.     Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on stream a second well, cutting September production to just two days.  \n',28
'Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15 until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle tolds.     \"We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,\" he said. \"The accord reached there means stability in the oil market and we shall continue making our contribution.\"     The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle said. The ministry had written to Norway\'s oil companies and would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.     OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.     OPEC\'s first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and it\'s December pact had provisionally set a third quarter ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth quarter.     Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained within its December accord on output and prices.     Norway\'s oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around 840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.     The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since February reduced Norway\'s oil output by about 80,000 bpd.     Norway\'s Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement on the latest oil production cutbacks.     Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC\'s bid to keep prices stable.     Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around 18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.     Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price during the first half of 1986.     But firmer oil prices since then have brought some stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade deficit.      Norway\'s North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.  \n',28
'OPEC has shown itself to be in control of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.     They said market respect for the cartel has increased since it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.     \"There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in effect putting pressure on end-users,\" a European crude oil trader said.     In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, \"There\'s no reason to expect a weak market from now on.\"     A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, \"We thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter production so the market will react very bullishly.\"     Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.     August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday\'s 17.15-20 range, but still below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.     Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP\'s. Singapore traders said sellers might now aim for GSP\'s at least.     They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.     They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter requirements before October.     Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.     \"There\'s no doubt consumption will be higher than production by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,\" said an international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less bullish, \"For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on how much they (OPEC members) cheat.\"     A Singapore trade source said, \"There is enough cheating and leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is no need to worry about shortages.\"     Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level, after Iraq\'s rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish factor to be considered.     Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.     Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates quiet on minimal buying interest.     Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and tight prompt supplies, dealers said.  \n',28
'Some OPEC states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.     They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive.     There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes, to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.     But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in OPEC\'s new unity.     \"All OPEC members can make a good case for changing differentials,\" said one analyst with a major oil company. \"But at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be \"leave well alone\' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.\"     Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases, marketing incentives have helped their sales.     Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a \"package.\"     Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers.     OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.     Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials, analysts say.     The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest. Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.     Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at official prices, with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.     Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year, when some producers\' output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices.    Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude -- now OPEC\'s highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel -- was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain\'s Brent.     In February and March, Nigeria\'s production shrank below its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived, due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has risen.     Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.     But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London\'s Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the differentials question in Vienna.     \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which holds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.  \n',28
'OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman said he expects next week\'s ministerial meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC\'s current price and production agreement may only need a slight review.     \"I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm,\" Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, told reporters here ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, which starts June 25.     \"We already have an agreement which may need only a slight review,\" Lukman said.     The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers in December last year pegged the group\'s crude oil output at 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement to keep the market stable.     \"I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to strengthen the gains we have made so far,\" Lukman said.     He declined to say if the current ceiling should be maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December.     \"Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our collective will to keep the market strong,\" he said.     He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeks ago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and this was significant for its members.     Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year when OPEC\'s fixed price regime came into effect and a restocking now for the winter was responsible for current market strength.  \n',28
'Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas lease sale number 97 in the Beaufort Sea, tentatively schedualed for January 1988 has been postponed, the U.S. Department of Interior said.     Alan Powers, chief of the Minerals Maanagement Service for the department, said the delay is to have more time to study the effects of drilling noise on whale migrations.     Powers said the state has asked for additional noise data for the sale area off Alaska\'s North Slope. A new date has not been set, but it will likely be no sooner than next March, Powers said.     Some 3,930 blocks encompassing about 21 mln acres are involved in the proposed sale. The area is between three and 160 miles off the northern coast of Alaska in the Artic Ocean between the Canadian border and 162 degrees west longitude.  \n',28
'Crude oil prices could remain around 18 dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC\'s decision on output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an official of Mexico\'s state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.     Adrian Lajous, Pemex\' executive vice president of international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter. \"Production is surging ahead of what was originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged a few months ago,\" he said.     He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the 18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been envisaged might soften price levels.     The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.     \"I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in terms of volume decisions,\" Lajous said.     A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is always there as a possibility, he said.     \"I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and discipline will be maintained,\" he said.     Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during 1987 if output remains under control.     He said Saudi King Fahd\'s remarks last month, that increased production was not so important as long as incomes would not be affected by the output, were \"very relevant and welcome from such a powerful producer.\"  \n',28
'U.S. oil demand as measured by products supplied fell 2.6 pct in the four weeks ended April three to 15.73 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 16.16 mln in the same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.     In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was off 7.9 pct in the period to 2.90 mln bpd from 3.15 mln a year earlier.     Gasoline demand averaged 6.76 mln bpd, off 3.1 pct from 6.98 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.15 mln bpd, off 16.9 pct from 1.39 mln, the EIA said.     So far this year, distillate demand fell 2.3 pct to 3.20 mln bpd from 3.28 mln in 1986, gasoline demand was 6.63 mln bpd, off 0.3 pct from 6.65 mln, and residual fuel demand fell 4.9 pct to 1.35 mln bpd from 1.42 mln, the EIA said.     Year-to-date domestic crude output was estimated at 8.40 mln bpd, off 7.6 pct from 9.09 mln a year ago, while gross crude imports averaged 3.92 mln bpd, up 27.1 pct from 3.08 mln, it said.  \n',28
'Santos Ltd STOS.S said it had made a significant oil discovery at its Mawson One well in the Moomba block of the Cooper Basin, South Australia.     It said the well flowed oil from sands at an average rate of 1,440 barrels per day from 2,131 to 2,135 metres through a 6mm choke.     Santos said the well was cased and suspended pending further evaluation. But it said the proximity of the discovery to existing production facilities at the Gidgealpa South field would allow Mawson One to be brought into production rapidly.

'Saudi Arabia\'s Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said Riyadh would not agree to a cut in oil prices and would not accept a \"mad\" increase that would drive consumers away.     He told al-Riyadh newspaper, \"Saudi Arabia follows a balanced petroleum policy. It does not approve of a decrease in prices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and find alternative sources (for energy).\"     OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world prices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing system aimed to stabilize the market around 18 dlrs a barrel.      OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25, where it will review its current oil price and production policy.     Saudi Arabia\'s King Fahd said last month that he wanted oil prices to remain stable for the next two years.     Saudi Arabia is the architect of the current pricing and production pact, which is backed by Kuwait and the UAE. The current pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of 15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs a barrel average.   \n',28
'Saudi Arabia hopes to increase the volume of its oil exports to Japan through expanding bilateral trade, Saudi Arabian Interior Minister Naif bin Abdul-Aziz said.     He told a Tokyo reception his country hopes to raise crude and products exports to Japan to earlier levels, but did not elaborate. To promote trade, Saudi Arabia is inviting Japanese industries to do business there, he said.

'The acting governor of Saudi Arabia\'s state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.     They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.     Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher, left in a major oil industry shake up last December.     The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the post permanently.     The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers\' oil market.     The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20 years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.     Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel last December.     Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia does business, the sources said.     The sources had said possible candidates for the governor\'s job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia\'s University of Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi, Ahmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah Islamic Port.  \n',28
'Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according to the kingdom\'s main producing company, Aramco.     Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167 billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985, while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft from 126.1 trillion, the company\'s annual report said.     Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.      Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the organisation decided to cut production again from last September onwards.     Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.     Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the official Saudi Press Agency.     The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.      Aramco\'s only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44 mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the report said.     The country\'s other five, smaller refineries -- owned by another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced around 750,000 bpd last year.      Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from 998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes per day, the report said.     Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4 billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.   \n',28
'Saudi Arabia\'s renegotiation of its collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the latter\'s ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry sources said.     Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday\'s edition, said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34 mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and volumes and other terms may be rearranged.     The agreement signed in January for the months from February to June is up for renegotiation.     Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp XON 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc TX 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp MOB and Chevron Corp CHV 550,000 bpd between them.     But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its obligations under the contract     PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective agrement.     John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate schedule although separate agreements with the companies would favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted liftings occur .     \"The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long haul,\" he said.     Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely concentrate on volume rather than price.     Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were being sought, a fact later confirmed bys with Aramco.     Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp CHV, Exxon Corp XON, Mobil Corp MOB and Texaco Inc TX but is now owned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although the ex-partners have various agreements with Saudi Arabia.  \n',28
'The U.N. Security Council was called to a private meeting on Monday for consultations  following the United States attack on an Iranian oil platform.     Meanwhile, a U.N. spokesman said that as far as he knew a report to the council and Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar on the action had not been received from the Americans.     In Washington, President Reagan said the United Nations was being informed of the attack under the provision of the U.N. Charter regarding notification of actions taken under the right of self-defense.     The U.N. spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said Perez de Cuellar had no comment on the attack, taken in response to Iranian action against an American-owned tanker last week, but was trying to find out \"what actually happened.\"     Calls to Iran\'s U.N. commission elicited no response.  \n',28
'The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backed President Reagan\'s retaliatory strike against Iranian targets in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy in the volatile region.     Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed Monday\'s U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.     The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S. resolve that Iran \"cannot take military action against the United States with impunity.\"     Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.     While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S. retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan comply with the War Powers Act.  \n',28

'South Yemen is planning a major oil pipeline system to be completed in 18-months time to start exports at a initial rate of 100,000 barrels per day, (bpd) the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said.     MEES said government approval for the export pipeline followed a visit to Aden by a high ranking delegation from the Soviet Union, which will help South Yemen construct the line     The engineering studies for the pipeline are nearly finished and construction is expected to start early next year, the industry newsletter said.     The pipeline will run about 170-200 kms (105-125 miles) from Shabwa oilfields to a coastal terminal at Bir \'Ali on the Gulf of Aden, MEES said.      MEES said the Soviet firm Technoexport, which is developing oilfileds for South Yemen, has substantially increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity.     The discovery of commercial quaotities of oil was confirmed by Technoexport earlier this year in three structures in the Shabwa region in the Northwestern part of the country, 200 kms east of North Yemen\'s Alif oilfield.  \n',28
'The Soviet oil production target for 1988 has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over this year\'s planned output.     Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday at the Supreme Soviet, the country\'s nominal parliament.     He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation which began in late 1983.     Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil, slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.     January-September figures released at the weekend showed Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467 mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.     Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.     The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988 budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday.  \n',28
'Kuwait has agreed to charter tankers from the Soviet Union in a move to protect its oil exports through the Mideast Gulf, diplomatic sources said.     They said the agreement followed months of talks with the Soviet Union and the U.S. On ways to secure its oil exports after Iran started to attack Kuwaiti-connected vessels in retaliation for Kuwait\'s backing for Iran\'s war enemy Iraq.     Diplomats said they expect three Soviet tankers initially to reinforce other flags already supporting Kuwait\'s 22-tanker fleet.     The diplomats said they knew of no deal for Moscow to provide a naval escort for its own vessels, but \"the idea of protection is implicit,\" one said.     They said Soviet cargo ships bound for Kuwait in the past to unload arms and materiel for road delivery to Iraq were known to have sailed under escort. So far, none of the Soviet ships are known to have been attacked by Iran. Diplomats said they expected the chartered Soviet tankers to sail between Kuwait and Khor Fakkan on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) coast a short way outside the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf.  \n',28
'Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) has decided to renew its one-year contract with Abu Dhabi for 480,000 tonnes of Upper Zakum crude oil, CPC officials tolds.     They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is now awaiting its approval.     CPC\'s one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31 this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1 at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.     CPC officials also said the company agreed with the Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the government selling price.     Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through C.Itoh.     Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.     Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.     CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to offload CPC\'s needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.     CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln tonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot market compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.  \n',28
'Norwegian state oil company Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap (Statoil) signed contracts worth a total of 1.5 billion Norwegian crowns in connection with the development of the Veslefrikk oil field, Statoil said.     Moss Rosenberg Verft of Stavanger has been awarded a contract to convert the the drilling platform West Vision to a floating production platform. The work is to be completed in the summer of 1989.

'Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) STAT.OL, operator on Norway\'s North Sea Veslefrikk oil field, has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billion crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a statement.     Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier A/S KVIO.OL won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert Statoil\'s semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.     Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S AMVO.OL, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the well-head platform\'s 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.     Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several months earlier than previously planned.     Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km west of Bergen.     Statoil estimates the field\'s total development cost, including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.     Veslefrikk\'s oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from Norway\'s Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.     Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55 pct share, Unocal Norge A/S (18 pct), Deminex (Norge) A/S (13.5 pct), Norsk Hydro A/S NHY.OL (nine pct) and Svenska Petroleum AB (4.5 pct).  \n',28
'The official Soviet news agency Tass denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would bring no dividends to the Reagan administration.     Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.     \"The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that the latest military adventure will not bring political dividends to the American administration,\" Krutikhin said.     Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.     Soviet officials have previously criticized the United States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their presence serves to increase tension.     Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought broader contacts with Iran in the last year.     Krutikhin said: \"The United States has undertaken an act of armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has long been spoken of by Washington officials.\"  \n',28
'U.S. oil traders said Texaco Inc\'s filing for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code is adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, but opinions are divided on the impact to the market.     \"The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today,\" said one trader. \"Everyone is talking about it, assessing their company\'s situations in relation to Texaco,\" he added.      Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies under the bankruptcy filing.     However, others were less worried. \"The first paid will be the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the shipping industry,\" one New York trader said.     \"If Texaco doesn\'t get crude supplies it can\'t run its refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,\" he added.     Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally interferring with Pennzoil\'s proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.

Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco on an open line basis, he said.     Another trader, however, described today\'s activity as business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because no liens can be put on Texaco\'s assets while it is in bankruptcy.     Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange might lower Texaco\'s position limit and require higher margins for Texaco\'s trades.     New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden declined to comment on Texaco\'s futures trading, saying that is is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for companies that are in financial trouble.  \n',28
'Turkey said today its disputes with Greece, including rights on the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea, should be solved through negotiations.     A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute and an agreement on this issue would effect the security, economy and other rights of both countries.     \"As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be found by bilateral negotiations,\" the statement said. Greece has repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the International Court of Justice.     The two countries approached armed confrontation last month after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil.     A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to territorrial waters. \"The latest crises created an historic opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries,\" the Foreign Ministry statement said.

'The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc\'s RTZL.L RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible, the Press Association reported.     The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax Commissioners that any such provision was a capital expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible. The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of abandoning a rig.     An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible from corporation tax payable.     It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he said.     Oil analysts said that RTZ\'s assumption of liability was shared by the industry as a whole.     The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were built into the accounts, one analyst added.  \n',28

'Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000, probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.     \"I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000). Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable,\" Hodel told the Senate Energy Committee.     Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.     Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.  \n',28
'U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a second oil rig in retaliation for Friday\'s Iranian missile attack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.     President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile waterway.     Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by four U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf.     A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the Pentagon said.      Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters that the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.     The United States said both platforms were being used to keep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat attacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards.  \n',28
'William Crowe, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, predicted Iran will retaliate for the U.S. strike against its oil platform though he said Iranian options were limited.     \"They will be determined. They will not be easily deterred, and let me stress for you that our commitment there is not going to be risk free or casualty free.\"     He said the most likely Iranian response would involve terrorism or the laying of mines.     \"They obviously will look for ways that are probably more in line with the \'silent hand\' than what they have tried thus far,\" Crowe told an American Stock Exchange conference.     He declined comment on a reporter\'s query whether he favored a stronger move against Iran than that ordered by the president.     \"We carried out the operation that was decided upon and we carried it out with enthusiasm and I think it was professionally and well done,\" Crowe said.  \n',28
'The United States\' dependency on foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s, according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates.     Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977.     \"The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable,\" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.     Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990.     \"However, the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction,\" Lichtblau said.     He said that one of the government\'s negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration.     Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.     \"An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if we imposed it alone,\" Lichtblau said.     Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.     A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.     Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy.  \n',28
'U.S. crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week\'s OPEC meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session.     They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the organization\'s accord in December, have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf.     The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange\'s energy futures and in the spot market. That is its highest level since January 1986.     OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria\'s oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC\'s current price and production agreement may only need a slight review.     Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.     Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC\'s policies, prices should begin easing.     \"OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn\'t already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm,\" said John Hill, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.     OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group\'s production ceiling to 16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln barrels in the fourth quarter.     This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.     Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran, Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output.     \"And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,\" said Nauman Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.     But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.     \"The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are committed to stabilizing the market,\" said Rosario Ilacqua, analyst with L.F. Rothschild.     However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions.     Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a day and Iraq\'s pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000 barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.     Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines, producers receive less money for their oil.     \"The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,\" said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.     \"In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,\" he said.     One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.     \"The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf,\" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites.     Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the U.S. flag, with naval escorts.     \"Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,\" Knuettel said.  \n',28
'The United States invoked the right of self-defense in destroying an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf, the American delegation told the United Nations.     Lieutenant General Vernon Walters sent letters about the incident to Security Council President Maurizio Bucci, the delegate of Italy, and Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.     U.N. press secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary General had no comment on the attack, which followed his appeal last Friday for restraint in the crisis while he pursued efforts to obtain a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq.     In his explanation, Walters said the United States took defensive action in response to an Iranian attack against American ships in the Gulf.     He cited an Iranian Silkworm missile strike last Friday in Kuwait waters against the United States-flag ship Sea Isle City.     Walters said that military forces on the destroyed Iranian platform had engaged in a variety of actions against United States-flag and other nonbelligerent vessels and planes.     \"In accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations (Charter), I wish, on behalf of my government, to report that United States forces have exercised the inherent right of self-defense under internation law by taking defensive action in response to attacks by . . .

'Union Texas Petroleum said its worldwide proved reserves fell to 511 mln barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 1986 from 555 mln barrels reported in 1985.     In its newly released annual report, Union Texas said it replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of 27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves.     Union Texas, the nation\'s largest independent oil and gas producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc ALD.     The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on 1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of 165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985.     Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the company\'s total energy production is in the United Kingdom, Indonesia and Pakistan.     In the United States, Union Texas said it completed evaluation work on its oil find in Alaska\'s Colville Delta area.     \"Although significant oil reserves were confirmed, development of this discovery will not be economical without substantially higher prices,\" the company said.     Union Texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over the next two years to develop its Eugene Island Block 371 in the Gulf of Mexico.     In 1987, the company said it budgeted 178 mln dlrs for capital spending, less than half of the amount spent in 1985 and down from 199 mln dlrs budgeted last year.

'The State Department says many U.S. diplomatic missions overseas are on high alert for possible retaliation from Iran for Monday\'s attack on two Iranian oil platforms by American forces in the Gulf.     At the same time, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday that U.S. forces have begun escorting another Kuwaiti tanker convoy southward through the Gulf from Kuwait.     The State Department renewed its warning to Americans not to travel to Iran because of what spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley called, \"its virulent anti-American policies and support for terrorism.\"     \"The threat to Americans has increased significantly,\" she said in announcing that the department was reiterating advice it last made in January. The department said about 2,600 American citizens live in Iran, the overwhelming majority dual nationalities.

'U.S. military planners ruled out Iran\'s Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.     U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and raided another in what the administration called a \"measured and appropriate response\" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.     Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig rather than an onshore economic or military target such as Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at home and in the Gulf.     \"It simply demonstrated the United States will take military action when they (Iran) take military action,\" Norman Polmar, a defense analyst and author, said.     He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.     In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.     Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a Security Council call for a ceasefire.     \"We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there\'s any chance at all,\" he said, adding that the action made it clear tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.     In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran\'s economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the lower Gulf.     \"We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting capabilities,\" Cordesman said.     He predicted the United States would respond to any future major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran\'s naval base at Bandar Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the approaches to Iran\'s oil export terminal on Kharg Island.     Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, \"but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures.\"   \n',28
'Venezuela will back Ecuador\'s bid to raise its OPEC quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd) because it is a justifiable demand, Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.     He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an earthquake last March.     \"For this five-month period, Ecuador did not exercise its right to produce 221,000 bpd,\" he said. \"We should recognize Ecuador\'s right to increase its quota ... There is a basis of justice in that country\'s petition.\"     He added however, the quota increase should be gradual to avoid harming the market, he added.     Hernandez Grisanti said he understood Ecuador would formally submit the request for a higher quota at the next ministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) opening December 9 in Vienna.  \n',28

Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group\'s members were now pumping above 18 mln bpd, he told a news conference.     Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction continued.     Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were \"overproducing in an exaggerated manner\" above their assigned quotas, he said.     OPEC\'s overall ceiling is 16.6 mln bpd.  \n',28
'Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said he foresaw market stability in the price of crude, despite growing tension in the Gulf augmented by the U.S. military attack on an Iranian oil platform.     He told a news conference the market continues to be stable despite all the military action in the Gulf.  \n',28
'Oil prices would skyrocket for a time if conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oil supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.     He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military action in the Gulf.     But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian Petroleum Association, he said, \"If worst comes to worst and say the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust, can take care of the situation.\"     \"But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of the situation,\" he declared.     Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively short-term impact on prices, he added.     Assessing future price trends, he said, \"Short-term spot prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per barrel.     \"The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater than the downward ones.\"     \"The balance between supply and demand in the short term will still be delicate,\" he added. \"Non-Opec production may still go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase in world demand.\"     Subroto, a member of Opec\'s three-man quota committee which has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.     In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he said.  \n',28
