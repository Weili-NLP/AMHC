'Distillate fuel stocks held in primary storage rose by 628,000 barrels in the week ended April three to 106.96 mln barrels from a revised 106.33 mln the previous week, the American Petroleum Institute said.     In its weekly statistical bulletin, the oil industry trade group said gasoline stocks rose 2.29 mln barrels to 247.91 mln barrels from a revised 245.62 mln, and crude oil stocks were up 8.52 mln barrels to 337.73 mln from a revised 329.21 mln.     It said residual fuel stocks rose 28,000 barrels to 38.25 mln from a revised 37.98 mln barrels.     API said refinery runs in the week rose to 12.54 mln barrels per day from 12.21 mln and refinery use of operating capacity was 80.4 pct, up from 78.3 pct.     Crude oil imports in the week fell to 3.40 mln bpd from a revised 3.60 mln, API added.  \n',gas
'U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said he and a group of Republican lawmakers are considering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol tax exemption through the year 2000.     Dole, addressing the National Corn Growers Association board, said the proposal was under consideration by a rural task force of Republican members of Congress and governors.     Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives a six cents per gallon exemption from a nine cent federal excise tax. The exemption is to expire the end of 1992.     Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusiness firms including Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and A.E. Staley. The tax exemption has helped bolster ethanol production despite a sharp drop in the prices of competing crude oil.  \n',gas
'The European Community (EC) agreed tough new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and buses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vast stretches of the region\'s forests.     Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few years the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the main source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.     The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and for all new vehicles from October 1990.     The EC\'s executive Commission says the emission level of nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year from three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if all heavy vehicles applied to the new standards.     There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use in the EC, according to Commission figures.     The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn requested permission to do so to encourage the use of low-pollution cars, diplomats said.     West Germany will still need ministers\' final approval for such a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when EC environment ministers meet next on May 21.     But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germany did not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wide ban on the sale of regular leaded petrol.     Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomats said. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20 mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no damage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol.     Under EC law, ministers have to give member states special permission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition laws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implement a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol.  \n',gas

'The EC Executive Commission has backed a plan to allow member countries to ban regular leaded gasoline in a move designed to encourage use of unleaded fuel.     It said in a statement it backed a proposal to allow EC states to ban sales of regular grade gasoline containing lead at six months notice. The proposal, which needs approval by EC ministers, would not force any member state to impose the ban. \"It\'s an option, not an obligation,\" a spokesman said.     But the Commission said imposing the ban would encourage the use of unleaded fuel, as well as making it easier for gas stations by cutting the number of types of gasoline they had to stock.  \n',gas
'The Federal Trade Commission said its staff has urged the governor of Georgia to veto a bill that would prohibit petroleum refiners from owning and operating retail gasoline stations.     The proposed legislation is aimed at preventing large oil refiners and marketers from using predatory or monopolistic practices against franchised dealers.     But the FTC said fears of refiner-owned stations as part of a scheme of predatory or monopolistic practices are unfounded. It called the bill anticompetitive and warned that it would force higher gasoline prices for Georgia motorists.  \n',gas
'A new grade of unleaded gasoline now being test marketed will increase refining costs when refiners can least afford it, according to officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners Association conference here.     The new grade of unleaded gasoline has an octane level of 89 compared with over 90 for super unleaded and 87 for regular unleaded gasoline.      Amoco Corp AN has test-marketed the new mid-grade gasoline and hopes to sell it on a regular basis in the South, East and Midwest by the beginning of June, according to Paul Collier, executive vice president of marketing.     Phillips Petroleum P expects to begin marketing the new 89 octane unleaded gasoline in May, sources said.     Converting current refinery operations to produce the 89 octane unleaded gsoline could cost hundreds of millions of dollars per refinery but that depends on the present capacity and intensity of the refinery, said Amoco\'s Collier.     But not all oil company\'s welcome the introduction of another grade of unleaded gasoline.     \"Three grades are not warranted,\" said Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum CNP. \"Refiners will have to upgrade again,\" he added.     \"An investment will have to be made,\" said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, an operating subsidiary of DuPont Corp DD in order to upgrade refinery operations.  \n',gas

'Energy Secretary John Herrington said he would rule out a tax on gasoline as one option to help avert what his departmet has called the threat of increased reliance on foreign oil in the coming years.     He said at a news conference that any recommendation he would make would have to increase domestic production, not cause widespread economic hardship and have a minimal cost to the U.S. taxpayer.     On the grounds of increasing production, he said, \"I would rule out a gasoline tax.\"     Herrington also repeated he would rule out an oil import fee because of the widespread dislocation it would cause -- the loss of about 400,000 jobs nationwide due to higher oil prices and a drop in the gross national product by about 32 billion dlrs.     He said an increased depletion allowance, to 27.5 pct, on new and enhanced production of oil and natural gas would be a cheap way to spur domestic production.     He estimated this cost at about 200 mln dlrs a year.     Herrington proposed the increased depletion allowance to the White House Tuesday but the White House reaction was cool.     The White House said it would study the proposal, but was generally oppposed to altering the national tax code, just passed last year.     Herrington, asked his reaction to the White House reaction, said, \"If I were the White House, I would be cool, too.\"  \n',gas

'Abu Dhabi\'s offshore Abu al-Bukhoosh oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last November, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry sources said.     They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (Total) TPN.PA, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.     Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi, last November 25.     The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production platform.     Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq.     Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.     The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations, the sources said.     Facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources said.     Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15 mln bpd production, the sources said.     They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field, part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located only a few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air raid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked.  \n',crude

'American Petroleum Institute President Charles DiBona said no options should be rejected to combat  growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.     \"No action should be ruled out--import fees or quotas, floor prices, tax incentives or other alternatives--while a national dialogue on the issue continues,\" DiBona said at a  paper institute conference in New York today.     DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry on how to stimulate energy production but there is consensus on removing several government policies that hinder investments in new prospects.     DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished immediately and current proposals for increased environmental regulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not adopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil companies, DiBona said.     \"This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil,\" DiBona said. Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen while consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported oil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said.      \n',crude

API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with a drop in natural gas liquids production, which was off 11 pct from February 1986 levels, represented a decline in U.S. production of more than one mln barrels a day.     API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day in February, a 30.3 pct increase from last year\'s level.     So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, which was up 2.9 pct from last year\'s year-to-date level, has slowed in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of 1986.

'The government\'s over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting Australia\'s economic performance, Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.     Over one-third of Australia\'s indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.     This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the country\'s economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.     Australia\'s medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat, yet the government\'s response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry, Benbow said.     Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from 546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the Bass Strait fields, he said.     Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.     By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said.     Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.     Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years time, he said.     At present world oil prices and the current value of the Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.     Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980\'s, the addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.     For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five years 1980-84 represent about two years\' consumption, he said.     He called on the government to review its tax policies to restore incentive to exploration.  \n',crude
'Australia\'s crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.     He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government\'s economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry\'s concerns.     Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation.     Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years.     These include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on \'old\' Bass Strait oil found before September 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last September, he said.     The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and Australia\'s relatively low exploration levels.     \"While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes, which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas,\" Evans said.     He said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.     As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects.     APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.     Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more than anything on the government\'s desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules.  \n',crude
'The council of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australia\'s petroleum taxation structure.     The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government\'s position on taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.     As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum.     APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development, the council said.     It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.     Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.     \"The government\'s unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based,\" the APEA council said.     The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry\'s concerns, despite its recognition of the industry\'s problems, the council said.     The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices.  \n',crude
'A 10 percentage point reduction in the Australian government\'s maximum crude oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output, resources analyst Ian Story said here.     A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000 BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference.     Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.     Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.     The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd BRKN.S/Exxon Corp XON partnership to shut-in production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue, he said.     He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct.     \"The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs,\" Story said.     Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development, he said.     The government is currently reviewing the oil tax structure.  \n',crude

'The Emirates Industrial Bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues.     A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986.     The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).     The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December\'s OPEC accord to restrain overall group production.     These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.     \"All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,\" the study said.     It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.     The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.     It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states\' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985.

The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a result of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product from other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam, a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpd plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant.     He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation.     The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of its capacity since the end of January while an extensive overhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where the hydrocracker is sited, he said.     This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, but this is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident.     Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flare line at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13, but the spokesman said this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident.  \n',crude
'The British Petroleum Co Plc BP.L said it had no plans to close its refinery in Gothenburg, despite forecasts by a Swedish finance ministry committee that it might be planning such a move.     The committee said the refinery\'s future looked bleak because the Swedish petroleum industry\'s competitiveness was expected to worsen unless it invested, and because of the effects of a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content.     But BP said the unit, in which Sweden\'s OK Petroleum AB has a 22 pct stake, had performed well both technically and financially up to and including the first quarter of 1987.     Current restrictions on sulphur emissions and known future plans for both Sweden and export markets did not cause it any serious problems, it said in a statement.     The refinery started up in 1967 and has an annual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes.  \n',crude
'The British Petroleum BP.L Co Plc\'s refinery at Grangemouth, Scotland, shut down after an explosion and fire in the hydrocracker on March 22, will probably be back in operation towards the week-end, a refinery spokesman said.     He said the refinery will resume at about half its 178,500 barrels per day (bpd) capacity, as work on overhauling the North Side of the complex, which began at the end of January, will not be completed before the end of April.     He said the refinery had been closed for longer than originally expected due to the lengthy safety checks being carried out prior to restarting.     The explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, caused extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 hydrocracker and the spokesman said today this unit would be out of operation for several months. The remainder of the refinery, including the 19,000 catalytic cracker, was undamaged.     He said inquiries into the accident, which happened while the hydrocracker was not in operation, were continuing.     In an earlier incident, two people were killed in an explosion and fire at the refinery on March 13.  \n',crude

'Brazil\'s state-oil company, Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said.     Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil\'s decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month.     The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil consumption in Brazil.     But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment.     Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil\'s terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere.     \"Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia\'s traditional client since 1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much better for us, because with the market prices more or less the same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,\" he said.     Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing from Brazil, he said.     Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras oil stocks are \"reasonably balanced.\"      Saudi Arabia is Brazil\'s second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.     \"If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere,\" Santana added.  \n',crude

It is situated 14 kilometres from the first well to be discovered in the region last year, which is currently yielding 500,000 cubic meters of gas and 900 barrels of oil daily.

Consumption of oil derivatives totalled 1.14 mln bpd in February, 16.7 pct up on February last year but down from the record 1.22 mln bpd used in October last year.

'With troops in place in Brazil\'s ports and oil installations, the government of Prersident Jose Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of force.     Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and six areas of oil production.     The state-oil company Petrobras requested the intervention because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry employees.     The government had already dispatched more than 1,000 marines to occupy the country\'s main ports after a national seamen\'s strike was ruled illegal last Friday.     The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day, represents a stern challenge to the government.     The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil desperately needs foreign exchange.     It was a deterioration in the country\'s trade balance which precipitated Brazil\'s current debt crisis and the decision on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt.     There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen\'s strike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the most important in South America -- and the country\'s other main ports.     Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on the quays near the strike-bound ships, but the military presence here is generally discreet.     A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are out of sight.     Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, the Docemarte, seamen\'s leaders said. After explaining to the captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because the strike was illegal, the men returned to work.     One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said \"it is a psychological war. They are using force and we are using peaceful methods.\"     Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, the Docemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working.     At the seamen\'s national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are strike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports.     Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, seamen in Santos said the strikers on board ships here were not running out of food.     The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney\'s civilian government since it came to power two years ago.     Yesterday, in a separate protest, hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank interest rates.     The current rash of labour unrest in industry and agriculture stems from the failure of the government\'s now-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze.  \n',crude
'Brazilian bank workers voted to launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labour unrest arising from the failure of the government\'s anti-inflation plan.     At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of Sao Paulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24 unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met.     Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees\' 152 unions representing 700,000 workers, tolds the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks.     The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the state-owned petroleum company Petrobras.     The government ordered thousands of troops into the refineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation, but the troops were removed yesterday.     Petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal because the refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated their willingess to negotiate next Wednesday. The government has also sent marines into the main ports.     A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio de Janeiro said unions were studying an offer by private shipowners for a 120 pct pay rise.     Seamen employed by two small companies have already accepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work, as have about 5,000 seamen employed by Petrobras.     Last week also saw widespread protests by hundreds of thousands of farmers over what they see as unfairly high interest rates charged by banks.     According to official estimates, prices rose by more than 33 pct in the first two months of this year.  \n',crude
'A strike by Brazil\'s 40,000 seafarers who want pay rises of up to 180 pct may have cost the state-owned oil company Petrobras 20 mln dlrs in lost export orders, the company\'s commercial director Arthur de Carvalho was quoted as saying in press reports.     More than 170 ships in Brazil, and about nine more in foreign ports, have been halted by the strike, which began on February 27.     Marines began blockading the ships on Friday after the strike was ruled illegal, and some strikers are running short of food, National Merchants Marine Union president Edson Areias said.  \n',crude
'Brazil\'s labour troubles eased a little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing troops from the country\'s main oil installations occupied three days ago.     The troops went in at the request of the state-oil company Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil industry employees.     Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their willingness to negotiate a pay deal.     A national seamen\'s strike, however, continued and marines remained in the country\'s main ports. The marines were despatched to the ports after the seamen\'s strike, now two weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday.     A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135 in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports.     Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase.     Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a sign that the national strike could soon come to an end.     Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union leaders said the vast majority of Brazil\'s 40,000 seamen were still on strike.     The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de Janeiro next Wednesday.     Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator.     Besides industrial troubles, there has also been considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector.     On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies throughout the country to protest against high interest rates.     Television reports showed some of these protests still continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana.     The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a deterioration in its trade balance.     On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to private banks.     Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange.  \n',crude
'Britoil Plc\'s BTOL.L exploration expenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a third of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure would remain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walker said.     He told reporters following the release of the company\'s 1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986 levels.     U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from 184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from 156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in 1985.     Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to 134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary charge of 50 mln stg on the company\'s U.S. Assets. The results were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share firmed to 231p from 222p at last night\'s close. Chairman Sir Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986 had made the period extremely difficult but the company had come through remarkably well.     Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the conditions would be right for a substantially improved performance this year.     He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when they were normally weaker, made him \"a bit encouraged\" about the prospects for future levels.     Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.     Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the latter part of April.     End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared with 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this included a revised definition of reserves.     If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels previously.     Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a restated 3,660 billion. \n',crude

'Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada\'s oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said.     They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year\'s dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct.     On Canada\'s stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs.     \"This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive,\" Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said.     Financial statements from Canada\'s major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd\'s 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year\'s results, analysts said.     \"But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future,\" Gobert commented.     The Toronto Stock Exchange\'s oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986.     Among Canada\'s largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd IMO.A, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp XON, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.     Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc TXC, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc TX, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.     Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada\'s largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. \"However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher,\" analyst Plexman said.     \"Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,\" he added.     Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs.     But one industry source doesn\'t think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed.     Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn\'t believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices.     However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts.     Shell Canada and Norcen Energy Resources Ltd forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.     \"The industry\'s outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust,\" Texaco Canada said in its annual report.     \"While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely,\" Texaco Canada added.     In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year\'s lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work.     \"The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,\" Canadian Petroleum Association\'s Maciej said.     Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.     The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.     Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.     The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said.     \"For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more,\" Maciej said.    \n',crude
'Canada\'s federal government will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a company\'s oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy Minister Marcel Masse announced.     The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.     The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on or after April 1, 1987.     Masse told reporters that the government\'s oil industry aid package is aimed at small and medium sized companies.     The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.     Masse said the program will probably generate new employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.     He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil prices fell during the first half of 1986.     Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately benefit from tax benefits, he said.     The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson is now reviewing Canada\'s tax system and plans to announce tax reform proposals later this spring.     An important feature of the aid program is a decision to let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to only participating companies, he said.     Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and development, Masse said.     He told reporters his department is still considering whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for the subsidy.  \n',crude

'A Swedish Finance Ministry committee forecast that British Petroleum Plc BP.L may have to close its refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening of the Swedish petroleum industry\'s competitiveness.     It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refining business was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oil consumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content and competition from Norway\'s Mongstad facility of Den Norske Stats Olieselskab (Statoil) STAT.OL when its expansion is completed in the 1990s.     The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks a de-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unless costly investments were made to enhance the facility\'s capacity to refine a broader range of products.     But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had in recent years been above that of the European refining industry on average.

April heating oil was 1.47 cts higher to 47.91 cts a gallon.     \"Most traders expected follow through profit-taking from yesterday but the market found suport from bullish reports that OPEC is producing within its quota,\" said Simon Greenshields, a vice president with Morgan Stanley and Co Inc.     News today, including OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman statement that OPEC February production did not exceed its official quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day, helped bouy prices, traders said. A survey found OPEC production in early March was 14.7 mln bpd.     In addition to short-covering, heating oil found support from traders buying it against sales of gasoline and crude, as well as from expectations for continued drawdowns in stocks as refiners shut down for maintenance, traders said.     Unleaded gasoline for April finished 0.55 cent higher to 51.24 cts a gallon.  \n',crude
'Cooperative Energy Development Corp said two exploratory oil wells in the Zama area of Alberta tested 1,020 and 950 barrels a day, and will increase the company\'s daily oil production by 30 pct.     The company did not immediately elaborate on total production figures.     The wells, flowing oil from the Keg River formation, will be constrained to combined production of about 450 barrels a day to optimize reserve recovery, the company said.

'Crude oil netback values in complex refineries rose slightly in the U.S. and the Mediterranean  last Friday from the previous week but were lower elsewhere, according to calculations bys Pipeline.     The soft tone to refining margins reflects large worldwide stocks of petroleum products and thin trading activity, traders said.     In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by as much as 26 cts a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, an increase of 1.4 pct from the previous Friday, while sour crudes, such as Alaska North Slope, were up one pct.     In the Mediterranean, netback values were up 17 cts to 22 cts a barrel, with Arab Light up 17 cts a barrel to 18.62 dlrs, a 0.9 pct increase from the previous Friday and Urals were up 22 cts a barrel to 19.16 dlrs, a 1.2 pct increase.

'U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18  dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall.     \"OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers,\" said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. \"That could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher,\" he added.     The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to 18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.     The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a barrel.     \"Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its 15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come under question,\" McKinley said.     Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year.     IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes, or about 74 days consumption.     Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking.     Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price.     \"This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),\" the general trading manager of an international oil company tolds in a telephone interview.     For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output, traders said. A survey estimates OPEC output to be 14.7 mln bpd this week.     Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.     \"This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues, the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there,\" McKinley said.     International oil traders said that other short-haul crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available Mideast crudes earlier this week.     If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading managers at several companies tolds.     But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.     Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity Management, said OPEC production was lower \"because of the Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\"      He added, \"The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,\" he added.     There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.     Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of 18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.     Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.     \"There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government deals, which are below official prices and this is probably being resold,\" one international trader said.  \n',crude
'Diamond Shamrock Corp said that effective today it had cut its contract prices for crude oil by 1.50 dlrs a barrel.     The reduction brings its posted price for West Texas Intermediate to 16.00 dlrs a barrel, the copany said.     \"The price reduction today was made in the light of falling oil product prices and a weak crude oil market,\" a company spokeswoman said.     Diamond is the latest in a line of U.S. oil companies that have cut its contract, or posted, prices over the last two days citing weak oil markets.  \n',crude
'The U.S. Congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.     \"The industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,\" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S. Congress on energy issues.     Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.     Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed.     Herrington said, \"I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day (addition) to U.S. production.\" U.S. oil output was off to 8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last year, the American Petroleum Institute said.     Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be unlikey for the near term.     Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that \"even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we\'ve only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for the year.\"     Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.     John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to Congress said \"The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil prices and U.S. government policy.\"     Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time.     \"Lowering the producing industry\'s tax burden would probably be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but would not raise energy costs.\" Lichtblau said.     But the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee.     Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said, \"The members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our nation.\" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil service companies.     The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff uphill battle.     Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.      At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests.     But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise.     Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements \"is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action.\"      But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, \"a 50 pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.     In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.  \n',crude
'Energy Secretary John Herrington said he believes the Reagan Administration will review its decision to cut the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because of a department report issued yesterday warning of growing U.S. dependence on oil imports.     \"As part of this study, I think the Administration will take the fill rate under review,\" Herrington said at a House Energy subcommittee hearing.     The Administration has proposed cutting the fill rate from 75,000 barrels of oil per day to 35,000 bpd in fiscal year 1988 to save money.     \"My personal feeling is that is too low. I favor the maximum fill rate (of 100,000 bpd),\" Herrington said.  \n',crude
'Energy Secretary John Herrington said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration.     \"These options boost production, while avoiding the huge costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,\" Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. \"It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review.\"     \"The goal of the Administration policies is to increase domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day,\" he said.

'Tonight\'s American Petroleum Institute oil inventory report is expected to show another drawdown in distillate stocks of between two and 7.5 mln barrels for the week ending March 20, oil analysts and traders said.     They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depleted by about one to four mln barrels.     Analysts were divided on the crude stocks. Some saw stocks unchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher. Others said stocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughput volumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher or lower than the week ended March 13, traders said.     The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S. distillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another  draw reflecting historic seasonal trends.     For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocks down 2.9 mln barrels.     Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels said they are looking for fairly high consumption rates as the spring and summer driving season gets underway this year, because retail prices are still low compared to recent years.     U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrels for the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over the outcome for last week because there is uncertainty about whether throughput levels increased or decreased last week.     Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels higher, while others think inventories could be as much as five mln barrels below the previous week.     The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude runs increased and imports fell.     The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the week ended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly up or down for the week ended March 20.     Expectations for product stockdraws are already being reflected in firmer prices, traders said. But if draws are at the higher end of the estimated range, they added, the effect will be bullish. Any stockbuild would be a negative factor, they said.     Crude runs normally increase in March, and any decrease in runs would be friendly to the market, said Peter Beutel of Elders Energy Futures Inc.  \n',crude
'OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a survey shows.     The figures were polled bys correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.     They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.     OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.     The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals.     But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran\"s inability to export as much as its quota allows.     Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.     Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.     Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.     Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March.     Qatar\'s February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.     Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar\"s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.     Nigeria\'s early March output was about one mln bpd, down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.     Industry sources say Nigeria\'s customers believe its Bonny grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes from the U.K. North Sea.

'Higher world oil prices, coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia\'s economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits, bankers and diplomats said.     The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector.     Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.     But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long.     Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC\'s newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.     Oil Minister Hisham Nazer tolds output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi Arabia\'s OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.     King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC\'s new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom\'s need to secure a stable source of income for its economy.     Saudi Arabia, still the world\'s largest oil exporter, is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.     Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.     \"Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects,\" a diplomat said.     In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.     But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term.     It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy.     Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to \"tough it out\" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves.     The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out.     Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year.     \"It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy,\" he said.     Reserves were built up during the late 1970\'s and early 1980\'s when Saudi Arabia\'s breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary.     The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom\'s private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.     Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced, markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.     The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.     Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation\'s industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.     Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit.     As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector, one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.  \n',crude
'OPEC member Ecuador adopted austerity measures to conserve fuel after oil production was paralyzed by a strong earthquake.     Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced on television the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct. A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinite suspension of crude oil exports, declaring force majeure.     Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a television interviewer that it could possibly take more than a month to repair Ecuador\'s main pipeline linking Amazon basin oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast.     The quake on Thursday, which registered six on the 12-point Mercalli scale, killed at least six people and was centred near the Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito.     Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day.     The government\'s austerity measures ban the sale of aviation fuel to foreign airliners on international routes and no fuel will be available for ships owned by foreign lines.     Ecuador also banned the sale of petrol on weekends and holidays and limited sales on weekdays, an Energy and Mines Ministry communique said.  \n',crude
'Construction workers today began building a 26 km (16 mile) pipeline to link Ecuador\'s jungle oilfields to a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude could be pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitry officials said.     They said it would take about two months and at least 15 mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia\'s Pacific Ocean coast.     The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said.     The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about 17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean energy ministry official said.     The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic demand.     The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an  earthquake the night before.     The tremor ruptured the country\'s main pipeline from jungle oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific Ocean.     Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the earthquake. It would take about five months to repair the pipeline to Balao, government officials said.     Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mln dlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake, energy ministry Javier Espinosa said.      \n',crude
'Ecuador needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to its oil export pipeline caused by last week\"s earthquake, which will stop crude exports for five months, energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said.     Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc TX.N and a Mexican and an Argentine firm.     President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports for four months due to the quake.     Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of Ecuador\'s total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues.     Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired.     The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a 180-day period.     He added the Caracas-based Andean Development Corp had granted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline, 50 km of which had been damaged in the quake.     In Quito, Foreign Minister Rafael Garcia Velasco yesterday summoned ambassadors from about 40 countries to whom he issued appeal for emergency aid for the country.

'Ecuador\'s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on further Venezuelan assistance to his country\'s oil industry following last week\'s earthquake, officials said.     Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports.     Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after 180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs.     The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador\'s entire OPEC quota, set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987.     \"All options are open at this moment in the context of cooperation on oil production,\" a Venezuelan energy and mines ministry source said.     Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the pipeline is repaired, officials said.     Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at technical level, officials said.     Industry sources said that among the options are for Venezuela to produce Ecuador\'s entire quota, or for Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply Ecuador\'s Far Eastern clients.     But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made in due course.     Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired.     Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake.  \n',crude
'The Andean Development Corp (CAF) said today it is lending 11.7 mln dlrs to Ecuador to help repair 25 miles of oil pipeline destroyed by an earthquake earlier this month.     the loan was signed here today in the offices of the caracas based caf by the corporation\'s president, galo montano perez and ecuadorean ambassador antonio parra gil.     the loan had originally been intended to finance an expansion of the pipeline, but following the earthquake the ecuadorean government asked for the terms to be changed so as to permit their use in reconstruction.     Ecuador expects oil production to be suspended for four months as a result of the damage, and has asked Venezuela to help by supplying 50,000 barrels per day while the pipeline is repaired.

'up to 300 people were feared dead and more than 15,000 people left homeless by thursday\'s earthquake, which will cost Ecuador close to 800 mln dlrs in lost petroleum revenues, authorities said.     They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipeline at 150 mln dlrs.     \"the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake is gigantic,\" president leon febres cordero said after inspecting the damages in napo, the hardest-hit jungle province, 100 miles from here.     The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing this opec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, president febres cordero said in a statement issued today by the presidential press office.     The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crude exports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. It would cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carries oil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacific ocean port.     Crude traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of ecuador\'s exports.     the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico river which burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napo province, health minister jorge brancho tolds.     \"we fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there is no way of now knowing the exact figure because many people have disappeared,\" he said.

Ecuador said on Friday that last week\'s earthquake was forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt.     \"All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour,\" the president said during a visit to the quake zone. \"A government as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain.\"     Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.     He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17 dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.     Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the earthquake, which killed at least 300 people.     Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet, would be reduced.

'The suspension of Ecuador\'s crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.     The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, tolds. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.     The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues.     Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.     However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build.     Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month\'s imports.     It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country\'s total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America.     In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.     Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said.

'Energy analyst Edward Krapels said the United States should consider an oil tariff to keep U.S. dependence on imports below 50 pct.     \"On the supply side, the argument in favor of a contingent, variable import tariff is most persuasive,\" Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis, Inc said in a statement at a House Energy and Power subcommittee hearing.     \"An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the international price of crude oil falls below, say, 15 dlrs a barrel. On the demand side, the obvious policy is an excise tax on transportation fuels,\" Krapels said.     But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with the oil tariff proposal, saying Congress should remove price controls on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax incentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserve exisiting tax incentives for drilling.

'Development of costly shale oil, liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels, halted in recent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies, will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs a barrel, an Exxon Co USA executive said.     Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, tolds after addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, \"By early in the next century, synthetics should play a significant role in this country\'s energy supply.\"     McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range.     \"You\'re talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil prices, but I think that time is coming and we\'ve got to be prepared,\" McMillan said.     He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct annually in the next few years while the nation fails to replace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn of the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher because of declining supplies, McMillan said.     Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help spur development of synthetic fuels.     The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that of all the world\'s known oil reserves.     \"We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels competitive later,\" Hall said. The average lead time for development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between five and ten years.     Until last year, the federal government had subsidized synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a research program created during the Carter Administration with the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels of oil.     The corporation was shut down last April when Congress refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.  \n',crude
'World governments should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the price of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp XON director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said.     Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference.     It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact, he said.     McIvor said 37 of the world\'s 30,000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.     Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.     He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.     More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the Middle East, he said.     McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability.     \"It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of acreage for exploration,\" he said.     Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum, he added.  \n',crude

A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential clash.     Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.     The Greek government later withdrew Friday\'s request to Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea Makri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which had prompted it to make the request were no longer valid.     Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its national interests are threatened.     The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.     Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled. Athens says it considers the accord inactive.     The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined comment on the statement.     Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague.

The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a day.     Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints.

'Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency said.     Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by around one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day, the IEA said in its latest monthly report.     Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year\'s 3.6 pct.     The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.     If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.     IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same as at the begining of the year.     The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks.     Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender 1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.     The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.     Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.     Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption.     The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in March.     And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said.     As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.     World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.     This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally Planned Economies, the IEA said.     Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.     A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.  \n',crude
'OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter 1986, the International Energy Agency said.     A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest monthly oil market report.     These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to fixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for fixed volumes over an extended period.

Contracts for Saudi crude have been signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required liftings.     The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on Iranian export facilities allowed Iran\'s output to reach 2.2 mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices apparently cut February production.     It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and 0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd.     The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and 47.0 mln in the fourth quarter.     The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids (ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other developing countries\' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal) and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains.     Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record 1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected in February in accordance with government curtailments of approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC.  \n',crude
'Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.     Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report.     Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year\'s 3.6 pct, it said.     The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels.     IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.     The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks.     It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.     It is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.     Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period.     The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, the IEA noted.     Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.     Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption.     World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.     This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.     Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.     A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.     Saudi Arabia\"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.  \n',crude

'Indonesia has minimised the economic impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said.     Indonesia was badly hit by last year\'s steep plunge in crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half.     But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the previous year.     Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said, although he did not give complete figures.     The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber, palm oil, tin, timber and coffee.     Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against the dollar, which increased Indonesia\'s debt repayments.     He said the economy would have suffered more from the world economic recession if the government had not devalued the rupiah by 31 pct last September.     In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post said the government must press ahead with measures to deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports.     The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were needed to finance not only imports but also the country\'s growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs.     \"About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due within the next three to five years and will steadily increase the debt servicing burden,\" the paper said.     However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in expectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealers said.     Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar\'s nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate rebound to halt further dollar depreciation.     A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this afternoon were taken favourably by the market.  \n',crude
'Negotiations between Indonesia\'s state oil company Pertamina and foreign oil contractors on extension of the standard 30-year production sharing contract will be concluded by the end of this month, a Pertamina official said.     Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertamina\'s foreign contractors coordinating board, gave no details about the outcome of the talks.     But Pertamina President Abdul Rachman Ramly has said priority will be given to extending contracts for companies whose exploration and production contracts expire within the next seven to 10 years.     Jukardi, speaking to Indonesian reporters, said the negotiations would determine whether the 85-15 production sharing split in favour of Pertamina would be adhered to or altered in some cases as oil companies are asking for.     Hardjoko Seputro, spokesman for the Mines and Energy Ministry, has said that President Suharto has agreed in principle to extension of the standard 30-year production sharing contract to reflect better current depressed conditions on the international oil market.  \n',crude
'Indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.     To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year\"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September.     But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto\"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy.     \"(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,\" the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia\"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country\"s general economic performance.     It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, \"there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.\"     \"This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,\" the report says.     Indonesia\"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.     Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports.     The report says Indonesia\"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. \"This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s,\" the report notes.     Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April.     But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. \"For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.\"     \"Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture,\" the report states.     Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs.     A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.  \n',crude
'Iran said reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned the U.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region.     Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by \"a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world.\"      U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.     The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.     U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship \"Silkworm\" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before.     The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were \"misleading propaganda.\"     He said Iraq\'s President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use \"all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension.\"     Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. \"We are fully prepared to do what\'s necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway.\"     \"We aren\'t going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area,\" he said.

'Japanese customers have bought nearly six mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese traders involved in the transactions tolds.     NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese customers with different formulas. One company has bought 800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of 30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.     Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.      Iran\'s discounted sales have not, however, managed to reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot markets, oil traders said.     Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC\'s February output was below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.     Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market are supporting spot price levels, they said.      Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a discount, the sources said. \"It\'s just disguised cheating,\" one Japanese trader said.     The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in Singapore.

'Iraq said today its warplnes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends.     The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.     It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran\'s failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday.     A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran\'s Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time.     The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January.

Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying: \"None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.\"     He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation.     Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December.     They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.     \"This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,\" the minister said.     Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.     \"If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,\" he said.     He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel.     Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel.     Sheikh Ali also delivered \"a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.\"     Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.     However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added.     He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC\"s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body\"s members.     Ecuador\"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec\"s pricing committee.     Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: \"We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April.\" But he expected the situation would later improve.  \n',crude
'Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said OPEC was producing well below its oil output ceiling and this would help prices move higher, according to a Kuwaiti newspaper interview.     The al-Rai al-Aam newspaper quoted him as saying OPEC was pumping 2.4 mln barrels per day (bpd) less than its 15.8 mln bpd ceiling, while consumers were drawing down their petroleum stocks at a rate of 4.5 mln bpd.     As long as OPEC maintains its output curbs, demand for its oil will rise in April and May, Sheikh Ali said, adding that Kuwait was strongly committed to its OPEC quota.  \n',crude
'Five regional oil producing nations will gather in Caracas tommorrow for a two-day meeting expected to center on ways to combat proposals for a U.S. tax on imported petroleum, the Venezuela\'s ministry of energy and mines said.     Oil ministers from Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, Ecuador and Venezuela will be on hand for the fifth meeting of the informal group of Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Exporters, formed in 1983, it said. Colombia will also attend for the first time, as an observer nation, the ministry said.     Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said the conference has no set agenda but one entire session Friday will be devoted to proposals for a tax on imported oil.     Two of the group\'s members, Venezuela and Mexico, are second and third largest foreign suppliers of oil to the United States, respectively, following Canada.     Venezuela, concerned about the effect such a tax would have on its exports, undertook a diplomatic push to coordinate strategy against such measures. In February, Canadian Energy Minister Marcel Masse was invited to Caracas for talks with Hernandez on proposals for an oil import tax.  \n',crude
'Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland Revenue said in a post-budget statement.     Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).     To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was not immediately available against other development expenditure, the statement said.     The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.     Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT liability.     This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred, to be allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland Revenue said.     This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs, it said.     In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year, it calculated.     The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.     These included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation.     Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the so-called \"ring fence\" of activities in the U.K. And its continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in November, it said.     Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.     He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.     Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged, he said.     Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.     He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin.     This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.     He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year.  \n',crude
'U.S. refiners will have to reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, said industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting here.      \"If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second quarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of petroluem products at Conoco Inc     \"If not, the industry will have a tough 1987,\" he added.      Last week\'s American Petroleum Institute report said that U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity, with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week ended March 20.      The API said that with the higher crude oil runs,  distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2 mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7 mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year\'s level, the API said.      Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp CNP tolds that unless refining and marketing return to profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings.      \"The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it continues,\" said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of refining and marketing at Total Petroleum Co, a U.S. subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France.      Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given the current level of demand but the operating level should increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter, Buckler said.      Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S. refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude per day. \"I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries over the next five years,\" he said, adding that these facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The API said U.S. operations have the capacity to refine 15.6 mln bpd of crude.  \n',crude
'Madagascar extended its oil exploration agreement with the U.S. Firm Amoco Corp AN for 17 months to allow for further studies of the Morondava basin on the southwest coast, a government statement said.     It said the existing five-year agreement, due to expire this July 24, was extended until the end of 1988 to allow for additional geological and geophysical studies.     Amoco has so far laid 7,100 km of seismic lines and sunk five exploration wells in the Morondava basin. It may drill a further three wells before the end of the extended exploration period, the statement said.     Madagascar has signed oil exploration agreements with four foreign oil companies since 1981. But despite promising indications of large reserves, no commercial production plans have yet been announced.     The foreign firms - Amoco, Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY, Mobil Corp MOB and a unit of Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi - are working in partnership with the National Military Office for Strategic Industries (OMNIS).     Roland Ratsimandresy, the director general of OMNIS, said at a ceremenony to sign the extension of the Amoco agreement that his department would intensify oil exploration with its existing partners and would soon offer a new round of exploration licences.  \n',crude
'Malaysia\'s state oil company Petronas will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May 1, trade sources said.     Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986\'s target level.     Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its 10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.     However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report that Malaysia\'s crude oil output was expected to rise to an average 510,000 bpd in 1987.     The ministry\'s forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit further production cutbacks, the sources said.     Malaysia\'s benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said.     Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced Indonesian and Chinese crude output.     The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said.     In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month for sale through tender, the sources said.     However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the reduced scale of production, they said. \n',crude

'OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated.     A landslide breached Iraq\'s one mln bpd pipeline through Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.     MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.     MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of its total production into floating storage.     Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer tolds and the television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output, including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd.     The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower than that.     It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a further 25,000 bpd of \"purchase crude.\"     It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only 2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift at official prices.     MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member countries calling for the formation of a committee to study what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among various members.     The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was having difficulty selling crude at official prices.     The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC price regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and \"other forms of hydrocarbons\" which are marketed in package deals with crude oil.  \n',crude

'mexico\'s proven reserves of liquid hydrocarbons at end-1986 were 70 billion barrels, slightly down from 70.9 billion a year ago and 71.75 billion in 1984, the state oil company petroleos mexicanos (pemex) announced.     Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974, rose sharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72 billion in both 1981 and 1982.     In its annual report, pemex said average crude output in 1986 was 2.43 mln barrels per day, 202,000 bpd down on 1985. Average exports were 1.29 mln bpd, down from 1.44 mln bpd.     The company did not say what percentage of hydrocarbons was crude oil, but has previouly said it was about 48 pct.     Natural gas output in 1986 was 3.43 billion cubic feet per day, down from 3.6 billion in 1985.     Due mainly to the fall in oil prices to around 12 dlrs from 25 dlrs in the year, 58 wells, both exploratory and production, were suspended, 38 of them in less productive areas than the offshore campeche fields which accounted for 64 pct of production.  \n',crude

'Selm-Societa Energia Montedison is to close its Priolo crude refining units from March 15th to March 28th for maintenance, a company spokesman said.     Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at 140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd.     Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have been rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude.      Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the  shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said.     Garrone\'s refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) is due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the jointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity 220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th following its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman said.     The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said.     In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de BP\'s Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is 181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pct capacity, a company spokesman said.     Shell Francaise\'s Berre l\'Etang refinery will shut down in early April until mid-June, a company spokesman said. Capacity is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR) will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early April, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, a company spokesman said. Current capacity is 136,000 bbl/day.     Despite current bullish sentiment in the Med, however, traders noted that crude netbacks are beginning to look more attractive, and most maintenance shutdowns should be finished in two to three weeks.     As a result, oil industry sources suggest that the situation may ease by mid-April.  \n',crude
'Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC\'s official levels, industry sources said.     They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs.     Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.     The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.     They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices.     \"If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,\" one Japanese refiner said.     \"We don\'t intend to put pressure on them,\" he added.     Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower, oil traders said.     They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices. Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is likely to recur in April, adding to that country\'s surplus.     The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC\'s December production agreement, while agreeing to the fixed prices.     But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter.     They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea\'s Brent blend.     One Japanese refiner said, \"At the moment there\'s a lot of pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out there will be no problem, and I\'m beginning to trust their ability.\"     Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, \"Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.\"     He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude.     A Japanese refiner said, \"The European and U.S. Markets are beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky.\" \n',crude

'Higher crude oil prices will raise demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.     The analysts said that these efforts will be most successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large and growing energy requirements.     \"Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual fuel industry last year,\" Michael Smolinski, an energy economist with Data Resources Inc, tolds.     An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said.      Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected 2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive, Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American Gas Association said.     The average delivered prices at the end of January were 2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.     \"We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and third quarter (1987),\" he said.     In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas, Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp. in New York noted.     Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this spring freeing gas for spot sales.     These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last year.     AGA\'s German contended that despite the drilling decline, much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.     Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986 to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not go away until 1990.     Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote.  \n',crude
'New England Electric System NES expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs this year, up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986, the utility said in material distributed at an analysts meeting.     It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in 1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989.     The utility said these totals exclude spending on New England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project.     The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission lines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.     New England Electric said internally generated funds will cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and 65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan to spend in 1987.     The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on its oil and gas activities this year, adding internally generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.     New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year as well.     The company said it does not plan to offer common shares this year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.     President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the construction spending projection is based on the expectation that demand for electricity in the New England electric system will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.     However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for sharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2 pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.     He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices and a strong New England economy.     Huntington said New England Elecetric has \"all but rejected new coal fired plants\" to supply additional power.     He said the most attractive new power supplies are those with short lead times which can be built in modules.     Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is looking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply most of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired fluidized bed units.     He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in modular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal.  \n',crude

He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.     The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer\'s is five mln, the spokesman added.     Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.     Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close one of its French refineries.  \n',crude
'Norwegian oil companies Norsk Hydro A/S NHY.OL and Saga Petroleum A/S SAGO.OL said they have applied for offshore exploration drilling licenses in Gabon on Africa\'s west coast.     Saga Petroleum said it has applied for a 35 pct share and operatorship on one block, adding Finnish oil company Neste NEOY.HE(25 pct), Spain\'s Hispanoil (25 pct), and the World Bank\'s International Finance Corporation (IFS) (15 pct) have joined Saga to fill remaining shares in the application.     Saga spokesman Roy Halvorsen tolds he expected Gabonese officials would reply to the application by Easter.     Halvorsen said this is the first time Saga has applied to operate on OPEC-member Gabon\'s continental shelf, adding that Italian oil company Agip is heading a group of applicants in a separate bid for the same license.     Norsk Hydro has also applied for an undisclosed share in a single exploration license in which U.S. Oil company Tenneco has already been assigned operatorship, company spokesman Bjoern Tretvoll said.  \n',crude
'Norway has offered 10 new offshore blocks to foreign and domestic applicants in the first phase of the country\'s eleventh concession round, government officials said.     Company shares in each of the licences proposed by the Oil and Energy Ministry are not final. The ministry has given the companies 10 days to accept or decline the proposed shares.     French companies Ste Nationale Elf Aquitaine ELFP.PA and Total Cie Francaise des Petroles TPN.PA, which were expected to receive operatorships following France\'s agreement last autumn to purchase gas from Norway\'s Troll field, were not offered operatorships in this round, industry sources said.     Three eleventh round blocks were awarded in the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway, including the Smoerbukk West field where Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S STAT.OL (Statoil) was appointed operator.     Statoil will share the licence with subsidiaries of U.S. Oil companies Tenneco Inc TGT.N and Texas Eastern Corp TET.N and the Italian oil company Agip SpA\'s Norwegian subsidiary.     E.I. Du Pont de Nemours DD.N subsidiary Conoco Norway Inc was named operator on Haltenbanken block 6406/8 and will share the licence with Statoil.     Norsk Hydro A/S NHY.OL will operate nearby block 6407/10 with partners Statoil, Norsk Agip A/S, Royal Dutch/Shell Group\'s RD.AS A/S Norske Shell and Deminex unit Deminex (Norge) A/S.     Statoil has been offered the operatorship on a new block in the relatively unexplored Moere South exploration area south of Haltenbanken, with A/S Norske Shell, Texas Eastern and Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) also offered stakes in the block.     Norwegian companies landed operatorships on all six blocks opened in the Barents Sea area off northern Norway. The blocks were awarded in three licenses, each covering two blocks.     Statoil will head exploration on blocks 7224/7 and 7224/8, sharing the licence with Exxon Corp\'s XON.N Norwegian subsidiary Esso Norge A/S, The British Petroleum Co PLC\'s BP.L BP Petroleum Development (Norway) Ltd, Shell, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum A/S SAGP.OL.     Blocks 7219/9 and 7220/7 were awarded to Norsk Hydro, the operator, Statoil, Mobil Corp\'s MOB.N Mobil Exploration Norway, Petrofina SA\'s PETB.BR Norske Fina A/S and BP.     The third Barents Sea licence, covering blocks 7124/3 and 7125/1, went to Saga Petroleum A/S, the operator, Statoil, Atlantic Richfield Co\'s ARC.N Arco Norge A/S, Total Marine Norge A/S and Amerada Hess Corp AHC.N.     The oil ministry withheld awards on four strategic blocks included in the eleventh round\'s second phase.     The ministry is accepting applications for phase two blocks until early April and the awards will likely be announced this summer, officials said.  \n',crude
'The New York Mercantile Exchange said it will introduce exchanges for physicals (EFPS) to its energy futures markets April one.     An exchange spokeswoman said the change will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market.     EFPs, already in effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, are expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts.

'The New York Mercantile Exchange set April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.      On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.     \"This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world,\" said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.     Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.      The expanded program \"will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does,\" said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc.      The rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts.     Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction.     Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials.     When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December, NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, \"Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading.\"     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.  \n',crude
'Papua New Guinea (PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in the Asia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst Fereidun Fesharaki said here.     The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference.     Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacific petroleum outlook.     With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991, PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharaki said.     The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG.     The PNG government\'s Geological Survey in a paper distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at about 500 mln barrels.     PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with no secondary taxes, Fesharaki said.     \"We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, and discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to (light) Bass Strait crude,\" Fesharaki said.     There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to be produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.     But prices should be somewhat higher than the present levels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.     The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large prospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG.  \n',crude
'Top executives with Tenneco Corp TGT and Sabine Corp SAB said they expected world oil prices to gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on imports of oil from the Middle East grows.      \"I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a trend of gradually increasing prices,\" C.W. Nance, president of Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association.      Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the rate of 80 pct of capacity.     The gain will come largely through increased imports to the United States, he said.     \"They will be able to raise the price again but I do not think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979,\" Nance said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.      Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20 dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in 1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between 1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.      \"Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in increased demand,\" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry\'s outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15 pct, he said.      Tenneco\'s Nance also said that some U.S. cities may experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next winter because of the industry\'s reduced deliverability.      Tenneco\'s gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20 pct during 1986, he said.      \"This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,\" Nance said. \"We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three years before we start to climb out?\"       J.C. Walter of Walter Oil and Gas Corp, said the recent improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent producers to begin new onshore drilling projects.      \"If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,\" Walter said.      He suggested that some independents may instead turn to exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel, Walter said.  \n',crude
'Foreign oil companies will spend less on exploration in Indonesia this year than last, budgeting 2.7 billion dlrs for calendar 1987 against 1986 spending of 2.8 billion dlrs, the state oil company Pertamina said.     Actual spending last year fell short of the budgeted figure of 3.2 billion dlrs, as oil companies slashed expenditure because of the crash in world oil prices.     Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertamina\'s coordinating board for foreign contractors, said foreign companies will drill 110 exploration wells and 431 development wells this year, against 108 and 330 last year.  \n',crude
'Crude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia\'s determined effort to support prices, analysts said.     \"The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting,\" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.     \"But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,\" he added.     Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december.     The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers\' meeting the previous week.     The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.     \"They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales,\" Margoshes said.     He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.     Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.     Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart.     Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, \"both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally.\"     He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions.     Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market.     Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments.     North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.     OPEC members\' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.     Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.     \"The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result,\" Margoshes said.     Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.     But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short.     Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986.  \n',crude

'A House taxwriter said Energy Secretary James Herrington\'s \"outrageous\" plan to restore an old tax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy.     Rep. Pete Stark, a California Democrat and senior House Ways and Means Committee member, said Herrington\'s plan for a 27.5 pct depletion allowance--which in effect is a special 27.5 pct tax deduction --would cost seven billion dlrs a year.     \"He must have missed the last two years of federal tax reform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle,\" Stark said.

'Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said OPEC is deliberately under its production ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels to defend its 18 dlr a barrel price target.     He told reporters at an energy conference in Jakarta that OPEC had decided to maintain its price level of 18 dlrs.     \"We are deliberately defending the price, so OPEC production is less than 15.8 (mln) at the moment,\" he stated.     Asked if OPEC would increase production if prices went above 18 dlrs a barrel, he said this would be decided at the next OPEC meeting in June. \"We will discuss the market situation then,\" he added.     He said a meeting of the OPEC Differentials Committee had been postponed because \"there is no need for the meeting.\"     He did not elaborate.

'OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.     \"The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems,\" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA.     Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.     \"OPEC\'s problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way,\" said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.     He said the market\'s earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.     But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.     \"OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,\" said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. \"The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again,\" he added.     David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.     \"They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens,\" Mizrahi said.     But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.\"     Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC\'s ability to hold together prices and output.     \"OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then,\" said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.     But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University\'s Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production.     \"Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production,\" he tolds in a telephone interview.  \n',crude
'Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices.     Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, tolds in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     \"We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,\" he said. \"I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work,\" he said.     Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures.     Told of as survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said; \"That could well be correct.\"     Opec\"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was \"well below\" its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures.     But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.     The survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd.     Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.     Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.     Lukman said that some industry reports \"may be correct\" that in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.     He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States\" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.     However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.     \"We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals,\" he said, adding that he expected it to go \"up and up\" even beyond official prices after early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria\"s.     The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products.     Also, some of Venezuela\"s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said.     Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to \"dangerous levels,\" they would eventually have to buy Opec oil.     \"When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on,\" he said.     Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak.     He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment.     \"At this time, we have to get our priorities right,\" he said. \"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades.\"     But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.  \n',crude
'OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.     He told a news conference here \"After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices.\"     Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.     \"We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February,\" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.     Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva.     The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.     Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level.     \"The idea was to suggest that OPEC\'s agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,\" Lukman said.     He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC\'s 13 members, adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd.     Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement, while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.     \"If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs,\" the group\'s president said.     He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.     \"Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to,\" he said.     Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied \"We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.\"     Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude.     \"We don\'t see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,\" Lukman said.     The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he said had contributed to the group\'s efforts to stabilise prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market.     \"We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world\'s reserves in OPEC hands, the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly,\" he said.     Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador\'s output following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster.  \n',crude
'OPEC output in February was \"well below\" the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries are strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying.     The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result \"of member countries\' firm determination to defend the organisation\'s official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price.\"     The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25.     The official gave no figure for February output. The statement said only that \"the reduction in total supplies, namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month.\"     \"No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price, member countries are, without exception, strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hardship this may entail,\" the statement said.     \"The very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price,\" the statement said.     Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a barrel in early December last year to near OPEC\'s official levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact.     There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main markets.     The official said in the statement that no such emergency session was scheduled \"because of member countries\' firm determination to defend the price (system)\" agreed in December.     Opec\"s differential committee was to have met in Vienna starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no new date set, according to an official of the United Arab Emirates, which chairs the seven-state body.

'OPEC countries are all sticking firmly to official crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is likely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy Subroto tolds.     Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference, blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand. \"If we stick to the production limitation, the third quarter will be in better balance.\"     He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC\'s December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through.     Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices, Subroto said: \"Apparently they have taken care of that.\"     \"They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves. I think they\'ll help each other,\" he said.     Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC\'s Price Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date.     \"Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting because ...

Asked what Opec\'s output level was now, he replied: \"Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day).\" He did not elaborate.     He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel\'s December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties.     He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987.     He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting.     He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. \"We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters.\"     Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together.  \n',crude

'Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea.     Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens \"the military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions.\"     He said the activities of the research vessel could be aimed at partitioning the Aegean.     \"The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert,\" General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, told a news conference.     He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning.     Ergenc tolds later that all leave had been cancelled for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area.     The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey.      Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus.     The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover.     Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a government decision that Turkey should protect its interests \"because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in violation of international agreements.\"     Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the vessels, he said \"If there is an attack, it is clear what has to be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war.\" But he added \"We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the military are directed towards protecting our rights.\"     Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.     Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions Athens had attached.     In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations \"we will hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped with words.\"     Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only \"The Greek fleet is not at its naval base.\"     Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek continental shelf.     Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept it.     Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus.     He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied \"Obviously, and perhaps even before the war.\"  \n',crude
'The Papua New Guinea Government will establish a public corporation to invest in resources projects, Minerals and Energy Minister John Kaputin said.     \"We intend to provide a means through which less privileged individuals can become part owners and beneficiaries from the development of mining and petroleum projects,\" he told Parliament.     Existing policy allowing the state up to 30 pct equity in major mining projects and 22.5 pct in oil and gas projects would be maintained, he said. The planned agency could take over the state\'s equity in current developments.     Kaputin said Papua New Guinea was experiencing a boom with exploration companies spending about 60 mln kina annually on about 150 mining and 23 petroleum projects.     \"The Government is determined to ensure that Papua New Guinean ownership in minerals and petroleum projects increases in an orderly way,\" he said.     Kaputin did not say when the corporation would be established or exactly what form it would take, but said the government would study whether it should be directly involved in exploration or development.  \n',crude
'Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220 mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports, wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.     But the French bank\'s plan, which would effectively postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52 members of the loan syndicate.     The pipeline that carries all Ecuador\'s oil exports was ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair.     President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that Ecuador as a result would maintain January\'s suspension of interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.     Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador\'s export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.     Although sympathetic to Ecuador\'s plight, many banks in the Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job for international financial organizations and not for commercial banks, bankers said.     The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a Latin American nation since the region\'s debt crisis erupted in August 1982.     Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions for Latin borrowers will be set back.     \"There\'s a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel it\'s a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a restructuring would look bad,\" one banker commented.  \n',crude

'Mexican state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) signed for a 500 mln dlr&#127;untied loan from the Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance its Pacific Petroleum Project, Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said.     No further details on the loan were immediately available.     Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast.     The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery.     The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said.     Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project, he said. The new pipeline will enable Japan to load Mexico\'s Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan diversify its supply sources of that product, he added.  \n',crude
'Pennzoil Co said it had not yet received any \"meaningful settlement offer\" from Texaco Inc but added that the company remained willing to consider proposals to settle the 10.2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against Texaco.     In its newly-released annual report to shareholders, Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be upheld if appealed again.     \"To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful settlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any realistic effort to settle the matter,\" Pennzoil chairman Hugh Liedtke said in the annual report.     Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year.     Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to 964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program, Pennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985.      The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339 mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17 pct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by 60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said.

The company\'s total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs.     Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to maintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of Mexico\'s Mobile Bay area.     \"Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California,\" the company said. \"Pennzoil\'s share of this production initially should be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of 15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989.\"     In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled 2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985.

'Petro-Canada, Canada\'s state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland.     Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.     Depending on time required for regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as early as 1991, Petro-Canada said.     \"We have a high degree of confidence that the western portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels, and that we could produce it economicly using a floating production system,\" Petro-Canada said.     The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St. John\'s and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984.     \"We\'ve had encouraging results from the eastern portion of the field, and we hope this summer\'s drilling will prove up additional reserves there,\" the company said.     Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources towards development so it can start generating a return on investments, Petro-Canada said.     Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells, has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field\'s East Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd, Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.     Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field\'s Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil, company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada\'s Calgary office.     Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field\'s East Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels, he added.     Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the development budget could double if the company builds a production system combining both blocks in the field, he said.     Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily production, with a production system that would have maximum capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in answer to a query.

'Brazil\'s state-oil company Petrobras has asked the Army to withdraw the troops which were occupying its oil installations since Tuesday, Petrobras said in a statement.     The statement said the request for the withdrawal of the troops was made because of the calmness reigning in all of its refineries.     \"The request was also due to the end of the seamen\'s strike and the willingness of the oil industry workers to sit again by the negotiating table,\" the statement said.

'Brazil\'s state oil company Petrobras has cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil and did not disclose reasons, a Petrobras official said.     Export director Carlos Santana told reporters the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil\'s decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of consumption.     He said the Saudis reported they would no longer accept letters of credit from the Bank of Brazil or even from Saudi banks and that Brazil would have to obtain credit guarantees from leading international banks.     In February, Brazil had contracted to buy 125,000 bpd from the Saudis until June. Saudi Arabia is Brazil\'s second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.     \"If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship...I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere,\" Santana added.     Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment.     The Saudis had put similar conditions on a previous shipment, he added. \"We telexed them saying that if they insisted, we would rather cancel the contract and buy the product elsewhere,\" Santana said.

In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement.     \"We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions,\" he said.     Kuwait\'s Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said in remarks published in the emirate\'s daily Al-Qabas there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices.     Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling.     They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing.  \n',crude
'King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group.     His plea, in an interview withs and the television news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make to Britain later this month.     King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price agreed to by OPEC last December.     The King replied: \"Saudi Arabia doesn\'t decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability.\"     Non-OPEC countries \"must help us in a framework of common interest so that there is no type of competition which could prove harmful to everyone,\" he said.     Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher benchmark.     In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure, due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd said Saudi Arabia, the world\'s largest oil exporter, was adhering to decisions made at OPEC\'s December conference which set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987.     A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the group\'s pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.     The King also urged the world community to help the Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful end to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not be resolved on the battlefield, he said.  \n',crude
'Saudi Arabian business leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom\'s oil-dependent economy.     The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices.     The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea, has been organised by Saudi Arabia\'s chambers of commerce.     Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day.     Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year\'s slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance.     Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia, the world\'s largest crude exporter, needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy.     The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans.     Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel.     With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a 52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves.     The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community.     Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non-performing loans.     But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate finance manager in Riyadh said: \"Banks are still reluctant to lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am not sure if it is firmly based.\"     Some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy may still be contracting.     Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply. A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the budget said: \"While industrialisation has continued to be one of the government\'s highest priorities, the recession, the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi and foreign investor interest in industry.\"     It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here.     Official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March 1986, compared with the same period in 1985.     Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983.     Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit.     Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories. Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments.     The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of bank debt.     Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to step up investment in the kingdom.     A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft worth five billion stg.  \n',crude
'Saudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources said.     They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju\'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers.     But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.     The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country\'s output for Opec purposes.     Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.     The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end.     Last week\'s high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia\'s main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.     The four -- Exxon Corp XON, Mobil Corp MOB, Texaco Inc TX and Chevron Corp CHV -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.     However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia\'s ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.     Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom\'s commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices.     The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries.     They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain\'s refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each.  \n',crude
'Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC\'s December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it.     Nazer, in an interview withs and the television news agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC quota.     Saudi Arabia, the world\'s largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact, Nazer said.     The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.     Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: \"I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled.\"     Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements.     \"We\'ve heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified,\" he said.     OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.     Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.     Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.     \"As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement,\" he said.     Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, Nazer said.     King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview withs and Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC.     \"Saudi Arabia doesn\'t decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability,\" he said.     Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of \"swing producer\" within OPEC.     Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states.     \"Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC,\" Nazer said.     Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.     But he said if circumstances changed \"I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures.\"     Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer.     Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC\'s behalf earlier this year.     \"We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions,\" Nazer said.

'Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of the kingdom\'s determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources said.     They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average of 3.5 mln bpd.     They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be counted towards a member\'s production quota. Saudi Arabia\'s quota is 4.133 mln bpd.     The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the world\"s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the sources said.     King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview withs and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi commitment to OPEC\'s December pact to boost oil prices to an average 18 dlrs.     \"Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,\" he said.     The sources said the kingdom\'s exports from Gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday, down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd.     They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain artificially high levels by putting oil into storage.     The kingdom\'s main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon, Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay official prices, the sources said.     Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.     They expected low early March output to pick up towards the end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual obligations.  \n',crude
'Saudi riyal interbank deposits were steady at yesterday\'s higher levels in a quiet market.

'Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.     Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.     \"Over the next few weeks I think you\'ll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down,\" Wellemeyer said.     \"The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a barrel) and are willing to make it happen again,\" he said.     In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.     Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.     Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the world demand for oil.  \n',crude

'The Senate budget committee sits down tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with the budget writers expected to look at several proposals for fuel taxes and other tax options to cut the budget.     In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number of revenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrs a barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just on imported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energy consumption based on five pct of value.     Other proposals include various excise taxes and combinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10 pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise 22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years.     The committee, however, will only include revenue numbers in its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left to the House and Senate tax-writing committees.      The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, Sen Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, said he hopes would raise at least 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36 billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind.

U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750 mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.     The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private group, also called for new research for oil exploration and development techniques.     It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.

'A government study has concluded the U.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability, the New York Times said.     The newspaper said the inter-agency government study found a serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily falling domestic production and rising demand for imported oil.     The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relying on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peak of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.     The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from 27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said.     It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the current 8.4 mln barrels.     The newspaper said the administration has placed increased emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now held is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times of shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day, rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget.    The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the depletion allowance to major producers.     \"The administration also plans to renew its efforts to ...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling on the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers,\" it added.

Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which is limiting supplies.     In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Monday\'s report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders said.     Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.     Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales have been lighter than expected this week.     The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.     Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength related to tight supplies.     Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat packers to bid aggressively for available animals.     However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start of the year.     New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.  \n',crude
'Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells.     Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers.     His proposal to revitalize Texas\' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state\'s 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas\' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production.     Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.     Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel.     \"We\'ve been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,\" Nugent said. \"In other words, let\'s tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way.\"     Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry.  \n',crude

'British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her government\'s oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil prices.     She said the government was determined not to intervene to influence production decisions by oil companies operating in the North Sea.     \"We believe these must be a matter for the commercial judgment of the oil companies,\" she told the Arabic language daily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit to London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.     Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel.     British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to increase in the future, she said.     \"We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility for both producer and consumer countries,\" Thatcher said.     \"On our part, we are careful to avoid any actions which might add to such volatility.\"  \n',crude

The drilling, diving and supply vessels sectors had been most affected, Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energy committee. He noted, however, that oil companies were still spending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production.     He added that a report by the manpower services committee which said 14,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1986 should be seen in the context of a total workforce of 300,000.     Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of 8.50 dlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs the previous November.     They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after last December\'s OPEC meeting and Brent traded today around 17.15 dlrs.     Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adopting OPEC style quotas, noting that Britian is an oil-consuming as well as an oil-producing nation.  \n',crude
'Energy Secretary John Herrington said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration.     \"These options boost production, while avoiding the huge costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,\" Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. \"It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review.\"     He said proposals, including an increase in the oil depletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax, should be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at the least cost to the economy and the taxpayers.     \"The goal of the Administration policies is to increase domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a year.\"     The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday warning the United States was threatened by a growing dependence on oil imports.     \"We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65 pct by 1995,\" Herrington said.     He said it was too soon to say what the Administration policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would be opposition to tax changes.     \"Of course, to move forward with these kinds of options would require reopening tax issues settled last year (in the tax reform bill) -- an approach which has not, in general, been favored by the administration. I think what we need is to debate this within the Administration,\" he said.     He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices.     Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today\'s Washington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging an increase in the oil depletion allowance.     Asked about the report by subcommittee members, Herrington said various proposals were under consideration and would be debated within the Administration to determine which would have the most benefits at the least cost.  \n',crude
'an eventual oil import fee in the united states will make no difference to champlin petroleum corp\'s joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa), champlin chairman william adams said.     \"this was an aspect which was discussed at length during the negotiations, but we can say our contract covers all eventualities in this regard,\" he tolds during the signing ceremony here.     Venezuela\'s energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsa buys 50 pct of champlin\'s corpus christi refinery, as \"one more step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in world markets.\"    union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will be beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source of supply with a modern refinery and access to markets.     \"we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a time of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are clear benefits to both sides,\" he said.     Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and obtain a competitive product yield.     \"therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact on today\'s agreement,\" adams said.     He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as venezuela\'s bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without any difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet to take advantage of bigger margins.     The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd of venezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pct yield of white products.  \n',crude
'A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies.     The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the Reagan administration\'s controversial off-shore leasing program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.     The administration said that the court-ordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980.     A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos.     But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration.     \"Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable,\" Justice Byron White wrote for the court. \"And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined,\" he said.     The oil companies, Amoco Corp AN, ARCO, Exxon Corp XON, Mobil Corp MOB, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc TX and Union Oil, had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses.     The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs.     Administration officials, saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.     The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with an organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing.  \n',crude
'Tonight\'s American Petroleum Institute weekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns in distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27, analysts and traders said.     They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln barrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3 and four mln barrels.     Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5 mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from the previous week or slightly higher or lower.     For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between 700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance gasoline stocks will be unchanged.     API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels.     The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal factors but they said crude direction is harder to call.     Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between 3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended March 27.     API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up three pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said utilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by less than one pct for the week ended March 27.     Moderate product stockdraws would strengthen the market slightly, analysts said. But bullish expectations are already partially reflected in today\'s gains, they added.  \n',crude
'Energy Secretary John Herrington said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to spur domestic production.     The White House has said it would consider the option although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new tax code.     Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a year.     The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and the national security the Energy Department sent to the White House on Tuesday.     Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance option: \"that is one that could significantly increase production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer.\"     He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to the overall U.S. economy.  \n',crude
'The U.S. oil and gas industry is in better health than it was a year ago, according to testimony given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of the industry hearing today.      The Commission, which regulates the state\'s oil and gas industry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry downturn had bottomed out.      \"The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal more optimistic (than last year),\" Commissioner James E. (Jim) Nugent tolds.      \"It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are seeing the bottom of the economic cycle,\" he added, \"and with just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move again.\"      The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil prices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to around 18 dlrs a barrel.      At the same time, a number of company executives testified that the nation\'s domestic exploration and production segment was still hurting and in need of government help.      Production costs are considerably higher in the United States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell many domestic producers were forced to shut down their operations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs operating in the United States compared with an average of nearly 2,000 in 1985.      Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of Energy, many said the falling production of domestic oil coupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing dependency on imports, particularly from the politically volatile Middle East.      \"In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower prices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day (bpd),\" said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply Department at Exxon Corp XON, the nation\'s largest oil company.      At the same time, Simon said \"U.S. oil production declined by 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years,\" and \"net petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd.\"      Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC\'s ability to control production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at 1986 levels, leading to \"a significant amount of spare worldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd.\"      He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued volatility and called for \"governmental and regulatory policies in support of the domestic petroleum industry.\"      Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal government through the 1986 tax code changes and \"Superfund\" legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall profits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access to federal lands for oil and gas exploration.      Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the industry have called for as a way of building up the nation\'s domestic operations before imports reach such a level that national security might be compromised.      In yesterday\'s report, the Energy Department said imports could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the free world\'s total oil consumption by that date.      Arguing that \"oil is a political tool in every nation on earth,\" Frank Pitts, chairman of Pitts Oil Co, today called for a variable oil import fee, among other measures, \"before the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and our national security is compromised.\"      Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co, agreed, saying that like many federal government programs that were set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a \"shambles.\"      Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future. \"For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is over,\" he said.      Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co, said he was \"enthusiastic about the future,\" adding that he expected \"an increase in profitability by midyear.\"  \n',crude
'U.S. Department of Energy Secretary John Herrington said he was \"optimistic\" about the chances of providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas producers, but added that the plan faces strong opposition from some members of the Reagan administration.     Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at a breakfast meeting, said administration debate over his plan for a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was \"heavy and strong\" largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the agriculture industry.     Herrington\'s proposed tax incentives for the oil industry were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a comprehensive report finding U.S. national security could be jeopardized by rising oil imports.     In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and Development Corp MND chairman, George Mitchell, Herrington said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import tarrif. \"We intend to keep that debate open,\" Herrington said.     However, following his speech, Herrington tolds that the new report shows an oil import fee \"is not economical.\"     Herrington said, for example, a 10 dlr per barrel tariff on oil imports would cause the nation\'s gross national product to drop by as much as 32 billion dlrs.     Herrington also said he believed President Reagan, who requested the comprehensive national security study, was committed to some action to help the ailing U.S. oil industry.     \"I\'m quite confident he understands the problems and is prepared to do something about it,\" Herrington said.  \n',crude

Reagan administration officials said later that Washington did not seek military confrontation with Tehran, but would not let Iran use Chinese-made \"Silkworm\" anti-ship missiles, capable of covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf, to choke oil shipments to the West.     Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection for up to a dozen vessels, most of them tankers, could be provided by three U.S. Navy destroyers and two frigates now in the southern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.     In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy\'s small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships, including the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, into the northern Arabian Sea in the past month.

'A White House-ordered report said  that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security.     The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.     President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry.     Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that \"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years, this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.\"     The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.     Among the report\'s options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.     President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s.     The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would depress the nation\'s economy.

'The \"cross field allowance\" relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.     The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.     A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field.     \"The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability,\" the report said, adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced.     The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax, the report said.     On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.     In a study on probable fields, the report said that when the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9 pct.     The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field\'s future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost.     Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time.  \n',crude
'Petroleos de Venezuela S.A will announce within two weeks the name of a foreign consortium it has chosen to help exploit the coal deposits at Guasare in western Zulia state, PDVSA president Juan Chacin Guzman said.     Chacin told reporters the foreign partner will provide capital as well as technical and marketing expertise to the Carbozulia project, which the state oil company will manage.     PDVSA officials said that among those who bid for the partnership is a consortium between Agip Carbone, a subsidiary of Italy\'s Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI), and Atlantic Richfield ARC of the United States.     Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said discussions are currently taking place to finalize the terms of the contract with the foreign partner.     PDVSA vice-president Pablo Reimpell said last week the first shipment of coal from the Carbozulia project should be made during the final quarter of 1987, and would measure between 100-150,000 metric tons.     Plans call for production to eventually reach 500,000 mt annually. Reimpell said the original investment in the project will be approximately 8 billion bolivars.  \n',crude
'Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today.     He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a visit here this week by Ecuador\'s Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in August.     Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to offsetting the loss of Ecuador\'s 140,000 in exports caused by earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week.     Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao was put out of action.     Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador\'s is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.     Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs.     The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries.     \"If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this country would have ground to a halt,\" he said.  \n',crude
'venezuela will supply ecuador with an as yet undetermined amount of crude oil to help it meet export commitments, seriously affected by last week\'s earthquake, energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti said.     He gave few details about the deal, but said a crude oil loan agreement will be made between state oil companies petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa) and ecuador\'s cepe.     Ecuador was forced to suspend oil exports for an expected four months after an earthquake damaged a pipeline. Oil accounts for 60 per cent of its export income.      Hernandez was speaking to reporters at miraflores palace on the results of talks with ecuador\'s deputy energy minister fernando santos alvite, who arrived here last night.     \"the volume lent to ecuador would be discounted from its opec quota and would not affect venezuela\'s,\" he said. \"we would from august on produce our own quota and sell the additional amounts that ecuador would be repaying us,\" he said.     He did not elaborate on the quota arrangements but did say ecuador would notify opec by telex that venezuela would be lending it a certain amount over so many days.     Venezuela\'s opec output quota is currently 1.495 million barrels a day, and ecuador\'s has been set at 210,000 bpd.  \n',crude
'Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5 mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments and its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement.     Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake.     Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export commitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crude and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said.      Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that would take an estimated five  months.     Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for refining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired.     Both countries are the only Latin American members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).     Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before the earthquake, Energy Ministry officials said. Its total output was around 260,000 bpd.  \n',crude
'Venezuela\'s state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. wants to raise its worldwide refining capacity by 150,000 barrels of per day, a company official attending the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting here said.     He declined to be identified but said PdVSA has the capacity to refine about 650,000 bpd of crude oil from refining centers in Venezuela, Sweden, West Germany, Belgium, and the United States. The company recently purchased a 50 pct stake in the Corpus Christi, Texas refinery of Champlin Petroleum Co, a subsidiary of Union Pacific Corp UNP.     Earlier it bought a similar stake in the Lake Charles, La refinery owned by Citgo Petroleum Corp, a unit of Southland Corp SLC.      According to the official, Venezuela is searching worldwide for the additional refining capacity but he did not mention where the company was looking.      Refineries abroad, he said, guarantee a refining outlet for Venezuelan crude oil while ensuring stability of supply to refiners.     He said Venezuela currently  produces about 1.4 mln bpd of crude oil, which is in line with its 1.495 bpd OPEC ceiling.  \n',crude
'Venezuela has still to work out final details of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports caused by earthquake damage, a senior Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) official said.     \"We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be affected,\" he said during the signing of a joint venture deal with Union Pacific Corp today.     He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by Ecuador\'s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite.     He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be considered. Venezuela, possibly unique among oil exporters, requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to ensure its oil is not resold on the spot market.     Ecuador\'s oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador\'s account and remit the revenues to Quito. Ecuador would pay back the oil at a rate of 35,000 bpd.     He said Venezuela\'s oil would be traded through Ecuadorean state oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company never allows third parties to trade its oil.  \n',crude

'The National Wildlife Federation  rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration.     The federation, the nation\'s largest conservation group, said further study was needed to assess any possible damage that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.     Jay Hair, the federation\'s executive vice president, called the Interior\'s research into the effects of development \"so fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on which to make a public policy decision.\"     Hair called the department\'s proposal a \"reflection of a largely political decision,\" adding \"we have no confidence in Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area.\"     Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough  safeguards to protect the area\'s caribou and musk-oxen.     It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration.     Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10 billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain.     Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development.     Hair said Interior\'s report failed to stress the probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct.     He said Interior\'s study also failed to weigh oil, gas, fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection Agency on the possible effects of exploration.     The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the issue and report back to Congress in about two years.     Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible exploration of oil, only that Interior\'s study was inadquate to make a sound judgement.     Congressional observers said that at present there was little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil.  \n',crude
'World Bank president Barber Conable pledged the Bank\'s support to help Indonesia adjust to lower world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its protected economy was needed.     Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto, he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy.     Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third World\'s sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years.     Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices.     \"We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,\" he said.     He said Jakarta\'s willingness to move quickly after last year\'s collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries.     Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy.     However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place.     Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met 14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country\'s borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the country.  \n',crude
'World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia, the Third World\'s sixth largest debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said.     Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers.     He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia\'s largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments.     Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia\'s most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely hit by last year\'s crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and gas revenues in half.     Japan\'s state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.     Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31 pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit.     Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia\'s high-cost protected economy.     \"Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call for major policy adjustments and external support,\" Conable said in his arrival statement.     But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes.     \"We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed,\" Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport.     Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the Third World\'s sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.     Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.     Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government\'s trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.     Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment.     Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia\'s 215 state-run companies could be sold.     But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.     Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia\'s high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy.     Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices.     It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation.      He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector.     Indonesia\'s current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87.  \n',crude
'The world\'s dependency on the Mideast as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon Corp XON Director and senior vice president tolds in an interview.     \"Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable,\" McIvor said.     Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said.     McIvor, Exxon\'s senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideast\'s large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.     \"Since 1970 we\'ve been consuming oil at rates of 20-25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10-15 bilion barrels per year,\" McIvor said.     \"The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity,\" he added.     McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 \"one-one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.\"     McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not believe there were any more \"super giants\", or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which would change the conclusion of the world\'s growing dependency.     \"Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east (Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska\'s North Slope).\" McIvor said.     McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S. like Alaska\'s Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline.     But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and Australia and Africa.     McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies.     \"The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies,\" McIvor said.     McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy.     Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but \"the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase U.S. production.\"     McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs.     \"Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkd\'s energy supply,\" McIvor said.     \"Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an industrial fuel,\" he added.  \n',crude
